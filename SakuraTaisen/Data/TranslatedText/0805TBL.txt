﻿It's a photo of Sakura. She's looking right at me. I wonder what she's thinking…
It's a photo of Sumire. This is a side of her you don't see too often.
It's a photo of Maria. …She's lost in thought and looks kind of sad…
A photo of Kanna. She looks strong and reliable. I can't wait to meet her.
A photo of Iris. She's surrounded by flowers and flashing a radiant smile.
A photo of Kohran. She's looking pretty in profile with her face dyed red by the evening sun.
A letter given to me by a customer. I was asked to give it to Sumire. I have a bad feeling about this…
Maria's pistol. This may help me escape from here…
A hair ornament. It's decorated with flowers and looks very elegant.
A pretty pendant. The delicate workmanship is gorgeous.
A hairpin for use in a traditional bun hairstyle. It would complement a formal outfit well.
This key will let me enter rooms I couldn't before.
I found this in a bedroom on the second floor. I can use it to access the back room.
A teacup Iris asked me to get for her. It has a very stylish design.
This is the matchbox Iris asked for. Its logo is quite colorful.
A knife Iris asked me to get for her. Just a normal utensil you'd use during a meal.
A prop sword and shield used onstage. They're well-made and look just like the real thing.
A prop crown used onstage. It's well constructed and incredibly detailed.
A wig and costume used onstage. I wonder what kind of act could use a flashy outfit like this?
A photo of Sakura in her swimsuit. Wow, this is really something. I'm gonna treasure this.
A photo of Sumire in her stage costume. Her distinctive makeup really makes an impact.
It's a photo of Maria on stage in the military uniform from "For Love"… She's a beautiful woman disguised as a man.
A photo of Kanna in her training gear. Catching her in a private moment like this feels surprisingly intimate.
A photo of Iris in her swimsuit. She's holding a rubber ring and looks ready to have some fun. How cute.
A photo of Kohran. I don't get to see her with her braids undone very often. It's a nice look.
A photo of Ayame in a traditional outfit. I hope she'll always be as happy and content as she is here.
Ayame's gun. Why…? Why did it have to turn out like this…?
Jean-Paul the teddy bear. Iris's best friend. She always carries him with her and takes good care of him.
The alarm!? The Koma are here! 
…All right. Let's show them our special training paid off! 
Phew… It's really relaxing to be alone in your own room once in a while… 
I'd love to just sit down for a minute, but I guess I should talk to everyone first. 
OK, let's go. 
Sakura's room… It's been a while since I've been here. 
Guess I'll head somewhere else. 
Sakura… It's Ogami… 
She doesn't seem to be here. 
Kanna's room… It's been a while since I've been here. 
Guess I'll head somewhere else. 
No one here, it seems. 
Maria's room… It's been a while since I've been here. 
Why don't I go check somewhere else. 
…She's not here? We just came back together. I wonder where she could have run off to. 
I hope Sumire is in her room… 
Guess I'll head somewhere else. 
She doesn't seem to be here. 
Ayame's room. I haven't been her in some time… 
I should go somewhere else. 
Ayame seems to be away. 
It's no use. I should leave. 
Sumire seems to be gone already. 
I didn't know about her reasons, but still… I'm afraid I was too harsh. 
At first glance, the capital looks peaceful. People are going about their daily lifes as if nothing's wrong. 
If the Koma attacked for real, they would turn this town into a living hell in an instant. 
I really wonder what we can do against them without our Kobu. 
The Imperial Theater was closed while everyone was away for their special training. 
No one here, so I should probably leave. 
The strong sunlight of Winter is even coming in here. 
The weather is nice. Perfect day to go out. 
…There's no one here. Is everyone in their rooms? 
There's nothing to do here, so I should check another room. 
I wonder if the manager is around. 
…Nothing to do here. Let's go. 
Yoneda doesn't seem to be in. Probably gone out to restock his booze… 
Huh…? They're both not here, even though the New Year's holiday should be over now… 
Are they working somewhere else? 
In any case, if they aren't here, there's no point in me hanging around here either. 
No one here. Looks like I have to go someplace else. 
Has everyone gone to their rooms? 
Since there haven't been any shows lately, this room hasn't seen any use in some time. 
A dressing room without any people in it isn't exactly a cheerful place. Let's go somewhere else. 
This room is still a mess… 
I should go somewhere else. There's nothing to do in this room when I'm not on duty. 
Since we did that big end-of-year cleaning, the floor is spotless. 
I guess there's no reason why anyone would be here. Let's go somewhere else. 
No one here. It's too early for people to eat here. 
Why don't I go check somewhere else. 
I had hoped I'd find Kanna eating here… 
Tsubaki is on vacation too? I'd hoped I could buy some portrait cards today… 
I haven't worked as a ticket puncher for three weeks… 
I almost miss it. 
No shows in the theater. I was happy we were closed on New Year. 
But since everyone's doing special training, the shows in January have all been canceled. 
The Great Imperial Theater is bound to have a massive loss of revenue. 
…No one here. 
I wonder when the shows will start again… 
When I look at the costumes, I can't wait… But oh well. 
I guess there's no reason why anyone would be here. 
I should move on. 
No one here. Exercising alone is no fun… 
I should get going. Let's see where everyone is. 
This pool is heated by steam engines in the basement. 
I'd like to go for a swim, but I guess I should talk to the other Flower Division members first… 
It's empty now that Sakura left. 
…Oh well. I'd better go, too. 
There's a pleasant soapy smell here, and the air feels warm. 
Probably because Sakura took a shower here. 
I should leave before the warm air makes me dizzy. 
I really hope no one will have to use this place this year… 
Good health is the most important thing after all. 
This is where the Flower Division assembles when the alarm goes off. 
Let's pray that it doesn't, as long as our Kobu are in the garage… 
Even the mighty steam processor couldn't warn us about the appearance of the Koma. 
They were sealed six years ago… No one could have anticipated their return. 
Around New Year's Day, all of us were here discussing what we could do against the Koma… 
The Koma… What a formidable enemy. 
I haven't been here for three weeks. 
It's been some time since we've been at the Imperial Theater. 
Captain… I'd like to speak with you. 
Wh-what!? Why are you so formal, all of a sudden? 
I wanted to give you my sincerest thanks for allowing me to accompany you on the special training. 
I haven't had such a productive training in ages. 
No, no! I should be the one thanking YOU, Maria. 
This special training was my idea, but you stuck with it till the end. I'm really grateful! 
Thank you. By the way, do you still remember our instructor at the shooting range? 
That Lieutenant Commander who got all starry-eyed in front of you? Of course I remember him! 
He was really surprised you're an actress too… He even wanted to come here to see you perform. 
Hehe… Why I never! 
What…? Oh, the Boss and Maria! Since when are you back? 
Oh… Seems like you found us! 
It's good to be back! 
Welcome back! Sakura just came back a short while ago. 
You look like you're in a good mood, Kanna. 
Ogami! Maria! Welcome back! 
Nice to see you again, Sakura. 
(It's all dusty. But this dust is Sakura's mark of pride.) 
Ah… These clothes got all dirty. I have to change right now… 
Don't worry, Sakura. It just shows how hard you've been training. 
…Yes, I guess that's right. 
(It's her usual clothes…) 
(Her black hair looks nice and silky.) 
(Long and beautiful hair… She's a true Japanese beauty.) 
(There's a fire in her eyes. The training really wiped that worried look from before off her face!) 
What is it, Ogami? 
I was just thinking you have such a determined look about you. 
Hehe… Really? 
(Her eyes are sparkling.) 
(She looks like a different person compared to New Year's day.) 
Is there something wrong with my face? 
You look like you're ready to take on anything. 
Oh, you think so? …You'll make me blush! 
(She looks lean.) 
Ogami… At last I get to see you again… 
What's wrong, Sakura? 
… 
…Oh, sorry. I'm so happy, I was lost for words… 
… 
Heeey, what are you doing, Sakura? You're not a little girl, so pull yourself together! 
S-sorry… I'm acting all weird, aren't I? 
Did your special training work out? 
Yes! 
I had to work really hard. Maybe my sword skills deteriorated because we were only practicing. 
It went great for me! I wrestled down a wild bull with my bare hands. 
A… A bull!? 
Impressive… 
Hehe… I feel like I've come one step closer to match my dad! 
I've lost a little weight due to my training. I feel lighter than I have in a long time. 
Let's do some sparring together some time again. 
You'll have to hold back against me! 
(Kanna… She looks even stronger than before.) 
(She's so big, but not a gram of fat on her body… Impressive!) 
(Even her hair is wild and independent.) 
(She's certainly found her own style.) 
(Whoa, there are blood stains on her chest!) 
Why are you so interested in my breasts? 
Kanna… Are you hurt? 
Oh, that's nothing. Don't worry, Boss. 
(…Incredible!) 
(She looks… liberated, somehow.) 
…Something the matter? You've been staring me in the eyes for some time now. 
I was just thinking, I like that determined look in your eyes. 
Of course. The training would have been worthless otherwise. 
(Her eyes are brimming with confidence.) 
(What a gallant face.) 
(There's a cut on her cheek. It must have been an arduous special training.) 
Boss… 
What is it, Kanna? 
…… 
I have to admit… I was thinking about you during my training… 
Huh…? 
After all, we had to start the special training right after our New Year's shrine visit. 
I felt bad because I hadn't even said thank you for inviting me… 
Please… There's no need to thank me. 
Hehe… But seeing you again now like this… It's like a dream come true. 
Kanna… 
Ahem! It seems like you two have completely forgotten about the rest of us!? 
I have to agree, you two look a bit TOO happy… 
Oh… I'm sorry! When I saw his face, I just couldn't… 
…S-sorry. 
By the way, how is everyone else doing? 
Iris is in her room. She was tired from playing and went to have a nap. 
… 
Kohran still seems to be tinkering in her room. I heard an explosion earlier. 
Sumire was sitting in the parlor. She didn't do any special training and just went out every day. 
Oh boy… 
I expect you'll want to check on all of them? 
You're right, that's a good idea. 
The alarm!? The Koma are here! 
…All right. Let's show them our special training paid off! 
I wonder if Iris is all right. I haven't seen her in a while. 
She's probably still sleeping. 
I should go somewhere else. 
I should leave for now. I wouldn't want to wake her up. 
Yes, who is it? 
Huh? That sounds like Ayame. 
Ogami? Please come in! 
Ayame! It's great to see you again! 
It's nice to have you back, Ogami. You look much stronger than before! 
Thank you very much! 
So… What brings you here? 
I'm here to see you. <br> I'm here to see Iris. <br> Why are YOU here? 
I'm here to see you. It's been three weeks, after all. 
Hehe… I wonder if I should believe you… 
No, it's true! I… 
I don't want to sound ungrateful, but… 
Right now, the members of the Flower Division need you more than I do. 
Some time has passed since what happened on New Year's day, but we can hardly relax just yet. 
I suppose. 
I'm sorry, Ogami. It seems like all I do is give you stern advice… 
It's all right. Without your advice… 
I'd have given up this whole thing a long time ago. 
…I don't think that's true. 
You've made great progress… Soon, you won't need my advice anymore. 
A-Ayame! 
The Flower Division is built on all its members, and on you, Ogami! 
…So do your best! 
…Understood. 
I'm here to see Iris, after I've been away for so long. 
But she still seems to be in bed. 
Iris is at that age now where kids can never get enough sleep. I'm sure you were the same once. 
Why are YOU here? 
Me? I just went to check on Iris. 
Iris is in the middle of a growth spurt. When I come here, I often find her sleeping like this. 
Hehe… Did you some to see Iris? 
…Y-yes. 
Ogami. You should tell Iris you're home. 
Iris, I'm back. 
Zzzzz… Zzzzz… 
Hahaha… She looks so innocent. 
Did you notice… about Iris, I mean? 
Hm? What do you mean? 
Iris needs her sleep right now. 
It's important for her growth, both mentally and physically. 
All right, see you later. I'll be in my room if you need me. 
Mentally and physically? Hmmm… 
That really is more important for her right now than any special training could ever be, huh? 
See you, Iris… Sweet dreams. 
So, I checked up on Iris… Let's see how everyone else is doing. 
…Enemies!? The Koma have finally made their move! 
Wake up, Iris! We have to move out! 
Uh… Huh…? Is that you, Mon Frère? 
She went ahead to the control room! 
I haven't been in Kohran's room in a long time… 
Let's go see the others. 
OK! 
It's me, Ogami… Can I come in? 
Finally you're back, Chief! I was getting impatient! 
Whoa, it really is you, Chief… 
It's good to see you, Kohran! How have you been doing? 
Everything's peachy! 
Let's not stand around here, get inside! 
OK…I'm coming in. 
Chief? Long time no see! 
If the door's open, you can come in anytime! 
OK, I'm coming in. 
We can catch up later. Can I help you with anything, Chief? 
Umm… 
How are the Koubu? <br> I wanted to see you, Kohran. 
How are the Koubu? Did you come up with a way to repair them? 
Well, to be honest… I haven't even touched the Kobu. 
What!? But how will we be able to fight the Koma? 
No matter how much we trained, fighting them without our Spirit Armours would be madness! 
…I'm not allowed to tell you anything about that. 
I see… 
I'm sorry, Chief. That's the only explanation I can give you… 
Since you're finally back, let's do something fun! …Wanna play Hanafuda? 
Kohran… You sound very optimistic. 
Yeah! I'm in a good mood because I've just completed the assignment old man Yoneda gave me! 
An assignment… from Yoneda? 
Oh, shoot! That was supposed to be a secret! 
…? 
It's… It's nothing. Back to work! 
I wanted to see you, Kohran. After all, we've been apart for three weeks. 
Yep… I also really wanted to see you, Chief. 
And… to be honest, I was a little afraid. 
…Afraid? 
Yeah… If those demons attacked while you were still gone… 
We'd have been helpless. That's a scary thought! 
…I'm sorry I had you worried, Kohran. 
Nah, it's all good! You're back safe and sound, that's all that counts! 
And just when I finished the assignment from old man Yoneda. Perfect timing! 
An assignment… from Yoneda? 
Oh, shoot! That was supposed to be a secret! 
…? 
It's… It's nothing. Back to work! 
Did you see Iris and Sumire yet? If not, you should go say hello. 
…OK, you're right. 
I should get going then… I have to say hello to everyone. 
Well… 
Leave the room. <br> Talk to Kohran. 
See you later, Kohran. 
I'm glad you stopped by, Chief. 
Hang in there! 
Please do your best, Kohran. You're the only one we can rely on regarding the Spirit Armor. 
Hang in there! 
Yeah… 
… 
…What's wrong, Kohran? 
I… I have a dream, you know… 
That sounds more grandiose than it is… I just… I wanna fly in the sky. 
But you can take a ride on the Soaring Whale whenever you want, can't you? 
That's floating, not flying! I wanna fly on the wings of freedom! 
Do you know what kind of scrap those are, the airplanes we have now? 
I've seen a few of the Navy's airplanes… 
Yep, exactly! 
Just crash after crash after crash! 
Their design, their engines… Nothing works like it should! 
Yeah, but with the technology used in our Spirit Armors… 
It would be possible to fly all the way to China. 
But… I knew someone. Someone who trusted his life to one of those scrap planes… 
When I was little, he… he said he'd fly to Japan in a plane he'd made himself. 
Hehe… And then he just flew away. 
I couldn't say anything. And of course he'd never made any promises. 
I don't know what happened after. 
If I could just fly and go after him… 
That's what I've been thinking ever since then. 
…I see. 
To develop better planes? <br> So you loved him… 
So you want to help develop better planes. 
Wha…? 
It's your dream, right? You have to build planes. For your sake, and for his… 
… 
I'm right, aren't I? 
Yeah… 
If I can lend a hand, you can give me a shout anytime. 
There's one thing I wanted to ask you, Chief… 
What is it? 
When my airplane is complete… Would you fly with me? 
Of course… I'd be happy to! 
…Thanks, Chief. 
See you around, Kohran. 
So you loved him… 
Wha…? Me? 
I… No! Or… maybe… I did? 
Could you, maybe… leave me alone for a bit? 
I wanna think about it. Please… 
…All right. 
Kohran… 
I'm sorry, Chief. Didn't wanna bore you with my old stories… 
No, not at all. 
Could you, maybe… leave me alone for a bit? 
I wanna think about it. Please… 
…All right. 
Chief…? 
What? 
I forgot to tell you one thing, Chief… 
…? 
He was… well, he was a lot like you. 
Kohran… 
See you later, Chief. 
It's Ogami… 
Come in, it's open! 
What's up, Chief? Did you say hello to everyone yet? 
Uh, yeah… 
We already spoke earlier, so why don't you go see the others? 
…All right. I'll leave you to it. 
Sumire… 
Why, Ensign. It's been a while since I had the pleasure. 
How did you spend these past three weeks? 
Hohohoho, I went to town! I treated myself to a dress, jewelry, perfume… and some really nice dinners! 
Heh… To polish my beauty to a sheen, that's MY special training. 
You're unbelievable! <br> I don't know what to say… <br> It looks like you succeeded. 
You're unbelievable! What good's that gonna do for protecting the capital? 
What do you mean? 
Sakura and the others steeled themselves in arduous training… 
And you!? What have you achieved during that time? 
I only did what I'm good at! 
Anyway, what is it to you? 
Oh boy… 
Why do you make that kind of face? 
I don't even know what to say… 
I beg your pardon? 
So… you were just going out and having fun all these weeks? 
Well, you don't even know how I feel. 
Well… It looks like you succeeded. 
… 
…? 
You say exactly the same things as the other gentlemen. 
…Huh? 
No… it's nothing. If you'll excuse me now… 
Sumire… What's the matter? 
… 
Ensign… I know it all too well… 
I know what you're thinking. 
"We trained by the sweat of our brow, and what have you been doing?" 
… 
I just did what I'm good at. 
…What do you mean? 
It's nothing… Please excuse me. 
Captain? What are you doing here of all places? 
I could ask you the same thing… You just got back, and you're already in the library. 
It feels like forever ago… Even though it's only been three weeks. 
I was just running around without ever taking a rest. 
I understand… I'm the same, really. 
Hehe, I thought you'd be. Well, I'm off. Excuse me. 
I've been away for a while, so I want to walk around the theater some more. 
Maria was right here earlier… 
Now it's deserted. I should go somewhere else. 
Oh, Ogami. It's good to see you again. So you're back from your special training? 
Yes, we just returned. Tell me, Kasumi… What exactly are you doing here? 
This underground hangar is off limits for the time being. 
I'm posted here so no one wanders in by accident. 
Off limits? That's… why!? 
I'm sorry, but I can't answer that. 
I can just tell you that entry is not permitted at the moment, even for you. 
Ogami, the hangar is off limits, so please refrain from entering. 
What's going on in there? I'd sure like to know… 
I'm sorry, but I can't answer that. 
Listen, Ogami… 
Hey, Yuri! What are you doing here? 
Listen, Ogami… You shouldn't be too hard on Sumire. 
Huh? 
I saw her. She was working very hard all day, every day. 
She sweet-talked everyone and their Frère in this city in order to raise funds for developing new weapons. 
What!? 
Parties in the financial world at night, government offices during the day… 
She can't have gotten much sleep lately. 
She isn't on too friendly terms with her family. 
She was almost cast out before she joined the Flower Division… 
But even though, now she went home to make amends. 
To raise money from the Kanzaki conglomerate and others. 
So that's what she was doing… 
And she was successful. 
It was only thanks to her that the Flower Mansion could restart their weapon development program. 
And on top of that, someone had to take care of the Imperial Theater while you were all gone, right? 
… 
Sumire, she… can be a little difficult sometimes… 
I'm sure she just didn't want you to worry about her. 
Really? 
It's not like I want you to give her a free pass for anything. 
But, if you really care about her, Ogami… 
Then you should always remember that there's a reason for her to behave like she does. 
Sumire… 
I hope Sumire is in her room… 
Sumire said she'd take a nap. 
Guess I'll head somewhere else. 
Sumire said she'd take a nap. I shouldn't disturb her now. 
…Sumire isn't here. I wonder where she went. 
It's me, Ogami… Are you there, Sumire? 
Oh, Ensign… Can I help you with anything? 
I wanted to talk to you. Could you please let me in? 
Please do. The door is open. 
If it's a lecture you want to give me, you can keep it to yourself though. 
No… It's not that… I came here to apologize. 
…Huh? 
I heard about what you did while I wasn't here… How hard you worked to raise money… 
… 
I haven't the faintest idea what you are referring to. 
I don't know who told you that, but I just went out to have fun, nothing else. 
And thanks to that, I'm pretty tired right now. I was just about to lie down for a minute. 
Sumire… 
You needn't worry about me. Go see Iris and Kohran instead. 
They have been pining for your return… 
…OK. Thank you, Sumire. 
Ayame's room. I haven't been her in some time… 
I should go somewhere else. 
She doesn't seem to be here. I wonder where she could have gone. 
It's me, Ogami. Are you there, Ayame? 
Ogami? Please, come in. 
Excuse me. 
I suppose you're here for a strategy review? 
But to be honest, there's not much to talk about regarding the battle at Meiji Shrine. 
…I'm sorry. 
Don't blame yourself. You were up against Koma, after all! 
You can't imagine how much we struggled in the Kouma War six years ago… 
… 
I'm sorry, but I can't give you any advice this time. 
I understand. Please excuse me. 
Ogami… I'm happy you come see me so often… 
But did you already talk to the rest of the Flower Division? 
Erm, I… 
Everyone was looking forward to seeing you again. 
Please go see them, why don't you. 
…Understood. 
Hey, Maria. What's going on? 
Looking at Tokyo like this sure brings back memories… I got lost in thought. 
You're right… It's been three weeks. 
…Yes. 
Well, I'll leave you to it… Please excuse me. 
…Maria is gone, so I should leave too. 
OK, I should probably report to Manager Yoneda that I'm back from my special training. 
Yoneda… He's probably asleep. 
…Let's go to another room. I should check up on everyone from the Flower Division. 
Zzzzz… Zzzzz… 
It's no use. He must already be sleeping. 
Ichiro Ogami, reporting back! 
Oh, Ogami! Come in, come in! 
Yessir! 
It's good to see you again, sir! I have returned from my special training! 
Oh… Your face looks a little more slim. Not bad, not bad. 
Sir… 
What about the Kobu? <br> How are the girls doing? <br> Any news about the Koma? 
What about the Kobu? 
The Kobu…? I told you I'd take care of that, didn't I? 
That's true, but… 
Do you think I just sat on my butt these past three weeks? Don't worry! 
How are the girls doing? 
Oh… Looks like you really worry about your squad mates. 
Especially… Sakura, right? 
Especially… Sumire, right? 
Maria accompanied you, so… You got lucky? 
Especially… Kanna, right? 
Especially… Iris, right? 
Especially… Kohran, right? 
S-Sir! Please don't make fun of me! 
Any news about the Koma? 
Luckily, they haven't shown their faces here recently. 
I bet they're taking an extended New Year's vacation. Wahahahaha! 
Let's pray it stays that way. 
Hey, Ogami! Even though your special training is done, you shouldn't go back to spacing out! 
Even the most intense training is different from the real deal. You have to give it your all from now on! 
Y-yessir. 
But the most important thing is to have you back safe and sound. Say hello to everyone, will you? 
I'll take a quick afternoon nap, so don't come back and wake me up! 
Understood. See you later. 
Whoa… Kanna can still eat like a horse. 
You seem to be enjoying your food. 
No matter what anyone says, eating good is the best way to grow strong. 
Not being fussy and just gobbling up everything… It sounds easy, but it's the hardest training there is. 
Is there anything you really like or dislike? 
Nah, I'll eat anything. <br> There are some I don't like… <br> I like masculine women. 
Nah, I'll eat anything. Even as a child, I wasn't fussy about food. 
Wow, you can be proud of that! If you're gonna eat something, might as well enjoy it. 
To be honest, there are some things I don't like… 
Wow, I wouldn't have thought there was something like that. 
But… to be honest, what happened at Fukagawa really changed the way I feel. 
Everyone has their weaknesses, don't you think? 
Thanks to you, I've come to accept that fact. 
Well, I… I really like masculine women. 
Oh, shut up, you! I'm talking about food, of course. 
… 
But… Is it really true that you like masculine women? 
Did I really just say that? 
I, er… No, forget about it. Back to eating! 
Haha… Your silence speaks volumes. There really is something you don't like at all, huh? 
If you wanna grow big and strong, you mustn't be picky. But of course I won't force you. 
What a great meal! 
When I eat the food here, it really feels like I'm finally home again. 
See you around, Boss. 
OK… I have to get going. 
Hey, Tsubaki… 
Welcome, Ogami! 
I'm super busy organizing the posters and stuff. Would you mind coming back later? 
Oh… See you later, then. 
Hey, Tsubaki. Long time no see! 
Welcome back, Ogami! I hope you had a productive special training! 
So you have to work, even when there aren't any shows? 
Yes! I'm super busy organizing all the posters and portrait cards! 
Because I'm sorting through the portrait cards right now, I can't sell any right now, unfortunately. 
Oh? That's too bad. 
Oh, wait! We've got some special portrait cards that we only sell around New Year's day! 
You can choose one you like for free. 
Really? Are you sure? 
Yes, because you're always buying so many portrait cards. 
We've got 7 different ones in stock. Whose portrait would you like? 
Sakura's please! <br> Sumire's please! <br> Maria's please! 
Iris' please! <br> Kanna's please! <br> Kohran's please! 
Sakura's special portrait card? Here you go! 
Sumire's special portrait card? Here you go! 
Maria's special portrait card? Here you go! 
Iris' special portrait card? Here you go! 
Kanna's special portrait card? Here you go! 
Kohran's special portrait card? Here you go! 
…OK, just for you, I have an extra-special, secret portrait card here! 
Ta-daaa! It's a portrait of… Ayame! 
Wh-what's this… Why do you have portrait card of Ayame!? 
It's normally not for sale. It's very valuable, so take good care of it! 
I hope you'll continue to buy lots of portrait cards this year! 
I've got a different portrait card each month, so you should check back regularly! 
Oh? Sakura… 
Ah… Ogami. 
You're practicing all alone? 
No… I'm not here to practice… 
I just wanted to look at the stage, after I've been away for so long. 
And when I was standing here… my body just started dancing by itself. 
Really like the stage, huh? <br> Hope the shows start soon. 
You really like the stage, huh? 
Yes… I was so nervous when I came here last April… 
But now, I always enjoy standing on the stage. 
To dance after so long… It puts my mind at ease. 
… 
I hope the shows can start up again soon. 
Yes. After all, performing on stage is part of the job description. 
But during my sword training, I haven't practiced dancing at all… 
When the shows start again, I'll have to do a different kind of special training, hehehe.. 
…Come on, say something. Or do you just think I'm weird? 
Oh, sorry… I didn't think that at all… 
Maybe you can't imagine how it is, but my body started moving by itself. 
OK, Ogami… If you'll excuse me… 
Yeah. See you later! 
OK, I should get going, too. 
Hey, Boss! 
Looks like you're hard at work, Kanna! Back to training already? 
Well, if our last battle taught us one thing, it's to never let our guard down, right? 
…That's true. 
Come to think of it… We didn't have time to talk like this since the New Year's shrine visit. 
You know what, you're right. 
That was so nice… Going to the shrine just with you… 
I'm happy you see it that way, too. 
B-by the way, was the special training successful? 
Hey, Boss! 
Looks like you're hard at work, Kanna! Back to training already? 
Well, if our last battle taught us one thing, it's to never let our guard down, right? 
…That's true. 
Earlier… You said you wrestled with a bull. Are you sure, it was… I mean, a BULL!? 
Come on, why should I lie about something like that? 
I'm pretty sure it wasn't a bunny rabbit. He almost killed me… Yeah, he was definitely pretty strong. 
Wow… Not bad, Kanna… 
My father would have laughed at something like that… He once wrestled a bear! 
A… A bear? That's unbelievable… 
By the way, how did your special training go? 
Just great! <br> So-so… <br> It was a catastrophe. 
Just great! 
Sounds good! 
I'm counting on you, Boss! 
So-so, I'd say… 
Oh, really? Well, better to have middling results than none at all. 
It was a catastrophe. 
Wha-wha-what?! What were you doing? 
But don't worry, Boss! I can make up for a hundred others! 
Hahaha… 
…? 
…I can't really tell if it was effective or not. 
What, really? What have you been doing all those weeks? 
Well, all sorts of things… 
OK then… Let's give it our best, Boss. 
Yes, let's do that! 
But… I really wish I could handle guns… Then I could have been the one to go with you… 
… huh? 
Ah, no… It's nothing! I… I'll be going now. 
OK. See you later, Kanna! 
B-Boss… 
Hm? What is it, Kanna? 
You… You were all alone with Maria for several weeks, right? 
Yeah, because we were always together there at the training camp. 
During that time, did you… er… 
…Sorry! It's nothing. See you later! 
Kanna… What was she trying to say? 
…By the way, were you together with Maria the whole time? 
Yeah, because we were always together there at the Navy training camp. 
I see… 
…What's up, Kanna? 
No, it's nothing. I have to get going… 
OK, see you later. 
… 
I hope you take good care of Maria! She… She really needs a man she can rely on! 
Huh? Hey, hold on… 
Well, I have to get going. See you, Boss. 
OK, see you later. 
Huh… Isn't the shower running? …There's an open locker… 
…! 
…Those are Sakura's clothes in the locker… That means… 
What is this sudden dizzy feeling? You better keep it together, Ogami! 
Leave right now! <br> I'm drawn towards the showers… 
That would be taking things a little too far, I guess. Better leave right now. 
Oh boy… Good thing I'm so level-headed. 
C-crap… I can't decide what to do! 
…Huh? Is someone there? 
I'm dead! I need to get out of here! 
Phew… I managed to escape before she noticed. 
It's no use. It's like some strange force is pulling me towards the showers… 
(Sa… Sakura's taking a shower…) 
Lalala~… Whaaaat is the puurrrpose of our lives… 
(Sakura…) 
Phew… Guess it's time to finish. 
(I'm done for! I need to run!) 
Phew… I managed to escape before she noticed. 
Man, seeing Sakura taking a shower… I have a feeling this is going to be an awesome year! 
Oh, Ogami! What are you doing here? 
Whoa! You're… You're already finished? 
Yes! It feels like washing all the exhaustion from my special training away! 
But… How did you know I was taking a shower? 
Well, it's just… I heard the shower, so… 
You didn't peek, did you? 
Eeeek! Wh-what… 
Hehehe, just kidding. I'm off, see you later. 
Phew… I almost had a heart attack.
