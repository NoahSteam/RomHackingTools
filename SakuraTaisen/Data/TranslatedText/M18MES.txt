﻿﻿﻿Boar!
Deer!
Butterfly!
Finally we have been revived! The Three Knights of Twilight!
Dad… Captain Ogami… Give me strength, just once… just one last time…
Wind, untamed king of the sky…
Let my life be your sustenance! Howl! Rage! Dance through the skies, run across the heavens!
Uoooooooh! This is the end!
Let me show you the ultimate Kirishima technique… Quadrant Strike!
Father… Captain Ogami… Give me strength, just once… just one last time…
Secret of the sword… Soha shunsoku… Spirit power in unison! Strike our foes with the mind's eye!
Floral Splendor!
*sniff* Kanna…
Kanna!
S-So selfish until the end… So… So unrefined, and…
Sakura!
Boohoohooo… Sakura…
…
S-Sakura… ya can't do that to me!
S-So selfish until the end… You're so… so unrefined… my dear… Sakura.
Good riddance, maggot!
Guaaaaaaah!
L-Let go! If we fall, we'll both die!
What… is that…?
To die while smashing a maggot… I don't deserve this…
Ensign… All of you… I'll leave the curtain call to you…
Don't underestimate me!
I don't care!
Ogami… Goodbye…
Sumire…
Uh… Uuuuuh…
Sumire! Who will I argue with when you're gone…?!
Sakura! Don't you dare deprive me of our bickering!
You idiot… A spoiled brat who wanted to play the heroine…
Waaaaaaaaaah!
What, that's all ya got?!
My place in life! My future! My dreams!
Don't mess with the Imperial Assault Troupe, Flower Division!
Science saves the day!
Aaaah!
My place in life! My future! My dreams!
Ogami… Goodbye…
I… don't want this…
Kohran! Kohraaaaan!!
Sakura…
Kohran…
Kohran… You can't leave me too…
I… won't… lose… No, I won't!
Mon Frère… I'll protect you, I promise!!
Let go! If you kill me, I'll explode!
Thanks, Iris…
Thanks, Iris…
I… won't… lose… No, I won't!
Ogami… I'll protect you… whatever happens!
Thanks, Sakura…
All of you…
All of you…
All of you…
All of you…
All of you…
All of you…
It's time now… We'll break into the Sacred Demon Castle and destroy the Spirit Cannon.
And then we'll defeat Satan and save Ayame!
I'm trembling like a samurai before battle!
This will be Sumire Kanzaki's greatest show ever.
Let's give it our all!
I'll do my best!
We've got to protect the capital… and the world!
Let's go, everyone!
Roger!!
This is it. We don't know what's waiting for us inside. Let's heal up now, while we still can.
Everyone who had to withdraw should begin repairs immediately!
Ensign, I can feel a strong energy building up.
Is there a switch to open this door? Ah, there.
What's this?!
The Three Knights of Twilight?
Aren't you… supposed to be dead?
We meet again…
You fools, who dare defy Lord Satan!
Prepare to accept our judgment!
What… What are they?
Careful! They look more determined than before!
You gotta be kidding me with that "Three Knights" crap!
You go ahead, Boss. I'll hold them off!
Wh-What?! No! I can't leave you behind on your own!
Remember why we're here!
Save Ayame, defeat Satan, save the world… right?!
So don't get all squeamish now, you softie!
Kanna…
Kanna is right. Let's hurry, sir!
Maria?!
Get a move on!
All right… We'll be back soon, so hold out until then, Kanna!
Roger!
I'm really clumsy… Could have chosen something more dramatic for my last words…
Come on then! I'll take you on all at once!
Bah! Facing us all alone… I almost pity your stupidity.
In Kirishima-style Karate, it's strictly forbidden to turn your back on the enemy!
I'll play along.
I can't allow you to get through here!
So weak… You're no match for me!
Now I'll snap your little neck.
Ugh… Haaa…
You can do this without me.
Sakura… I'll protect you, I swear!
Sumire… I'll always protect you!
Maria… I've got your back.
I'll always protect you, Iris!
I'll protect you, Kohran! Don't you worry!
Kanna! Leave the defense to me!
There's a switch!
Careful! They look more determined than before!
What's that "Three Knights" nonsense? Do you think we're children?
Please go ahead, Ogami. I'll hold them back!
Our goal is destroying the Spirit Cannon! There's no time! Go, now!
Sakura…
Kanna is right. Let's hurry, sir!
All right… We'll be back soon, so hold out until then, Sakura!
Roger!
How clumsy of me… My last conversation with Ogami, and that's all I can think of…
Come on then! I'll fight every one of you at once!
It's a Shinguji family tradition never to retreat!
No one of you will take a single step beyond this point!
Ugh… Haaa…
Do your best, Ogami… You're the only ones who can save the capital!
I need to focus!
I'm moving out!
Leave it to me!!
Watch this, Ogami.
I-I'm OK…
Thank you!
Get them, Ogami!
I'm counting on you, Ogami!
Kyaaa!
Y-You've not seen the last of me!
Ogami… I'm sorry…
It's my turn now.
Hahahaha…
I'm moving out!!
Today's performance is just for you!
It'll take more than that to bring me down…
Ensign… so you really do care…
Now, Ensign, make your move!
I'll be keeping my eyes on you!
Uwahhh!!
I suppose I'll let you win for now!
The captain needs me!!
I'll have to take down the enemies myself!
Where's my next target!?
Whoever wants to die first, just step forward…
I'll be relying on your orders, sir!
I'm not finished yet!! Not yet!!
You're doing that… just for me?
Focus, sir!
We'll make it out of this alive!
Ahhh…
They're too strong!! I need to withdraw!!
Forgive me, sir. I need to withdraw!
I can fight too!
Here I go!
I'm super strong!
I'll fight hard for you, Mon Frère!!
Uh, some of these lights are flashing…
You're the best, Mon Frère!
Go get 'em, Mon Frère!
I'll be watching!
Kyaaaa…
Stupid… stars…
Sorry, Mon Frère!
Gonna go all out.
Better not underestimate science~.
Movin' out!!
Check this out!
I'm takin' too much damage here!
Aww, you're the best!
I'm rootin' for ya!
Take 'em down, chief!
Uwahhh…
Dangit… they got me…
Sorry, chief…
All right! Let's do this!!
Full power! Hiyaaaaa!
Feast your eyes on the killer techniques of the Kirishima!
Let's take 'em down, Boss!!
No problem! It's just a scratch!!
Thanks! I owe you one!
Get in there, Boss!
Let's see what you can do!
Uwahhh…
Damn. Guess I still haven't trained enough…
I've gotta keep fighting… for the Boss.
All right!
We did it!
We did it!
Phew!
Nice one!
Woo! We did it!!
