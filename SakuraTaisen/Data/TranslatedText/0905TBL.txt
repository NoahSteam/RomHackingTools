﻿It's a photo of Sakura. She's looking right at me. I wonder what she's thinking… 
It's a photo of Sumire. This is a side of her you don't see too often. 
It's a photo of Maria. …She's lost in thought and looks kind of sad… 
It's a photo of Kanna. Kanna's signature strength comes through clearly. 
It's a photo of Iris. She's surrounded by flowers and flashing a radiant smile. 
It's a photo of Kohran. She's looking pretty in profile with her face dyed red by the evening sun. 
A letter given to me by a patron. I was asked to give it to Sumire. I have a bad feeling about this… 
Maria's pistol. This may help me escape from here… 
A hair ornament. It's decorated with flowers and looks very elegant. 
A brooch. It's a beautiful piece of delicate craftsmanship. 
A hairpin for use in a traditional bun hairstyle. It would complement a formal outfit well. 
Jean-Paul the teddy bear. Iris's best friend. She always carries him with her and takes good care of him. 
This key will let me enter rooms I couldn't before. 
I found this in a bedroom on the second floor. I can use it to access the back room. 
A teacup Iris asked me to get for her. It has a very stylish design. 
This is the matchbox Iris asked for. Its logo is quite colorful. 
A knife Iris asked me to get for her. Just a normal utensil you'd use during a meal. 
A prop sword and shield used onstage. They're well-made and look just like the real thing. 
A prop crown used onstage. It's well-constructed and incredibly detailed. 
A wig and costume used onstage. I wonder what kind of act could use a flashy outfit like this? 
It's a photo of Sakura in her swimsuit. Wow, this is really something. I'm gonna treasure this. 
It's a photo of Sumire in her stage costume. Her distinctive makeup really makes an impact. 
It's a photo of Maria on stage in the military uniform from "For Love"… She's a beautiful woman disguised as a man. 
It's a photo of Kanna in her training gear. Catching her in a private moment like this feels surprisingly intimate. 
It's a photo of Iris in her swimsuit. She's holding a rubber ring and looks ready to have some fun. How cute. 
It's a photo of Kohran. I don't get to see her with her braids undone very often. It's a nice look. 
It's a photo of Ayame in a traditional outfit. I hope she'll always be as happy and content as she is here. 
Ayame's gun. Why…? Why did it have to turn out like this…? 
Waaaaaugh! 
W-what was that just now?! 
Hahaha, are you sure you can afford to be distracted? 
…Ayame. Do you still not recognize me?! It's me, Ogami! 
Hahaha…I know who you are, Ichiro Ogami. 
I'm the same person I always was… 
I am Kouma Aya-me, the strongest and most trusted of Satan's followers. 
You're under their control! Please try to break free! Ayame?! 
Your beloved Ayame Fujieda is no more. If you're so eager to see her again… 
You'll have to try the next world. 
Ayame! Wake up! 
Ayame! Open your eyes! 
Ayame! Please come back to us! 
Ayame! Snap out of it! 
Auntie Aya! You've gotta wake up! 
Ayame! Come on, you can beat this! 
Hmhmhm! How desperate you are. Such a sweet girl. 
Now it's time for you to die. 
Aya-me, Seima Castle has been restored. Return at once… 
Yes, master! 
…This is your lucky day. 
Ohoho…Let's save the real fun for next time. 
Hehe, listen, boy…If you want to find me, then come to Tokyo Bay. 
Ayameeee! 
Aah… 
Ayame… 
T-that's Seima Castle…? It's…it's a whole city!

Captain! We have no time to lose! Let's dispatch to Tokyo Bay immediately! 
Check it out, the fog has cleared up. It'll be morning soon…There's no such thing as a night that lasts forever! 
Yeah! Just look at that!! 
W-what the heck?! 
Aah…aaah!! 
Guaaah! T-that's… 
Seima Castle… 
Behold! Here lies Yamato, the phantom realm that was erased from history! 
You are too late to thwart my ambitions. I am the true ruler! Satan, Lord of Heaven! 
Degeneration, anger, despair! Come to me now… 
The new capital shall be here in Yamato! 
Mmhmhmhmm… Hm… Hahaha…Aaaahahahahahaha…!!
