It's a photo of Sakura. She's looking right at me. I wonder what she's thinking...
It's a photo of Sumire. This is a side of her you don't see too often.
It's a photo of Maria. ...She's lost in thought and looks kind of sad...
A photo of Kanna. Kanna's signature strength comes through clearly. 
A photo of Iris. She's surrounded by flowers and flashing a radiant smile.
A photo of Kohran. She's looking pretty in profile with her face dyed red by the evening sun.
A letter given to me by a patron. I was asked to give it to Sumire. I have a bad feeling about this...
Maria's pistol. This may help me escape from here...
A hair ornament. It's decorated with flowers and looks very elegant.
A brooch. It's a beautiful piece of delicate craftsmanship.
A hairpin for use in a traditional bun hairstyle. It would complement a formal outfit well.
Jean-Paul the teddy bear. Iris's best friend. She always carries him with her and takes good care of him.
This key will let me enter rooms I couldn't before.
I found this in a bedroom on the second floor. I can use it to access the back room.
A teacup Iris asked me to get for her. It has a very stylish design.
This is the matchbox Iris asked for. Its logo is quite colorful.
A knife Iris asked me to get for her. Just a normal utensil you'd use during a meal.
A prop sword and shield used onstage. They're well-made and look just like the real thing.
A prop crown used onstage. It's well-constructed and incredibly detailed.
A wig and costume used onstage. I wonder what kind of act could use a flashy outfit like this?
A photo of Sakura in her swimsuit. Wow, this is really something. I'm gonna treasure this.
A photo of Sumire in her stage costume. Her distinctive makeup really makes an impact.
It's a photo of Maria on stage in the military uniform from "For Love"... She's a beautiful woman disguised as a man. 
A photo of Kanna in her training gear. Catching her in a private moment like this feels surprisingly intimate.
A photo of Iris in her swimsuit. She's holding a rubber ring and looks ready to have some fun. How cute.
A photo of Kohran. I don't get to see her with her braids undone very often. It's a nice look.
A photo of Ayame in a traditional outfit. I hope she'll always be as happy and content as she is here.
Ayame's gun. Why...? Why did it have to turn out like this...?
Waaaaaugh!
W-what was that just now?!
Hahaha, are you sure you can afford to be distracted?
...Ayame. Do you still not recognize me?! It's me, Ogami!
Hahaha..I know who you are, Ichiro Ogami.
I'm the same person I always was...
I am Kouma Aya-me, the strongest and most trusted of Satan's followers.
You're under their control! Please try to break free! Ayame?!
Your beloved Ayame Fujieda is no more. If you're so eager to see her again...
You'll have to try the next world.
Ayame! Wake up!
Ayame! Open your eyes!
Ayame! Please come back to us!
Ayame! Snap out of it!
Auntie Aya! You've gotta wake up!
Ayame! Come on, you can beat this!
Huhuhu! How desperate you are. Such a sweet girl.
Now it's time for you to die.
Aya-me, Seima Castle has been restored. Return at once...
Yes, master!
...This is your lucky day.
Ohoho...Let's save the real fun for next time.
Huhu, listen, boy...If you want to find me, then come to Tokyo Bay.
Ayameeee!
Aah...
Ayame...
T-that's Seima Castle...? It's...it's a whole city!
Lord Satan! I have gathered the elite of the Koma!
The time has come for you to roam the surface!
Destroy! Annihilate! Extinguish everything! Ah, how beautiful it will be!
And after everything is dead and gone, new life will be born!
Destruction is only the prelude to new life!
On the night of the crimson moon, the strongest of all Koma will be born again...
And they will join us in our extasy of extermination!
Koma "Deer"!
Yes, master!
You will buy us the time we need.
As you command.
And don't do anything stupid, like seeking revenge for "Boar"!
Yes...
I will prove to you that I am the strongest of all, Lord Satan...
That man... Aoi Satan... Maybe his true goal is the Pandemonium Insignia.
The Pandemonium Insignia are the key to the gates of the Sacred Demon Castle.
They're in our possession right now.
No one except me and Ayame can open this vault.
That's why we can expect him to attack us! So be ready!
It's a castle that was built hundreds of years ago to bring death and destruction to the world.
We can't allow it to appear on the face of the earth!
Even among the military, this is highly classified information. Don't talk to anyone about it.
The treasure is almost in our grasp!
Be careful, this place is riddled with traps! Take each step exactly like I'll show you!
Yes, OK.
First three steps to the left, then four to the right and seven straight ahead...
...Is a path you absolutely shouldn't take.
Hihihi... Just a little bit farther.
Koma "Deer"... Are you there?
Yes, master!
Attack! Keep those pesky girls busy until the strongest of all Koma arrives!
Keep them busy... Yes, consider it done!
Hihihi... Humans! Your days in this world are counted!
The crimson moon... then darkness... and destruction...
How fitting as a prelude to a new world.
Hmph! Bunch of worthless worms...
I suppose it is time to awaken him...

Ayame!

Hihihi...
That's...
Waah!
A-Ayame...
Hihi... Muahaha... Time to hand over the Pandemonium Vessel...
The Pandemonium Vessel!
Come, Ayame... Come to me!
Y-yes...
Ogami! Please... You have to shoot me!
Please, shoot me now! This is an order, Ogami!
Mr. Ogami... Don't shoot!
Please be yourself... The real Ogami.
Ogami...
Ogami...
Hihihi... How ironic that the seal cast upon me would also be the strongest of all...
Remember, Ayame... Remember the lost paradise...
Ogami!
Ayame!
Whatcha doing?!
It's... all... right... Ogami.
Hihihihi... Ichiro Ogami. Your calm judgment, your quick actions, your courage... All worthy of praise.
But all that will be in vain... It will be my greatest pleasure to pluck the seed of hope from your dirt...
Foolish humans! I hope you enjoy the bitter taste of despair!
Behold... this!
Hihihi... This is the strongest of all Koma, the one closest to me... And his helper...
The murderess has awakened!
Yes... the two of us are one. Our vow from the last life will finally be fulfilled...
Hi...
Tonight's fated meeting... We will conquer everything and create a demonic paradise...
Hihihi...
And this is the key we sought. Please accept the Pandemonium Vessel.
Aaaah!!
Muahaha... Only pain and desperation await you...
Come... sweet ruin...
The Ayame you knew is already dead.
She died by that gun you're holding right now. Aaaahahahaha!
Your precious Ayame is gone... Along with the crimson moon!
Untranslated
At last, it will return to this world... the Sacred Demon Castle!
Hahaha!
Commander...
You think I'm depressed!? Ha! Ridiculous!
What do I care if one or two women like that die?
Huh...
Difficult?! You talk just like them, commander!
Hmph!
Untranslated
I'll be going!
How... How could you say something like that!?
You... who knows us better than anyone else!
Every day we must fight! Kill, kill, kill!
Untranslated
Untranslated
Who made me what I am? Wasn't it Ms. Ayame!? Certainly not you lot!
But even though... She just double-crossed us...
Untranslated
Call me childish, but I can't see any good in Ms. Ayame even if I tried.
!
I'm sorry... commander... Please leave me be... for a second...
Auntie Ayame...n
I've calmed down a bit...
Untranslated
Untranslated
Mr. Ogami... You liked Ms. Ayame, right?
But... It didn't look like that to me.
As for me... I liked her a lot. I always strove to become a person just like her.
Untranslated
Sorry... I'm sure I don't make sense...
Untranslated
That's it! Ms. Ayame must simply be under Satan's control!
We have to save her! The Imperial Floral Storm Troop wouldn't be the same without her!
Thank you, Mr. Ogami.
I... I liked her a lot, too. She was a big inspiration.
I could only dream of becoming like her one day...
But everything's changed now! I've grown a lot stronger since then.
Come on, Mr. Ogami! Let's save Ms. Ayame!
Untranslated
Muahahaha... The castle that will fulfill all my ambitions is about to return. Murderess!
Yes.
Untranslated
Yes, master!
Show me what you can do.
Please wait.
Untranslated
Untranslated
Hmph... Very well. As you please...
Untranslated
Hahaha!
Why are you laughing?
Untranslated
I will fulfill my ambition together with Lord Satan... I won't allow you to interfere!
Captain! We have no time to lose! Let's dispatch to Tokyo Bay immediately!
Check it out, the fog has cleared up. It'll be morning soon...There's no such thing as a night that lasts forever!
Yeah! Just look at that!!
W-what the heck?!
Aah...aaah!!
Guaaah! T-that's...
Seima Castle...
Behold! Here lies Yamato, the phantom realm that was erased from history!
You are too late to thwart my ambitions. I am the true ruler! Satan, Lord of Heaven!
Degeneration, anger, despair! Come to me now...
The new capital shall be here in Yamato!
Huhuhuhu...Hu...Hahaha...Aaaahahahahahaha...
Untranslated
Untranslated
Why? Why you, Ms. Ayame... After we've fought together, side by side!
We can't throw in the towel just yet. This fight is only just beginning!
But... What are you saying!? This isn't like you at all, Mr. Ogami!
Untranslated
Please cheer up!
Untranslated
Hm? Lieutenant...?
Untranslated
Untranslated
If I'd just been stronger, then... All of this wouldn't have happened.
Untranslated
You can stop trying to make me feel better, commander. I've failed, that's a fact.
Untranslated
So... What are you saying?
Untranslated
I'm pretty sure you'll grow tired of being around me soon enough...
Huh?
Cut it out... This isn't like you.
Aah...
Yes... I guess you're right...
Commander...
Thank you.
Having someone to lean on at a time like this... That's priceless.
Untranslated
Ms. Ayame... that such a thing could happen to her...
Untranslated
There's no one there...
Sakura... Kasumi...
Everyone's gone. Just like auntie Ayame... Everyone...
Uncle Ichi... You won't leave me, right? Promise you'll never leave me!
I don't want to be alone! I would die!
Uncle Ichi...
I just... I don't want to be alone...
Untranslated
That you'll always... be there?
Untranslated
You know me... I can't do anything right.
I can't shoot a gun like Maria, and I'm not strong like Kanna.
*sniff* The only thing I'm even remotely good is tinkering with stuff.
Untranslated
Untranslated
Untranslated
Untranslated
Can you tell me that, boss?
*sniff* Really?
You're right... Gotta keep smiling! Nothing good's ever come of moping.
Thanks, boss. I should head back to my room and get some shut-eye.
OK, commander... Good night.
Untranslated
Untranslated
No, no... A lie is better than nothing. I really like you, boss!
OK... I should probably head back to my room.
B-boss...
It doesn't matter...
That... That'd be too much. I can't ask that of you, boss...
Untranslated
That's... Boss... So you remembered?
Ogami...
Yeah...
Ogami...
Of course... If I could fly with you, you can't imagine how much I'd...
*sniff* It's funny, really...
Just being here with you like this... I already feel so much better. I wonder why that is...
Ah... Commander...
Out of everyone in the Flower Division, I've known Ms. Ayame the longest.
I first met her four years ago in America.
Untranslated
Untranslated
Even back then, she was always fighting for others.
What a sad life...
Untranslated
Untranslated
Untranslated
No... Not at all!
Commander... No, I should say Mr. Ogami... You're always fighting for the Flower Division and the people of this city...
Untranslated
I'll fight alongside you, for this city. That's all that counts for now.
Yes, but...
Please forget what I said...
Please forget what I said...
I think I'll follow your advice... I'll rest for a bit.
Untranslated
Untranslated
Until now... No, until you were here, Mr. Ogami...
Hihi... Ms. Ayame always was the only one I could talk with about these things.
