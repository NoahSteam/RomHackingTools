...! 
...What is it, Maria? 
What's that voice!? 
Who are you! 
Damned Black Web! So we didn't get all of them...? 
What...!? 
That's...! 
What do you want from us? 
Ms. Ayame! 
Let's go, everyone! We'll show them what our Koubu can do! 
...! 
...OK. An hour has passed by now. 
Wow... Beautiful! 
Yes, of course. <br> No, I was talking about you. 
Yes, of course. That's perfect for New Year's day. 
OK, should we get going? Let's take the steam train to Meiji Shrine. 
No, I was talking about you. 
No, I really mean it... 
OK, should we get going? Let's take the steam train to Meiji Shrine. 
...? 
S-sorry. I was admiring your long-sleeved kimono... 
OK, should we get going? Let's take the steam train to Meiji Shrine. 
Hahaha... 
Oh... The steam train is arriving at exactly the right moment. 
Come, Maria. Watch your step when you get in. 
Thank you, commander. 
OK, Kohran. Slow and steady wins the race. 
Just leave it to me! I know the streets of this city like the back of my hand. We'll be at Meiji Shrine in no time! 
All right then... Should we go to Meiji Shrine for our shrine visit? 
You want to walk to the station, Iris? 
Yup! Let's go, Uncle Ichi! 
OK... How should we get to Meiji Shrine... 
Taking the steam train would be the fastest... 
Are you serious, commander?! We'll run there of course! 
What?! You want to run all the way to Meiji Shrine? 
Sure! The air is wonderful on New Year's day. It'll be a fun jog. 
Let's go! Or do you want to be left behind? 
Oh boy... This New Year is off to a good start... 
Oh, really? 
No, no... I just wouldn't have expected that. 
What I thought?! That's not... 
I just figured you'd get lots of invitations from young counts and princes. 
...? 
Oh really? ...Those circles are like a foreign world for me. 
Y-you think so? 
Dancing? I couldn't remember a single step... 
Hahaha... I'd only step on your feet and embarrass myself. 
(There are secret techniques in ballroom dancing...?!) 
You've got a deal, Sumire! 
Yeah... Just a short time ago, it seemed like the fighting would never stop. 
Whatever happened, it's over now. The world is finally at peace. 
(Back then...?) 
Er, then... Why don't you tell me how you celebrate the New Year in Russia? 
I'm sure you don't visit any shrines. So... What do you do on New Year's Eve? 
...A prayer? 
That's a custom I can really picture in cold, cold Russia. 
You know what, Maria... You really changed a lot. You never used to talk like this. 
When we first met, you used to get mad at me all the time. 
No, no. You were right. I was so green back then. 
I was barely knew what I was doing... 
Nah... But anyway, this is New Year's day, remember? Let's have some fun! 
Whoa, Kohran! Aren't we going a little too fast? 
But... I still remember what happened when we first met, and... 
Hey, hey! 
And... that's a GOOD thing? 
I think I'd like to get off now... 
...? 
Hahaha... That's certainly an honor. 
...Who are you talking about? 
Please... Be gentle! 
I'm... not sure? 
Is this better? 
OK... 
Of course not! I would never...! 
Hey, we aren't in any kind of hurry, are we? 
Like this? What do you mean? 
What!? 
Yes. 
You mean your parents back in France? 
Oh, really? What did you write about? 
...WHAT!? 
Well I suppose so, but... no... That's not even the problem! 
...Yeah, yeah. OK. 
Huff... huff... What... are you doing... this early... 
Running... from Ginza... to the Meiji Shrine... anyone would be... exhausted! 
R-really? 
So that's why you turned out so strong. 
(I don't think there are many men who're stronger than you...) 
...? 
Hahaha... No wonder this is a leisurely stroll for you. 
Heeey, Kanna! Wait up! You're too fast for me! 
Oh boy... If she's like that at the Meiji shrine, she'll probably make me swim to Okinawa... 
Yes. This is the peace all of you fought for so hard. 
Yeah. 
I don't want to lose you in the crowd, so let's hold hands. 
Isn't that why you came here? 
You're complaining, but aren't you having fun, too? 
Yeah, yeah... 
Well, it's New Year's day after all... 
...? 
You'll get used to it. Just give it time. 
And... In an atmosphere like this, everyone's enjoying themselves. 
It's OK to have feelings. 
Whoa... You can't do that in a shrine, or we'll get kicked out! 
Come on, let's just pay our respects at the shrine. 
Wait, Iris! If you run around like that, you'll hurt yourself. 
Hey! You're bumping into people! Watch where you're going! 
Waaaait! If you run off alone, you'll get lost. 
This just makes you realize how peaceful this city has become. And it's all thanks to you guys. 
Thank you... Kanna... But... 
In order to keep this peace, we'll have to work even harder. 
Yeah... Sorry.

There are lots of stalls, just like on festival days. 
Ook, ook, ook! 
Mr. Ogami... Looks like you've taken a fancy to that monkey. 
Whoa, that monkey's so cute! 
Not as cute as you. <br> Yeah, he's really cute. 
Not as cute as you, Sakura. 
Am I supposed to feel good about that comparison? 
Er... I guess that was a stupid thing to say. 
Yeah, he's really cute. And clever, too! 
That's true... 
If it wasn't for this peace, we wouldn't be able to watch something like this. 
Yes, for sure. 
Don't... don't you like monkeys? 
No, I was just... Isn't it amazing what the little fellow can do? 
Are you STILL not fed up with that monkey? Let's move on already. 
A... trained monkey? Why would you train a monkey? 
(...?) 
Haven't you seen one before? <br> Isn't it cute? 
Haven't you seen a monkey before, Sumire? 
Apart from biology books, no. 
(I guess with her upbringing, I shouldn't be surprised...) 
Well, I suppose seeing one from up close is indeed educational. 
Its behind is really very red. What a stylish little creature. 
Isn't it cute? And clever, too! 
But, alas... I've never grown accustomed to wild animals... 
I see... 
Could we go somewhere else, Lieutenant? I don't want to catch its smell. 
OK. Should we move on then? 
You really like that monkey, huh? 
Oh, how lovely! So... does it do anything? 
(I see. Maria has never seen a trained monkey before.) 
Explain about trained monkeys. <br> Tell her a fib. 
A trainer taught him all sorts of tricks, like making back-flips and climbing ladders. 
...Oh, really? That sounds amazing. 
They always have them at festivals like this, just like cork shooting ranges and stuff. 
I've learned something new today. 
Should we take a look at the other stalls too? 
...Yes, let's go. 
It's a super smart monkey who has trained a human to do little tricks for him. 
Really!? That sounds unbelievable. 
You really didn't know that? The monkey beats his drum to command his human. 
I have to see that for myself! Let's stay here and watch. 
...What? Uh, that's... 
Hey, Maria! See that over there!? Let's check it out! 
Hehehe... Okay, let's go. 
Erm... 
Don't you want to go somewhere else, Mr. Ogami? 
Y-yeah, I guess so. 
But we already saw the monkey! Let's go somewhere else. 
Hmmm, a trained monkey? It's a little different from the ones I used to watch. 
Trained monkeys in China, you mean? <br> The monkey looks just like you, Kohran! 
Trained monkeys in China, you mean? I wonder what they can do... 
You don't know them, boss? They can throw knives, or... 
K-knives!? 
Or ride on unicycles, walk on tightropes... 
Are you serious!? 
The monkey looks just like you, Kohran! 
Beg your pardon, boss? In what way do I resemble that monkey!? 
No, no, I just meant... You're just as cute as him! 
Nice save, boss. 
But don't take me for some stupid little thing, and watch what you say! 
Sorry about that... Let's move on, Kohran. 
What is it, boss? You look like you're completely mesmerized! 
Did that monkey inspire you to some deep thoughts? 
Ah, no, I... 
Anyway, let's get going. I wanna see lots of stuff while we're here! 
Looking at that monkey again, Uncle Ichi? 
Whoa, what a cute monkey! 
Yeah, kind of. 
Are there monkeys in France, too? <br> It looks just like you, Iris! 
By the way... Are there monkeys in France, too? 
Yep! And they all have blonde hair! 
Wha...!? 
Hehehe... Busted! 
Wait a second... So you were just kidding? 
I suddenly want a monkey plush real bad! 
It looks just like you, Iris! 
What!? What do you mean, Uncle Ichi? 
Oh, er... I just meant you're as cute as him. 
You're not making that up, are you? 
Of... Of course not! Let's just go somewhere else, all right? 
What's up, Uncle Ichi? 
Ah... Sorry. I was just looking at this monkey... 
I've seen everything around here, so let's go somewhere else, please! 
OK, let's go! 
Don't you think there's still other stuff to see? 
Wow, he's really agile! 
Who do you think is more agile, him or you? <br> Do you know monkey-style kung fu? 
I wonder... Who do you think is more agile, him or you? 
Wait, don't talk about me like I'm an ape! But yeah, I guess he's faster than me. 
I see... 
But it's not all about speed. In a fight, you also need to punch hard. I'd beat him hands down. 
Oh, er... Would you now? 
(I really shouldn't encourage her to punch animals...) 
Do you know monkey-style kung fu? 
What's that supposed to be? 
Well, kung fu where you move like a monkey. Seeing this little guy, it just came to my mind. 
Interesting... You sure know a lot of stuff, commander. 
Hahaha... 
Ahaha... If you look at them like this, monkeys are rather cute. 
Absolutely. And clever, too! 
It's not bad to watch a show like this once in a while. 
We already did the cork-shooting. Let's try something else. 
Oh, you can play coconut shy there! 
That looks fun. Do you want to try it, commander? 
Wait, grown-ups can't play! It would be too easy for you! 
If you want to play something, why not try the shooting stall in the back? 
OK, bring it on! <br> ...I'd rather not. 
OK, bring it on! It's only New Year's day once a year, so let's have some fun! 
It's my pleasure! I'll show you to the cork-shooting stall. 
Nah, I don't feel like it. 
No? Too bad... 
Should we go somewhere else? We came all the way here, so let's look at lots of different stalls. 
You're right. OK, let's move on. 
Nah, I don't feel like it. 
No? How boring... 
Isn't that a game for children? 
You never stop learning. Even a children's game can teach you valuable life lessons. 
Should we go somewhere else? We came all the way here, so let's look at lots of different stalls. 
In that case, I'm with you. Let us go. 
Nah, I don't feel like it. 
You don't want to? That's a pity. 
You should save your shooting skills for when we're in battle. 
Hehe... That's true. 
Nah, I don't feel like it. 
What, you don't wanna do it? Boring... 
Should we go somewhere else? We came all the way here, so let's look at lots of different stalls. 
I guess you're right. Let's go then! 
Nah, I don't feel like it. 
Whaaat? You don't wanna!? 
Other stalls look interesting too. Since we're here, let's go around a bit. 
OK then. I don't mind either way. 
Nah, I don't feel like it. 
You don't feel like trying it? Man, what a buzzkill. 
Come, Kanna. You should always leave a little room for more. 
That only applies to food! But whatever you say... 
Good job! Here's your prize. Why don't you give it to your lovely lady? 
This is for you, Sakura! 
Whoa, a pendant? Thank you so much! 
I'm so happy! I'll treasure this! 
This is for you, Sakura! 
Whoa, that takes me back... A Knitting Nancy! 
Thank you, Mr. Ogami! 
This is for you, Sakura! 
Wow, thank you! What a cute cactus! 
But you know, you already gave me a cactus before... 
Whoops, you're right. Sorry, I didn't mean to give you the same thing twice... 
Oh, don't worry. I'm sure they'll look lovely next to each other! 
A cactus. It's so nostalgic...My father loved them... 
Ah, right... 
Ogami, in the language of flowers, the cactus means "passion". 
Even without water, they grow strong. 
I see... 
Oh, don't worry. I'm sure they'll look lovely next to each other! 
Good job! Here's your prize. Why don't you give it to your lovely lady? 
This is for you, Sumire! 
Oh my, how sweet... 
I'll hold this dear, Lieutenant. 
Haha... Don't make me blush. 
This is for you, Sumire! 
My, what a nice doll! But what's this pole for? 
I think it's called a Knitting Nancy? 
How do you use it? I have to ask Sakura when we're back. 
I've received many presents in my life... 
But a toy? That's a first. 
I will treasure it. Thank you, Lieutenant. 
Haha... Don't make me blush. 
This is for you, Sumire! 
Oh, a cactus? Thank you, I'll take good care of it. 
Good job! Here's your prize. Why don't you give it to your lovely lady? 
This is for you, Maria! 
A pendant? Thank you! 
This is for you, Maria! 
A toy? Hehehe... Thank you. 
This is for you, Maria! 
A cactus? I'll take good care of it. 
Good job! Here's your prize. Why don't you give it to your lovely lady? 
This is for you, Kohran! 
Whoa, that pendant is a looker! Thanks so much, boss! 
This is for you, Kohran! 
A toy set? Thanks, boss. 
This is for you, Kohran! 
Oh, a cactus! Thanks, boss. I'll take good care of it. 
Good job! Here's your prize. Why don't you give it to your lovely lady? 
Here, Iris... This is for you! 
Uncle Ichi... You gave me a pendant before, don't you remember? 
Oh, sorry! I didn't mean to give you the same thing again... 
OK! Another addition to my treasure pile! 
Whoa, what a beautiful pendant! Thank you, Uncle Ichi! 
Hehehe... This is my big treasure now! 
Here, Iris... This is for you! 
Wow, how cute! A doll, and a Knitting Nancy too! 
Thanks, Uncle Ichi! I'm so happy! 
Here, Iris... This is for you! 
What's that? Some sort of messed-up flower? 
It's called a cactus. It's not a flower. 
Not a flower? Then these are leaves? 
That's... Ah, it doesn't matter. Let's go, Iris! 
Good job! Here's your prize. Why don't you give it to your lovely lady? 
This is for you, Kanna! 
Thank you, commander! I've never gotten anything like this! 
I'm not one to care for plants, but I'll give it my best! 
This is for you, Kanna! 
That's one cute doll! When I was little, I kind of... I always wanted a doll... 
Thanks, commander. I'll always keep it close. 
This is for you, Kanna! 
Oh, a cactus? Thanks. I'll take good care of it. 
You look like you're really into it. 
Whoa, Mr. Ogami... That takes me back! 
I used to play with these things a lot. <br> I've never really tried it before. 
I used to play with these things a lot. 
You too? When we had one of our country festivals, there always were lots of stalls. 
I was really into it. 
Hehe... That's true. 
Sorry, I've never really tried it before. 
Oh, really? Don't worry, I'll show you. 
Thanks... 
Hmmm... 
Don't you like this? 
No, that's not it... Sorry. 
No need to apologize. Let's just go somewhere else. 
You don't have enough yet? 
How does it work? 
Have you never seen one? <br> You cut out shapes. 
Have you never seen something like this before, Sumire? 
I've never been here on a festival day. 
The point is cutting out certain shapes. 
Of course I know that! Who do you take me for? 
Really...? Ah, no, no! Not like that... 
Don't worry, I can do it alone! No problem at all... 
Why'd it break!? 
Erm... 
So you don't know either, Lieutenant? 
Sorry. 
I've had enough of this childish game. Let's move on. 
You seem to be really enjoying this. 
What do you do with this? 
Oh, you don't know what this is, Maria? 
Let me show you... 
It's something to eat. <br> You cut out shapes. <br> Whoever destroys it first is the winner. 
It's something to eat. 
...So, it's like Risk? 
Er, not really... 
...Hm, it doesn't taste of anything. 
Oh... You really ate it? 
It's sort of a game. You cut out shapes. 
Oh, really? I doesn't look that difficult. 
Oh dear... I've missed. 
Yes, it's a pity. 
It looked so easy when the kids were doing it... Let's give it another go. 
Hahaha, you can't stand losing, huh? 
It's a game. Whoever destroys it first is the winner. 
Oh, really? OK then... 
Whoa! M-Maria! 
Like this? 
Yeah... 
...... 
Let's go, Maria. 
Erm... 
Hehe... You don't know, Mr. Ogami? It's fine, let's go somewhere else. 
Sorry. 
I've had enough of this, boss. Let's make ourselves scarce. 
Hm, this is the first time I've seen something like this. 
What games did you play as a kid? <br> This takes me back... 
By the way, Kohran... What games did you play as a kid? 
Like I told you before, I've only played Hanafuda. 
Interesting... 
Stalls in Japan really have the weirdest stuff. 
This takes me back... I used to do it all the time as a kid. 
Wow. I always thought you'd been born a full-grown adult, boss. 
H-how do you mean? 
I... I was only kidding! No hard feelings, eh? 
...Really? 
Well, erm... 
This your first time too, boss? 
No, not at all! See... 
Come on, boss. It's fine to admit you don't know anything about it. 
Sorry. 
You like it THAT much, Uncle Ichi? 
What's this, Uncle? 
It's something like a relief, I guess. <br> It's something to eat. 
It's something like a relief, I guess. Only made of candy. 
Really!? Show me, show me! 
Oh... You really ate it? 
It doesn't taste of anything. I don't like it... 
Lady. If you eat it, you'll die. 
Whaaaat? Really? 
It's food alright, but... 
Really!? Show me, show me! 
Oh... You really ate it? 
Lady. If you eat it, you'll die. 
Wow, really? 
Why didn't you tell me right away? 
...Hm. What should I say? 
What's this, Uncle Ichi? 
What's this? What's this? What's this? Tell me, Uncle Ichi! 
Hm... I'll explain it to you some other time. 
Hm...? That's interesting. 
Haven't you seen enough of this? You really like it, huh? 
I'm not good with fiddly stuff like that... 
This takes me back... <br> Should we get the biggest one? 
This takes me back... I used to do it all the time as a kid. 
I don't like eensy-weensy stuff. 
Really? But that's the fun thing about it... 
What do you think, Kanna? Should we get the biggest one? 
Thanks, but... That really doesn't change anything. 
No? Well, if you don't feel like it... 
...Phew, this is really hard. 
...Commander. 
Wait a second! This head here... 
Listen... I said I don't like this. Don't you think it's a bit selfish to do it on your own? 
Oh, sorry. I just... 
Come on! Let's go someplace else! 
...Hm? 
H-hey! 
What's that!? 
...! 
What... What are you all...? 
Well... Sumire kind of dragged me along. 
Sumire... 
Er... Hi, Sakura... What a coincidence! 
...What? Everyone together? 
Even you, Maria... 
(Oh, shoot... There goes my quality time with Sumire...) 
No, I... I just showed her around... 
Hm...? No, nothing particular... 
(What should I do? If we go now, we'll be back pretty late...) 
(We can't leave the theater unattended for so long...) 
OK, let's go! <br> We shouldn't leave the theater unattended... 
...OK, let's go! It's New Year's day, so let's have some fun! 
We shouldn't leave the theater unattended... New Year's day or not, we never know when we have to deploy. 
(Hm... What should we do...?) 
Sa... Sakura! 
Er... Hi, Sakura... What a coincidence! 
...What? Everyone together? 
I-Iris!? 
(Oh, shoot... There goes my quality time with Maria...) 
OK. It's nice and quiet here, so let's rest for a while. 
Huh...? What are you saying? You don't have to come if you don't want to. 
I wanted to come here with you... That's why I invited you. 
Kohran... 
Er... Hi, Sakura... What a coincidence! 
...What? Everyone together? 
Even you, Maria... 
(Oh, shoot... There goes my quality time with Kohran...) 
Wha... Why do you ask, all of a sudden? 
Of course... I like you. <br> Hahaha! Sure, I like you! 
Of course... I like you. 
Hahaha! Sure, I like you! 
L-love!? 
(Oh dear... I should be careful what I say...) 
S-Sakura! What a coincidence, running into you here, of all places... 
...What? Everyone together? 
Even you, Maria... 
(Oh man... I was looking forward to spending this day with Iris...) 
Ahaha... Yes, you're right. <br> It's fun once in a while. 
Ahaha... Yes, you're right. 
No really, it's been fun. 
But running here all the way... I mean, what a date! 
... 
It's fun once in a while. 
Oh... No, I didn't mean it that way! Kanna, please wait! 
...... 
S-Sakura! What a coincidence, running into you here, of all places...

Sorry you had to wait! 
You mean this dress? 
I wanted to dress in a real Japanese kimono. New Year's day only comes once a year, after all! 
And also... It's my first date with you, Mr. Ogami. 
Even if you're only flattering me, that makes me happy. 
Thank you, really. 
Ah! The train's here! Let's get on! 
What a crowd! So this is what New Year's day is like in Tokyo! 
I'm so glad Tokyo is finally at peace... 
OK... Let's go too then! 
What a crowd...

So many people in one place... These commoners all behave like faceless drones. 
If you want to make commoners like you, you have to do as they do. 
I hope you appreciate my efforts. 
Come on, commander! Let's go. 
Quickly! 
Oh, not bad! Very festive. 
Oh, stop it... You really went all out there. 
You're a great guy. 
Hey... Do you have to talk shop when it's just the two of us? 
But... that's just what I like about you. 
Come one, let's go. 
So... this is what you do on New Year's day? Not really what I imagined. 
Hmmm, it seems to unmotivated, lonely... 
Oh, let's light some firecrackers! Then we'll get in the mood! 
Really? How boring... 
Right. Wanna go on? 
Whoaaa... So many people! Don't you think, Uncle Ichi? 
Hey, hey, hey... What's that real big house over there? 
Come on, Uncle Ichi! 
Let's go already! 
I'm not telling. 
Let's go then. 
Ohohoho... That's a secret. 
Should we get going? 
Nah, it's nothing... 
Wanna get going? 
No, it's nothing. 
Let's go somewhere else, Uncle Ichi! 
Not telling! 
Step right up, step right up! We've got a monkey straight from China! 
How about it? Wanna give it a go, sir? 
Let's try it, Mr. Ogami! 
Hmph... A childish diversion. 
Commander! Let's try that!

Hey, Uncle Ichi. I wanna try!

Not bad at all! 
I'm impressed, boss! 
You're so awesome, Uncle Ichi!

Please come here, Mr. Ogami. 
Come here for a moment. 
Really, commander... Why did you have to take me to such an out of the way place? 
Oh, you don't need to blush. There's no one around who could see us. 
Oh, commander! And Sumire, too... 
Sakura... 
Unused
Heya, Sakura! Fancy running into you here! 
Wh... Why are you all here? 
Unused
That's right! Isn't it nice for all of the Flower Division to celebrate New Year together? 
Exactly. We wanted to have fun together. 
That was fun! Something like this isn't bad once in a while. A bit like a date. 
What? What what what? What's with that artificial laugh? 
So being with me really isn't enough...? 
Oh, commander! And Kanna, too. 
S-Sakura!?

Unused
Wh-wh-why is everyone here all of a sudden!? 
Come on, boss... Where else would we go on New Year's day but the shrine? 
That's right! Isn't it nice for all of the Flower Division to celebrate New Year together? 
Well... That's it, really. 
Phew... There's a bunch of people everywhere. Really makes me tired. 
Thanks. Tell me one thing, boss... 
Are you happy you visited the shrine with me?n 
Really? Makes me happy to hear you say so, boss! 
Oh, commander! And Kohran, too. 
S-Sakura!? 
Unused
Oooh, there's Sakura! Yoohoo! 
Why's everyone here all of a sudden!? 
Ohohoho... Where else would we go on New Year's day but the shrine? 
Didn't we agree on celebrating New Year together? 
Not really... 
That's right! Isn't it nice for all of the Flower Division to celebrate New Year together? 
That's it! 
Tell me, Uncle Ichi... What do you think of me? 
Do you... like me? 
Hehehe... I love you too, Uncle! 
Aww, come on! If you wanna confess your love, you have to be serious! 
Oh, commander! And Iris, too. 
Ah... Sakura! 
So you really wanted to visit the shrine with everyone, Mr. Ogami? 
Sakura! What are the odds? 
Why's everyone here? 
Come on, boss... Where else would we go on New Year's day but the shrine? 
Just get crazy for once! 
That's right! Isn't it nice for all of the Flower Division to celebrate New Year together? 
Oh, look... A manifestation of the North Star Buddha! 
I have to pay my respects, as a user of the North Star Fencing style. 
Daaaaaaaa! 
Whoa... 
Unused
We just followed you! 
We can't let you have all the fun! 
Ohohohoho... 
Don't surprise me like that! You just wanted to give me scare! 
Let's all visit the shrine together! 
Unused
Right on! That's what I like about you! 
It feels like we're being watched... 
Hahahaha...! 
That voice... 
Over there! 
So we meet again, my friends of the Imperial Floral Storm Troop! 
My name is Aoi Satan! 
The Black Web...? Don't make me laugh. 
That Tenkai's finished for good. After all, he was nothing more than the shogunate's lap dog. 
But I, Aoi Satan, am of a different breed! I'll never give up! 
Your precious peace won't continue forever. Pray all you want! 
A ridiculous man like you, so easily bewitched by the charms of women... 
You'll never stop me. 
I'll level this city for good. All humans will cower before me! 
What I want? Hehehehe... 
I just can't stand the sight of happy humans! 
On the other hand, nothing excites me like the look of pain and fear in their eyes! 
You won't get to enjoy that on our watch! 
I'll destroy everyone and everything you love! 
What!? 
Hehehe... Come to me, all ye children of the gutter, all ye oppressed and evil! 
I am the great liberator of demons! Come forth, Koma! 
That's...!? 
Hehe... Heeheeheeheeheee! 
What the hell? 
Look out, everyone! 
Unused
Ah! The Shogeimaru! 
Seems like we just made it! 
The Shogeimaru! We're saved! 
OK! Let's beat that fool up! 
Let's go!

Sorry. I wanted to stop them all... 
I never expected a day like this to come... 
To finally be able to enjoy these carefree days... 
You're right... I could never go back to what I was like back then. 
Oh, what am I saying? I shouldn't dwell on those old stories. 
New Year's day in Russia? 
It's not that different from Japan. 
We get together with friends and party all night. 
And then, when the day is dawning across the snowy fields, we turn towards it and say a prayer. 
We pray to have another good year. 
Maybe not, but... Am I really that different now? 
Hehe... I'm sorry. Back then, I was just... 
But even so... That greenhorn Lieutenant Ogami risked his life to save me. 
Don't play it down, commander. I'm really grateful. 
Hehe, I guess you're right. 
Unused
Visiting the shrine at the side of a gentleman... This is a first for me. 
Is it that strange? 
What did you think I am, Mr. Ogami?! 
Oh no, those gentlemen never talk to me. 
They don't talk to ME. They talk to the daughter of the Kanzaki conglomerate. 
I'm sure you would look splendid in formal wear though. 
You're a lieutenant, after all. You must at least have learned ballroom dancing, right? 
Just say the word, and it would be my pleasure to help you remember... 
Hohoho, impossible! I could teach you all the secret techniques of ballroom dancing. 
We should definitely give it a go sometime. As I said... whenever you want! 
You're late, Lieutenant! Didn't you practice running in the Navy? 
Ahaha... This feels so good I got carried away a little. 
Come on! This little stroll is enough to make you huff and puff like you're about to die? 
Pathetic... In Okinawa, the men aren't that weak. 
Yeah, my old man was very strong, too. He'd never bitch and moan. Always training like a fiend. 
Ha! But, as a woman I can't really brag about this. That's why I like strong men. 
And I'm not talking about Karate and stuff. 
A guy who doesn't give up, no matter what... That's real strength. 
Hehe... You should do some exercising under Okinawa's scorching sun, too! 
I just love the place! Every time I go back there, I forget about all my troubles. 
I'd really like to take you there some day. That endless sky, the azure sea... 
Uuuuncle Iiiichiiii! Come one, come ON! 
Can I ask you something? What do people think when they see us like this? 
That we're siblings? A couple? Or a girl who's being kidnapped by a stranger? 
Hehe! Just kidding! 
About that place we're going to... It's called a "shrine", right? 
Hehehe, that's great! I have to tell Mama and Papa in a letter! 
I wrote one just the other day. I told them of you, Uncle Ichi. 
How you kissed me! 
How you told me you loved me. 
Did I do something wrong? I'm not so much younger than Sakura! 
Soon, you won't see me as a child anymore! 
I'll be older than the other girls in no time! 
Unused
It's all right! Trust me! 
There was just a little problem with the engine back then. 
It's a whole different beast now! 
I improved it a lot, especially the suspension! Thanks to my special fuel, the engine is 2.5 times more powerful! 
If I put wings on it, it'd probably take off! 
This is the first run with human passengers though. 
Don't worry! Just think about how lucky you are, boss! 
You're the first guy who gets to ride behind me! 
Other than certain individuals, I don't let just anyone near me! 
All right! Here we fly! 
Wa-wa-wait a second, boss! Where do you think you're holding on to!? 
Stop it, stop it! Move your hands a little lower! 
Eeek! Not THAT low! Higher, higher! 
I gotta ask, boss... You didn't do that on purpose, did ya? 
Well, all right. 
Wow... So many people... 
Everyone looks like they're having fun. 
Ah, sorry. I'm not used to something like this... 
Yes... 
Hehehe... You're right. 
Me? I'll wish for this peace to go on forever. 
Thank you, commander. This was a lovely day. 
I felt like I could forget about all those hard times for the first time. 
Do you have anything planned for later? 
I was wondering... Maybe you'd want to take a stroll to Yokohama with me? 
A friend of mine has a cafe at the harbor. It's small, but... 
I've been meaning to go there. But it would have felt stupid going there alone. 
Yeah, that's true... 
Thank you! 
Guys...! 
What are you all doing here? 
OK! Let's go there together with all the Flower Division!
