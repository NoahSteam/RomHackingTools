I need to focus! 
Here I go! 
Leave it to me!! 
Watch this, Ogami. 
I'm fine, I can still fight… 
Thank you! 
Keep it up, Ogami! 
I knew I could count on you! 
Kyaaa! 
Ngh, I'll show you next time! 
I'm sorry… Ogami… 
It's my turn in the spotlight. 
Hahaha! 
I'm off!! 
Today's performance is all for you! 
It'll take more than that to bring me down… 
Ensign, so you really do care for me… 
Come, Ensign, it's your move! 
I'll be watching you! 
Uwahhh!! 
I suppose I'll let you win for now! 
The captain needs me!! 
I'll have to take down the enemies myself! 
Where's my next target!? 
Whoever wants to die first, just step forward… 
I'll be relying on your orders, sir! 
I'm not finished yet!! Not yet!! 
!! 
Focus, sir! 
We'll make it out of this alive, sir! 
Ahhh… 
They're too strong!! I need to withdraw!! 
Forgive me, sir. I need to withdraw! 
I can fight too! 
Here I go! 
I'm super strong! 
I'll fight hard for Mon Frère!! 
Uh, some of these lights are flashing… 
You're the best, Mon Frère! 
Go get 'em Mon Frère! 
I'll be watching! 
Kyaaaa… 
Stupid… stars… 
Sorry, Mon Frère… 
Gonna go all out. 
Better not underestimate science~! 
Movin' out!! 
Check this out! 
I'm takin' too much damage here! 
Aww, you're the best! 
I'm rootin' for ya! 
Take 'em down, Boss! 
Uwahhh… 
Dangit… they got me… 
Sorry Chief… 
All right! Let's do this!! 
Full power! Hiyaaaaa! 
Feast your eyes on the killer techniques of the Kirishima! 
Let's take 'em down, Boss!! 
No problem! It's just a scratch!! 
Thanks! I owe you one! 
Get in there, Boss! 
Let's see what you can do! 
Uwahhh… 
Damn. Guess I still haven't trained enough… 
I've gotta keep fighting… for the Boss. 
All right! 
We did it! 
We did it! 
Phew! 
Nice one! 
Woo! We did it!! 
The Imperial Assault Troupe has arrived!! 
I think everyone will be fine without my protection. 
I will protect you, Sakura! 
I'll always be there to protect you, Sumire. 
Let me watch your back for you, Maria. 
I'll always be there for you, Iris. 
Don't worry, Kohran! I'll protect you! 
Kanna! I've got your back! 
Hive of Darkness! Where did you run off to!?
Setsuna! Get out here! 
Hehehe! It appears you're quite terrified of the others finding out about your past. 
Oh no!! 
Look, Ogami! 
Maria!! 
Hurry! We need to get Maria out of there as soon as possible! 
Roger! 
Kohran's attacks and Sumire's special attack are best for taking on groups of enemies. 
Destroying obstacles can clear a path, but it also takes time. We should just avoid them whenever possible. 
Knowing how far the enemy can move and attack is the key to a good strategy. 
What? Maria's not here! 
Ogami, Maria's not here! 
Ensign, Maria's not here! 
Maria's not here, Boss! 
Hey Chief, Maria isn't here! 
Are there any clues where she went? 
…!! Hey, there's a locket here! It's Maria's! 
Ogami! There's a locket over here! …It's Maria's!! 
Ensign! Look, there's a locket here. Isn't this Maria's!? 
Boss, there's a locket over here! This is Maria's! 
Hey Chief, there's a locket over here… Hey, this is Maria's!! 
Damn, we're too late… 
Fuhahahaha!! 
!? 
The woman is in my care. If you want her back, Ichiro Ogami, you must come and face me alone! 
Until then, her life is in my hands!! 
Such cowardice… I have an even lower opinion of the Hive of Darkness than before! 
Ensign! Look at that! 
So… They want you to ride on that? 
Ogami! This is definitely a trap. 
Yeah! This isn't going to end well if you just waltz right in there like they want you to! 
What kind of captain can't protect the members of his unit?! 
Ogami… 
Listen… if Maria's the only one who makes it out of this… 
I want you all to keep going as the Flower Division, with her as your captain! 
What are you saying, Chief? 
I'll get Maria out of this. I swear I will! I'll leave the rest to you all!! 
Captaaaain! 
Maria's Koubu appears to be immobile. Advance to her location and help her out. 
Hahaha! You walked right into my trap!!
