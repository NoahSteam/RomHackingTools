This is the end for you foolish children. You'll have an eternity in Hell to regret challenging me!! 
W-what!? 
Sakura!! 
Mon Frère!! 
Boss!! 
You guys are late!! 
You had us worried!! 
Right!! 
Fools! What difference could two units possibly make!! Go, my minions!! 
It seems it's finally time for you to see the true power of Crimson Miroku. 
Kyaaaaaa! 
Ahahahaha! 
Huh? Hey wait! Isn't that Miroku's voice!? 
She must've slipped out when her mech exploded! Damn, she's a hard one to finish off! 
Hahaha! Today was no victory for you. 
Even now, Satan is… well, you'll see… ha ha, hahaha, ahahahaha! 
Lieutenant General Yoneda and Ayame are worried! We should hurry and return. 
I've gotten the door open! Hurry everyone, let's get out of here!! 
I got the door open! Hurry, let's get out of here!! 
I opened the door! Come on everyone, run!! 
Well done! Now we can chase down Miroku!! 
Alright! Now we can chase down Miroku! 
OK! Now we just have to trap Miroku! 
Nice one! Now we can get at Miroku!

Nice! Now we can go take down Miroku! 
Great! Now we can get to where Miroku is!

Yay, you came back, Sakura! 
Iris… 
We were worried about ya, Sakura! 
Kohran… thanks. 
We were all waiting for you, Sakura. 
Maria… 
Good grief, girl, do you know how much you had us worried? Well, at least we're together now. 
Sumire… 
We were waiting for ya, Sakura! Something just doesn't feel right without you here. 
Thanks, Kanna. 
Everyone, I can be strong because you're all here with me! Ogami and the whole Flower Division!! 
So I know I can win this! I can't lose this fight… for my own sake, and for everyone else too! 
There's a switch to open the door over in the light from the lamp! 
Come to me, my faithful servants! I summon thee, Crimson Wasp Squad! 
There's a switch for the door in the light from the lamp over there. Hurry, Sakura!! 
Damn! So their attack was just a decoy to hold us up!? 
Mon Frère… you're hiding something… 
There are several Rear Guard breaking through here too!! I can't offer any help, but please focus and win this!! 
Ogami… about those things I was saying earlier, about my childhood… 
Please… don't tell anyone else about that. 
I understand. It'll be our secret. 
Hehe… it's kind of embarrassing when you put it that way. 
But I'm glad I talked to you about it. I don't want my memories of the past to hold me back anymore. 
After all, now I have you and the Flower Division to help me. 
Sakura… 
Let's go, Ogami! If we fight together, we can definitely win this! 
Aw c'mon, you can tell us. You shouldn't keep secrets from your squad-mates. 
No! It's a secret between Ogami and me. 
Hmm… what should I do… 
If you tell a soul, you'll feel my wrath! Got it, Ogami! 
Whoa!! OK, I got it! I won't say a word to anyone! 
'Old lady'!? You… you little brat!! 
OK, I got it. <br> Do I really need to keep this a secret? 
Boss! There's transformed Crimson Wasps in with the equipment! 
I trust you, Ogami! 
I feel much stronger when you're with me! 
So… please fight by my side! 
I think everyone will be fine without my protection. 
I will protect you, Sakura! 
I'll always be there to protect you, Sumire. 
Let me watch your back for you, Maria. 
I'll always be there for you, Iris. 
Don't worry, Kohran! I'll protect you! 
Kanna! I've got your back! 
I've got to focus! 
Here I go! 
Leave it to me!! 
Watch this, Ogami. 
I'm fine, I can still fight… 
Thank you! 
Keep it up, Ogami! 
I knew I could count on you! 
Kyaaa! 
Ngh, I'll show you next time! 
I'm sorry… Ogami… 
It's my turn in the spotlight. 
Hahaha! 
I'm off!! 
Today's performance is all for you! 
It'll take more than that to bring me down… 
Ensign, so you really do care for me… 
Come, Ensign, it's your move! 
I'll be watching you! 
Uwahhh!! 
I suppose I'll let you win for now! 
The captain needs me!! 
I'll have to take down the enemies myself! 
Where's my next target!? 
Whoever wants to die first, just step forward… 
I'll be relying on your orders, sir! 
I'm not finished yet!! Not yet!! 
You would go that far… for my sake… 
Focus, sir! 
We'll make it out of this alive, sir! 
Ahhh!! 
They're too strong!! I need to withdraw!! 
Forgive me, sir. I need to withdraw! 
I can fight too! 
Here I go! 
I'm super strong! 
I'll fight hard for Mon Frère!! 
Uh, some of these lights are flashing… 
You're the best, Mon Frère! 
Go get 'em Mon Frère! 
I'll be watching! 
Kyaaaa!! 
Stupid… stars… 
Sorry, Mon Frère… 
Gonna go all out. 
Better not underestimate science~! 
Movin' out!!

I'm takin' too much damage here! 
Aww, you're the best! 
I'm rootin' for ya! 
Take 'em down, boss! 
Uwahhh… 
Dangit… they got me… 
Sorry Boss… 
Alright! Let's do this!! 
Full power! Hiyaaaaa! 
Feast your eyes on the killer techniques of the Kirishima! 
Let's take 'em down, boss!! 
No problem! It's just a scratch!! 
Thanks! I owe you one! 
Get in there, boss! 
Let's see what you can do! 
Uwahhh… 
Damn. Guess I still haven't trained enough… 
I've gotta keep fighting… for the boss. 
Alright! 
We did it! 
We did it! 
Phew! 
Nice one! 
Woo! We did it!! 
Hey Kohran, what're those things over there that look like Koubus? 
We keep parts and equipment here for repairing the Koubus, including extra pieces of Koubu armor. 
… but was there really always this many of 'em in here? 
Kuuuuuu~!
