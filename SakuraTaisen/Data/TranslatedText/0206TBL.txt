It's a photo of Sakura. She's looking right at me. I wonder what she's thinking…
It's a photo of Sumire. This is a side of her you don't see too often.
It's a photo of Maria. …She's lost in thought and looks kind of sad…
A photo of Kanna. She looks strong and reliable. I can't wait to meet her.
A photo of Iris. She's surrounded by flowers and flashing a radiant smile.
A photo of Kohran. She's looking pretty in profile with her face dyed red by the evening sun.
A letter given to me by a customer. I was asked to give it to Sumire. I have a bad feeling about this…
Maria's pistol. This may help me escape from here…
A hair ornament. It's decorated with flowers and looks very elegant.
A pretty pendant. The delicate workmanship is gorgeous.
A hairpin for use in a traditional bun hairstyle. It would complement a formal outfit well.
This key will let me enter rooms I couldn't before.
I found this in a bedroom on the second floor. I can use it to access the back room.
A teacup Iris asked me to get for her. It has a very stylish design.
This is the matchbox Iris asked for. Its logo is quite colorful.
A knife Iris asked me to get for her. Just a normal utensil you'd use during a meal.
A prop sword and shield used onstage. They're well-made and look just like the real thing.
A prop crown used onstage. It's well constructed and incredibly detailed.
A wig and costume used onstage. I wonder what kind of act could use a flashy outfit like this?
A photo of Sakura in her swimsuit. Wow, this is really something. I'm gonna treasure this.
A photo of Sumire in her stage costume. Her distinctive makeup really makes an impact.
It's a photo of Maria on stage in the military uniform from "For Love"… She's a beautiful woman disguised as a man.
A photo of Kanna in her training gear. Catching her in a private moment like this feels surprisingly intimate.
A photo of Iris in her swimsuit. She's holding a rubber ring and looks ready to have some fun. How cute.
A photo of Kohran. I don't get to see her with her braids undone very often. It's a nice look.
A photo of Ayame in a traditional outfit. I hope she'll always be as happy and content as she is here.
Ayame's gun. Why…? Why did it have to turn out like this…?
Jean-Paul the teddy bear. Iris's best friend. She always carries him with her and takes good care of him.
Test299
Sure enough that girl… <br> She's called Red Kid <br> It might be the manager's room about this time….
Oh, is it ok?
Oh, is it ok?
God.nI understand the feeling but….
These photos are mainly for guests, so please just take one.
Indulging in your desire, but it is not ok for a first lieutenant to buy.
I see, it can't be helped…I'll come again.
You'd like to buy this photo? Thank you!
That's Sakura's picture isn't it. That will be 50 yen.
We need to leave some for the guests, so just take one for now, okay?
Ogami, I appreciate your interest, but…
These photos are mainly for guests, so please just take one.
Oh, I guess that's true. I'll come again some other time.
You'd like to buy that? Thank you!
Sakura is playing the part of the town girl this month and sales are amazing.
Huh? one?….nI don't know this person.nIs it someone new?
That's right. I came in here at almost the same time.
Well, new friends yea. It will be great if we get along well.
You'd like to buy this photo? Thank you!
That's a photo of Sumire. That'll be 50 zeni.
We need to leave some for the guests, so just take one for now, okay?
Ogami, I appreciate your interest, but…
These photos are mainly for guests, so please just take one.
Oh, I guess that's true. I'll come again some other time.
You'd like to buy that? Thank you!
Sumire is playing a supporting role. She says boo hoo.
Yes, that sounds like Sumire. Seems like that her bad tongue is still active.
You'd like to buy this photo? Thank you!
That's a photo of Maria. That'll be 50 zeni.
We need to leave some for the guests, so just take one for now, okay?
Ogami, I appreciate your interest, but…
These photos are mainly for guests, so please just take one.
Oh, I guess that's true. I'll come again some other time.
You'd like to buy that? Thank you!
Maria is playing a male role this month.She wears a military uniform and she looks really good!
At that time Maria played the part of the captain.
A Captain's work is rough but good luck with the lieutenant.
You'd like to buy this photo? Thank you!
That's a photo of Kanna. That'll be 50 zeni.
We need to leave some for the guests, so just take one for now, okay?
Casona? Who? That person? Me, I don't know him.
Now that you mention it, that's right. Casona always showed up on trips.
Ogami, I appreciate your interest, but…
These photos are mainly for guests, so please just take one.
Oh, I guess that's true. I'll come again some other time.
You'd like to buy that? Thank you!
Kanna is an expert in the art of karate. Plus, she's got an amazing figure!
You are not my superior. If we can get along great.
Since Casona is a friendly person I'm sure she will quickly become friends even with Koran.
You'd like to buy this photo? Thank you!
That's a photo of Iris. That'll be 50 zeni.
We need to leave some for the guests, so just take one for now, okay?
Ogami, I appreciate your interest, but…
These photos are mainly for guests, so please just take one.
Oh, I guess that's true. I'll come again some other time.
You'd like to buy that? Thank you!
Seems like Iris is also happy that Ogami has come.
Right! I was in the weapon's group but….
Iris's light war is also under development. I think the notification will reach Ginza headquarters in July.
You'd like to buy this photo? Thank you!
That's a photo of Kohran. That'll be 50 zeni.
We need to leave some for the guests, so just take one for now, okay?
Oh no, no. Shoi, I'm a little shy so please stop.
Huh?…..but Ogami,I already bought Kohran's photo and gave it to her.
Whaa? Hosoma? Mind you, even if we still meet why do you need my photo?
Something caught your attention didn't it.. <br>nI think it's so cute <br>nSeems like the money is just scraping by
Actually there is no reason, but something caught my attention …
Um, Shoi is a friend of mine.
By the way, I'm really happy Shoi.
I think it's cute. I bought one just a little while ago.
Oh no no, you think it's cute! I feel shy.
pardon me but…I'm really happy Shoi.
I thought you were just scraping by….because at that time you just had a little bit of money.
What? For a little small change you bought my picture?
I'm sure there is a better way to say it right Shoi?
At any rate Shoi, please forgive me.
Kohran, For sure Ogami is embarrassed.
Ha ha ha, oh no.
Anyway he bought and so he knew it was something special right
Ogami, I appreciate your feeling, but…
These photos are mainly for guests, so please just take one.
Oh, I guess that's true. I'll come again some other time.
Ogami, I appreciate your interest, but…
These photos are mainly for guests, so please just take one.
Oh, I guess that's true. I'll come again some other time.
You'd like to buy that? Thank you!
Lieutenant, we're friends. You won't go because of the picture will you?
No, it was just something I thought I would do to commemorate.
…another thing Lieutenant.
You'd like to buy that? Thank you!
Ogami, that's enough photos. But please also look for Kohran.
I get it. Thank you very much.
No matter how much I look, it's not in my room.
Oh well, I will look in another room.
….if it were here, I thought somebody would be here but…
Well nothing to be done, lets go.
Outside it is sunny May weather. Here and there I can see paper koi fish swimming on the roofs.
I'm not just looking at the scenery. I have to find the Lieutenant.n
Hmmm…. I wonder if he is not here either.
There's nothing to be done. Lets look in another room.
Oh my gosh! Lieutenant! It's been a long time hasn't it!
Sumire, I hope to hear from you! From today on it will be difficult for me.
Shoi, I was going to the manager's office to get some direction but on the way I forgot where it was.
The manager's office? If you want the manager's office it is on the first floor.
….Shoi. You'd better get some good direction!
What! It's not on the second floor? Even Shoi is cheap.
Well Lieutenant, afterwards lets have some tea and talk.
Great! Cool Sumire. I'll see you later.
Ah, Lieutenant! You came back!
Iris! Good to see you! Have you been well?
Yes! You know Lieutenant Iris's office has been very busy lately.
Sorry, I….nPeople are always coming to the manager's office. I'll see you later Iris.
What!? This is boring!
Huh? My uncle's office is on the first flooe. Why is it you came here?
What! It's not on the second floor? Even Shoi is cheap.
Lieutenant, this time hang out with me.
Yea, you're right. Ok, see you Iris.
…..Shoi. It seems the manager's office is on the first floor.
What, it's already….nNo matter how many times I climb these stairs it's hard work.
Shoi, I have a good idea! If Hosoma doesn't want to be a guide I can go by myself!
….. This place looks good. Now where did she go?
Why don't I go check somewhere else.
Oh, the
Well, I'm thinking I'll go to the manager's office and give her some guidance…
Uh, you've already helped! It's so wide, I totally got lost.
Well, since I'm a guide I can accompany you.
Thank you, that would be great.
…..Not here it seems, and not on the stage.
Maybe she already left. I wonder where she's gone off to.
I know…. Kohran and Hanagumi are employees that's why they are on the stage.
Uh, please excuse me. The difficult road made me late.
Shoi, didn't you go to the manager's office?
Oh yea, right. Because of the difficult road there's no time.
As might be expected. Are you not coming back?
Ok then I'll look in the other room.
Shoi, now that you mention it, I think she was sitting at the reception desk.
……I, We're at an impasse. It's Mogiri's work to punch the tickets you know.n
Is that right! So that's what he does.
That is strange his work is getting interrupted. Listen, quickly go to the manager's office
Shoi, if we take too much time the guests will start coming.
Yea, little by little we'll get to the manager's office.
She's not outside. Korahn left the bike that she rode here.
Hmmm, I wonder if it's ok she left her bike like that?
It's fine!If it drops from the first floor I will repair it.
Ogami, if we loiter too much the guests are going to start coming.
Yea, that's true. Little by little's t we'll get to the manager's office
Hmmm….Not in the dining room.
Ok, I'll have to look in another room.
It's no trouble at all. <br> The battle was long and hard, wasn't it?n
It's no big deal. It's like empty space man.
…..Was there just a fight?
Shoi, I she didn't come here just now. <br> Are you getting hungry?
No, it's not that but….
But really, after we go to the manager's office it would be just fine to eat all you want yea?
Not in the kitchen. It can't be! She is not supposed to be in this kind of place.
Shall we look in another room?
Huh, not in the kitchen.
I prefer tinkering with machines over cooking if I'm being honest.
Is there something you need to do here, boss?
Uh no, not especially.
Ok then why don't we go to the manager's office.
Ah, Ogami. What's up?
I was looking for you! <br> Just strolling around… <br> I snuck away from work.n
I'm sure you already looked in the manager's office. I was thinking you would let me know what happend….
Cool! I was just saying hello to Yuri and Kasumi here.
Now that Kohran is back the theater will be even more lively.
Yes, yes Ogami. You and I are in sync. If you would be so nice as to return I'd be so happy!
Right Kohran! We used to turn those flower stores into amusement parks!
This time I'll show you the most impressive place to ride!
Oh cheating! Well later ok.
ok then Okami. I hope to see you again sometime.
Yea, ok then Kohran, are you going to the manager's office?
Really Riyu, I hope to see you again.
So you were hanging around for no particular reason. Why in this place?
Who me? This is the place where Yuri, Kasumi and I met.
Yes, yes Ogami. You and I are in sync. If you would be so nice as to return I'd be so happy!
Right Kohran! We used to turn those flower stores into amusement parks!
This time I'll show you the most impressive place to ride!
Oh cheating! Well later ok.
So Ogami could you take me to Kohran's office?
Yea, ok then Kohran, are you going to the manager's office?
Really Riyu, I hope to see you again.
A little bit of work came up.
In that case, Ogami, would you please send Kohran to the manager's office.
Kohran and I are in agreement, I want to be a guide, but right now I have to let go.
Ogami, If I have free time then there is work to do! Later please come to my office.
Uh, sure.
Really Riyu, I hope to see you again.
Ok Kohran, see you later!
Shoi? Where are you, dazed?
Yes, yes Kohran and more than that I will teach him about the flower shop journey.
The flower shop journey always becomes an amusement park, right?Which ride do you like the best?
Good information Makashitoki! There is a lot of maintenace for those rides!
Yuri, we are in sync. It is exciting but it's not ok if it causes you a lot of trouble.
In that case, Ogami, would you please send Kohran to the manager's office.
Yea, ok then Kohran, are you going to the manager's office?
Really Riyu, I hope to see you again.
Please tell Yuri it's been a long time!
Ah, Kohran!? It's been a long time!
When did you come Kohran?
Just now. From today on I am indebted to you.
You know Kohran and Yuri?
Yea, Kohran and I are in sync.
Yes, yes Kohran and more than that I will teach him about the flower shop journey.
The flower shop journey always becomes an amusement park, right?Which ride do you like the best?
Good information Makashitoki! There is a lot of maintenace for those rides!
Yuri, we are in sync. It is exciting but it's not ok if it causes you a lot of trouble.
So Ogami could you take me to Kohran's office?
Yea, ok you're going to Kohran's office?
Really Riyu, I hope to see you again.
Ogami, Has no one shown Kohran around?
The manager's office is right next to her. Is she still hanging
We need to go quickly. Otherwise we will be keeping Komeda waiting.
Yes, yes that's right. Well let's go!
Just a minute Shoi! Is the manager's office here?
Uh…..yes, yes it is. Just now inadvertently…
It's ok Shoi, you are not a young person.
Ogami!
Hmmm? That voice…
Oh Sakura. Did you just come from the stage?
Yes. This time I am costarring with Maria.
Here we are in front of the manager's office. Has Kohran come yet?
We have been looking for Kohran. Maybe she is bringing her child with her.
Let's go in Ogami.
What! Kohran hasn't come yet?
Mmm, looks like she hasn't come yet. How is it that she hasn't been sent here?
Hmmm…. that's worrisome.
Idiot!
Ah Yes! I apologize!
Ugh, Ogami, you still haven't seen Kohran?
I……I'm sorry. I will look a little more.
Um Shoi maybe you shouldn't. What do you think?
Well, I'm thinking I should guide her to the manager's office.
But the manager's office is really close to her. I wonder if she was here but didn't realize it?
Hmm? You think so? Ha ha,
Oh, Ogami-san, hello.
The current play is called "For Love". It is a French play.
Maria and Sakura play the leads. Maria in the role of Sir Andre is quite the spectacle…
I've got to say, she looks quite charming in men's clothes!
Whoa…that sounds fun.
Ogami, you still haven't found Kohran?
Yea…. I wonder where she went.
Since it has been a long time since Kohran has been here she is probably walking around the building looking at all the places nostalgically.
Oh Ogami, Kohran! Welcome!
(A shopkeeper's outfit. Tsubaki looks good in it.)
H, hey, Ogami! Where do you think you're looking? Stop!
Ogami… come on, don't stare at me like that. It's embarrassing.
Kohran! Good to see you!
Tsubaki, you look really good. I'm glad to see you. I still owe you.
Same here. Really good to see you.
Kohran, I was hoping you would come on your bike and see me but did you not come because of Teirei?
Nah, those things are always so crowded. Besides, the weather was nice and Asakusa isn't that far away.
Well when it comes to bikes I have a lot of luck. Good luck on the stage.
Ogami have you found Kohran yet?
Well….not yet. Where could she have gone?
When you meet her please guide her right to the manager's office ok.
Is something wrong, Ogami?
Are you staring at Tsubaki because she's so cute?
No way Kohran! Don't tease me!
Boss, don't you think that staring at women like that interferes with your work a bit?
Is something wrong, Ogami?
… Shouldn't you be looking for Kohran?
What the… why is there already a poster of me up there!!
How embarrassing… don't look at me like that, boss!
What is that…?
That is a poster of Kohran. After all she is a member of the Flower Squad.
Thanks for your business! Come again!
Bye Tsubaki. Catch you later!
See you later, Kohran.
Yoneda's office. We're here.
Man, it has been a while since I last saw the old man…
Ogami!
Hmmm? That voice…
Oh Sakura. Did you just come from the stage?
Yes. This time I am costarring with Maria.
(She braided her hair… Cute.)
(She is wearing subtle make up for the stage. Nice!)
Mr. Ogami… can you please stop staring at me like that? It's embarrassing!
…Boss! You know if you stare at someone like this you should at least say something!
(Woah, that blouse shows a lot of skin.)
(…But compared to what Sumire wears, it's still pretty tame.)
(… Though, now that I think about it, compared to Sumire's usual get up, this is still pretty tame.)
… Mr. Ogami, would you mind not staring at me like that?
S-sorry.
Hey Boss, where do you think you are going?
I'll be playing a citizen this time.
How do you like my outfit?
It really suits you. <br> A bit racy, isn't it? <br> I like your normal outfit better.n
It really suits you. Very cute!
You think so? …Thank you.
It really is! Totally cute.
A bit racy, isn't it? Showing so much skin…
Really? I thought it was one of the tamer outfits, to be honest…
Yeah, boss, there are way more extreme outfits than this!
Hm… I like your normal outfit better.
Is that so…?
Boss! Don't say stuff like that!
I… erm… well…
Hahaha! Look at you boss, getting all red in the face!
…Mr. Ogami? Who is that?
Hi there! I'm Li Kohran!
I just arrived here from the Flower Mansion. Nice to meet you!n
Hi, My name is Sakura Shinguji. I joined the squad just recently. Nice to meet you too.
Ah, so we'll be working together then. Awesome! I'm sure we'll get along just fine.
Of course!
OK then… I have to go to the stage. Mr. Ogami, Miss Li, if you'd excuse me.
Oh stop it with that "Miss Li". Way too formal.
Simply "Kohran" will do just fine.
… Is that so? See you later… Kohran.n
Sakura, huh? She seems like a nice girl.n
So how do you get along with her, boss?
Very well! <br> Normal, I guess. <br> Not so good, I fear.
Very well! Since we're both newbies, we have a lot in common.
I see.n
Hm… Normal I guess. It's not like we're friends or anything.
You're not? Well, since you are both newbies you didn't have many chances to get to know each other, I guess.
Not so good, I fear. I guess we are very different…
…Boss. You know, with you being the lieutenant and all, you really shouldn't say stuff like this.
That's really not what I expect of an imperial lieutenant.
You're right. I shouldn't have said that.
I… hmm… well…n
Oh, sorry boss. That was a stupid thing to ask, I guess.
But no need to lie to me, boss. You can be always be honest with me.
… By the way, lieutenant, do you mind if I just call you boss?
Of course. <br> No way! <br> How about you call me 'lover boy'?
Of course.
Thanks. I always have trouble calling Yoneda 'Lieutenant General' too.
I just love how relaxed the Flower Division of the Revue is about things like that.
… What?! I kind of like being called lieutenant, but…
That's fine. No need to fuss about a name, right?n
All right then! Boss it is!
You know… how about you call me lover boy?
What are you talking about? Cut it out, will you?
… nice joke, though. I actually thought you were serious there for a second! Hahaha!n
Glad that you have a sense of humor then. I can tell we'll be getting along great!
Well… That's a good question…
Looks like it is all the same to you. Boss it is!
Okay, Boss?
Of… of course.
So shall we go inside then, boss? Yoneda must be waiting.
Yes, let's go in.
…Boss, where are you going?
Ogami! Come in!
Kohran Li, reporting back for duty!
Ah Kohran! Good to have you back. I hope you'll not miss the Flower mansion too much.
Nah, as long as I get to tinker around with machines I don't really care where I am.
In regard to that, the lieutenant has a kind heart.
Vice Admiral Yoneda!
Hahahahaha! Well, thank you for your service.
There is something I need to discuss with Maria. Show Kohran to her room, Ogami.n
And after that, go to the administration office to help Kasumi.
…Understood!
Thanks boss!
It's no trouble at all. <br> The battle was long and hard, wasn't it?n
It's no big deal. It's like empty space man.
…..Was there just a fight?
Would you look at that… you don't let anything burn, do you, Ogami? Be careful or Sakura will get jealous.
Would you look at that… you don't let anything burn, do you, Ogami? Be careful or Sumire will get jealous.
Would you look at that… you don't let anything burn, do you, Ogami? Be careful or Maria will get jealous.
Would you look at that… you don't let anything burn, do you, Ogami? Be careful or Kanna will get jealous.
Would you look at that… you don't let anything burn, do you, Ogami? Be careful or Iris will get jealous.
Would you look at that… you don't let anything burn, do you, Ogami? Be careful or Kohran will get jealous.
Ah, Kohran! You have returned from the Flower Mansion I see.
Maria! You really DO look good in men's clothing.
Boss here is showing me to my room.
Is that so? That is good to hear lieutenant.
(What wonderful platinum blonde hair she has.)
(Maybe it is because she knows Kohran from before, but there is a warmth in her eyes I see for the first time.)
(… If I keep staring like that, she'll get angry.)
Hey boss, don't gape at women like that!
… Lieutenant. I think I already told you that you shouldn't stare at women in such a manner.
Gotta listen to what people say, boss. You deserved that one.
Hey boss, don't gape at women like that!
That outfit is awesome. What role are playing?
A French soldier named Andre.n
(But man, she really does look great in men's clothing.)
…Lieutenant. Where do you think are you going with Kohran?
Lieutenant. Have a good day.
I need to be at the stage and prepare for the show. Thank you for your hard work.
As a leader, that goes without saying. <br> As a man, that goes without saying.
As a leader that goes without saying. I'm only bringing her to her room after all.
Oh I don't think that's the case, sir. I don't think all leaders are quite as considerate as you.
She's right boss! You are helping me a great deal here.
As a man that goes without saying. If I see a woman in need I simply have to help her.
Stop it, You'll make me blush I'm not used to being treated like this.
But… it does make me kind of happy.
……
…..Boss, you know you gotta say something, otherwise it isn't much of a conversation.
Oh…sorry… my mind wandered off there for a bit.
… I'm really sorry, Kohran, but the show is about to start very soon.
When you're ready just come to the dressing room. I'll go ahead.
What! Is it really that late, already? I can't be late for my very first show.
Huh, you'll participate in the show, even though you just arrived?n
Don't worry. I've been a member of the Flower Squad for a while now. I'm used to making stuff up as I go.
And besides, I only have a small role with barely any lines. Easy peasy!
Anyway. Thanks for showing me the way. boss. See you later
So… looks like the Flower Squad just got reinforcements. I can't wait to see Kohran in action.
Lieutenant~!
That voice…
Ah, Sumire!
Lieutenant, wasn't that Kohran just now?
Yes. I just brought her…
Did you now? Well, she did just arrive after all.
So lieutenant, now that you have met her, what is your first impression?
She's a bit strange. <br> She's cute! <br> I think she's funny.
Well… what can I say? She's a bit strange.
You read people like books, don't you, lieutenant?
I guess she really is a strange one. Her speech could use some refinement, and some of her inventions can be a bit dangerous.
But she really knows a lot about machines. You can count on her in that regard.
… She's cute, wouldn't you say?
Cute? Kohran?
Well… What can I say. it really isn't my place to judge peoples taste.
Hmm… I think she is funny.
That is certainly true. That speech of her could use some refinement, though.
She was born in China, you would think they would have taught her some manners there.
But noooo, she just says whatever comes to her mind.
Anyway, lieutenant. The manager sent me to tell you that you should go help in the administrations office.
So, now that I delivered that message I have to get going. Please excuse me.
….Now that she mentions it… I DID offer to help earlier. Guess I have to go then.
So… looks like the Flower Squad just got reinforcements. I can't wait to see Kohran in action.
Uncle Ichi~!n
Hm, that voice…?
Uncle Ichi! Wasn't that Kohran?
Yes. I just brought her to her room.
Yay! So she really is back!
What do you think, uncle? Do you like her?n
Of course! <br> Hard to say. <br> She's a terrible person!
Of course. She's really funny.
That's wonderful! I like her a lot, too.
But, before I forget. Uncle Yoneda said you should help out in the administration office.
Gotta go! See you later, uncle!
Hard to say. I just met her after all.
… I see. But I'm sure you'll get to know her soon!
Of course.
But, before I forget. Uncle Yoneda said you should help out in the administration office.
Gotta go! See you later, uncle!
She's a terrible person. I don't see us getting along at all.
What? How can you say that!?
I'm sorry. I didn't mean it. I'll do my best to like her. Please stop crying…
Okay… Promise you'll try!
But before I forget. Uncle Yoneda said you should help out in the administration office.n
Gotta go! See you later, uncle!
……
Did you hear me, Uncle?
Yes… I heard you…
… Uncle Yoneda said that you should go and help in the administration office.
Gotta go! See you later, uncle!n
… I guess I DID promise to help… I better go the administration office, then.
Ah, Ogami.
Okay, I'm here, what do you want me to do?
You see those files? They need sorting.
Got it? I leave you to it then.
Phew! This is such a relief. Now I can go home without having to worry.
… huh?
Since we had the early shift today, Yoneda said we should leave the paperwork to you.
What?!
Thank you very much, Ogami!
Wait a sec…
First the ticket punching and now this…
Am I really the commander here?
Lately I'm start to doubt myself…
Come forth, Four Lords of Death…!
We are gathered here before you…
How may we be of service?
What was the meaning of that debacle, you imbeciles?!
Well, a mysterious group called the Imperial Combat Revue thwarted our plans…
I do not want excuses!
Our apologies, Master Tenkai…
The fact is they are quite skilled…
Silence, Satan! We are supposed to be invincible!
I've devised a way to destroy the barrier around Teito! …A spell called the "Six Fallen Stars."
Complete this spell and destroy all of Teito! Your first target shall be Shiba Park!
Ha~!
Wait! This time I shall come along. I'm sure you would like to watch me fight.
Don't you agree, Satan?
Of course…
Hmph! Your days are numbered, you old fool…
Eeeeeek!!
Cough, cough…Um…This is the Imperial Theater, right?
Cough…Awww…My steambike is totaled…
The name's Kohran Li. Starting today, I've transferred from the Imperial Assault Garden Branch to Ginza Headquarters.
Yoneda! Yoneda, where are you?!
No sweat! I'll go by myself!
Augh! My face is up here, yanno!
The steam bike I invented boasts 4 cylinders and 5 valves! It runs at 100 horsepower and 200 km per hour!
Does that sound like a mess to you?! You better watch yourself, buddy…
Or I'm gonna knock your block off!
As long as you get it, we're cool! I'm Kohran Li, scientific genius.
I'll be living here from now on. Nice to meetcha!
Anyways, who are you?
Ho, I guess that makes you my boss…
I humbly introduce myself as Kohran Li, just transferred from the Garden Branch to Ginza Headquarters!
Please direct me to Lieutenant General Yoneda, sir!
Much obliged, Ensign Ogami…
No sweat! I'll find him myself!
Are you a Koubu pilot, too?
They're complex machines, and typically only girls have the spiritual energy to pilot them.
It's rare to see a guy pilot one. You must be a real hot shot!
By the way, the Hive of Darkness is made up of remnants of the Tokugawa regime who wanna overthrow the government.
We've got to stop them.
Come in!
Welcome to our shop. Good morning! What can I do for you?
How do you do? I'm Tsubaki Takamura. It's a pleasure to meet you, Ogami!
Ah, Ogami, welcome! What can I do for you?
I hope I was able to be of service. Thank you very much for coming by!
Andre, my love! Please…run away with me.
Were I to abandon my duty and men to run away with you… I would be a different man.
Would you still love me then?
Oh, Andre!
Grrrr! Arrrrgh!
Hello there. You're Ogami, right? I'm Yuri Sakakibara!
I do the theater's office work. I'm looking forward to working with you!
Oh my, did you come by to see me? Hee hee, only teasing you!
Do you need me for anything?
I hope I was able to be of service.
It's nice to meet you, Ogami. I'm Kasumi Fujii.
I'm the theater's office work manager.
Do you need something?
Good work today.
Look, it's still swollen. Let me give it a lick for you one more time.
No need to be embarrassed!
How is it…?
Doing your best is all well and good but take it easy OK…?
Wow, looks like you were having heaps of fun, huh?
Lucky you, she almost looked like your girlfriend.
Is that so… Well then…
Hey now… Are you OK?
Ok you say… But you're bleeding aren't you? Let me take a look.
She's so… pretty. That girl… I wonder who she is. …*sigh*.
Ogling and fawning over girls is really disrespectful you know…
Hey, that's so rude! Since when did I act like your wife!?
You're the worst!

Thank you for your hard work.
This is the Deputy Commander of the Imperial Combat Revue, and chief of the Hanayashiki Branch.
I'm Ayame Fujieda. I'm pleased to meet you, Ogami.
A captain must be able to make judgments in an instant. I have high hopes for you. Good luck.
Ahhh…
Cursed Imperial Assault Force! Defiant to the last I see!
In that case, I, Tenkai, shall show you the meaning of true terror!!
Lords of Death!!
Annihilate Teito!! Destroy… the Imperial Assault Force!!
Destroy! Destroy! Destroy!
How is it…?
Doing your best is all well and good but take it easy OK…?
No worries! I always carry a repair kit with me just in case!
I'll have it fixed in a jiffy!
By the way, Ensign. You went up against the Hive of Darkness, right?
How'd it feel?
Heh! You've got guts! I like that.
Don't get too cocky, though. We don't know what'll happen next.
Really? I appreciate your honesty, Ensign. Most people couldn't admit that.
And now that I'm here, you've got nothing to worry about! I'll protect you!
Er, you don't have to talk about it if you don't want to.
After all, everybody's gone through stuff they'd rather forget!
Say no more, say no more.
Just give it all you've got next time, Ensign!
I-is that my photo?! Gee, how embarrassing!
Um, Ensign? I want to go to the Manager's Office…
I'll be on this stage very soon…
Are you sure about this, Ensign?
A captain must be able to make judgments in an instant. I have high hopes for you. Do your best Ogami.
Do your best, Ogami.
Eyaaaah!!
E-ensign!!
Welcome to our shop. Good morning! What can I do for you?
Ah, Ogami, welcome! What can I do for you?
