I have to focus! 
Here I go! 
Leave it to me! 
Watch this, Ogami. 
I'm fine, I can still fight... 
Thank you! 
Keep it up, Ogami! 
I knew I could count on you! 
Aaaahhhh... 
Ngh, I'll show you next time! 
Ogami... I'm so sorry... 
This is my cue. 
Hahaha! 
Let us begin! 
Today's performance is all for you! 
I won't lose to such a trifle... 
Ensign, so you really do care for me... 
Come, Ensign, it's your move! 
I will be watching you! 
Waaahhhh! 
I suppose I'll let you win for now! 
The commander needs me!! 
I'll have to take down the enemies myself! 
Where is our next objective?! 
If you wish to die, then step forward... 
Please relay your orders! 
I'm not finished yet!! Not yet!! 
You would go that far... for my sake... 
Focus, sir! 
Captain, let's make it through this and go home! 
Aaaaagggghh... 
S-such power! Retreat! 
Forgive me, Captain. I must retreat! 
I can fight too! 
Here I goooo! 
I'm super strong! 
I'll try my hardest for you, Uncle Ichi! 
Uh, some of these lights are flashing... 
I love you sooo much, Uncle Ichi! 
Fight, Uncle Ichi! 
I'll be watching! 
Eeeeek.... 
Stupid... stars... 
Uncle Ichi, I'm sorry... 
Gonna go all out. 
You better not underestimate the power of science! 
Movin' out!! 
Get a load of this! 
I'm takin' too much damage here! 
Now that's impressive! 
I'm rootin' for ya! 
Hang in there, Ogami! 
Waaaahhhh... 
Aww, shoot...I've broken down... 
Sorry to be such a pain in the rear, Chief... 
All right! Let's do this thing! 
I'm gettin' pumped up! Hrrraaahhh! 
Have a look at the secret techniques of the Kirishima style! 
All right! Let's do this, Boss! 
No worries! I'm still kickin'! 
Thanks for the help! 
Let's go, Boss! 
Show me yer guns, Boss! 
Uuurrghhh... 
Ugh, my training wasn't enough... 
I gotta keep fighting, for the Boss's sake... 
Aww yes! 
Yes! 
You're finished! 
Hah! 
Got 'em! 
Yaay! Yaaay! 
Kaaaaaahhhh! 
I suppose you deserve some praise for making it this far. 
Stop right there! 
Hahaha!! It's a bit premature to declare yourself the victor!! 
I think you may be mistaken. 
Hold it right there!! 
Now hold on there! Did ya forget about us? 
Oh we'll just see about that. 
Aaaarrrrgghhhhh! 
Heh heh heh...the battle is only beginning, Imperial Combat Revue! 
What did you say?! 
O Great Ones who rule over the demon realm! 
Bestow upon me the power to turn greenery to ash, to split the earth...to rend the sky above! 
Behold...my powerrrrr! 
How...how could this be...?! 
Yeaargghh! 
How magnificent! My entire being overflows with unmitigated power! 
And now, it's my turn! Have at you! Raaaaauuughhh! 
Love...justice...you waste your time upholding such phony sentiments! 
I won't be defeated by you fools who have forgotten what lurks in the depths of the human heart! 
Uncle Ichi?! 
Uncle Ichiiiiii! 
Captain?! 
Captain Ogamiiii! 
Hey, Chief?! 
Ogamiiii! 
Ensign?! 
Ensign Ogamiiii! 
Boss!? 
Ogami!! 
Captain! 
Ogamiiii! 
Yaaaahhhh!! 
We did it! 
Nuuuguuuoooooo!? How can this be!? One such as I, chosen by the Earth, defeated by peasants! 
Guh... it cannot be... I will not accept this... tell me, how could this happen! 
Wh... why!? Has the Earth forsaken me?? 
You're one hundred years too early... 
...to face ME! 
You're one thousand years too early... 
Such insolence! 
It's the head of the Hive of Darkness...Tenkai! 
For the capital...no, on behalf of everything good that resides on this earth... 
...your vile existence ends here! 
It's over... 
...!! 
What in the world?! 
Everyone... you're safe! 
Use this chance to heal, now! 
Heal yourselves now, while you've got the chance! 
Hurry, use this chance to heal! 
Everybody, heal now while you can! 
Better heal up while you've got the chance! 
Heal yerselves up, now!

Tenkai mainly uses penetrating attacks, so we should avoid lining up for him. 
If we can't get out of the way of his magic, we'll just have to strengthen our defenses and endure it! 
We don't have the numbers for a long battle. We should pull out our best techniques and take him down as quickly as possible!! 
Tenkai's special attack has a wide area of effect. We need to be careful when his Willpower is full. 
What a tremendous, unearthly aura! This is bad...if we keep fighting at our current strength... 
Untranslated 
Raaaaggghhh! 
Damn you, you think I'll let you revive yourself?! 
I'll erase him... I'll rid this world of every last trace of Tenkai!! 
Tenkai! Behold the power of pure justice!! 
Guhhh... you fight in vain. I shall revive again... I shall return as many times as it takes...!

Everyone should be fine without me protecting them.

Sumire... I will always protect you. 
Maria... let me watch your back. 
I'll always protect you, Iris. 
I'll protect you, Kohran! Don't worry! 
Kanna! You can count on me to defend you! 
Satan! Where is Satan?! Where could he have gone at a time like this!?
