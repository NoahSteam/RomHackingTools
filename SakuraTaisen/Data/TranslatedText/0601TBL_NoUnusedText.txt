(…If you look closely, she's still wearing her stage hairdo.) 
(…She must have come here in a big hurry after the play ended.) 
(As always, that's some wild hair.) 
(It's Kanna's trademark headband. It always looks so good on her.) 
(I've heard that the store even sells "Kanna's headbands" marketed to children.) 
(Wow… You don't usually see Kanna looking like this.) 
(I wonder what happened here…? Kanna's got a troubled look in her eyes.) 
(I wonder if she ran out of time… Her clothes are all over the place.) 
(Why was Kanna in such a rush?) 
(Oho?! Maybe it's my imagination, but it seems like I can see more than usual…) 
(No! I can't believe I'm staring at Kanna's chest when she's in trouble…What am I doing?!) 
(O-oh nooo! My eyes are drawn like a magnet to her breasts!) 
Captain… What exactly are you lookin' at?! 
That window goes out to the back of the theater. You can see Yaesu and Nihonbashi in the distance. 
There are a lot of books here. From economy to military tactics, recipes, novels and children's books. 
Ahh, it's nice and sunny today, but it'd be nice to relax here even on a rainy day. 
Phew… coming back to your room after a job well done feels good. 
…nothing going on here either. I should try and meet up with everyone else. 
Huh… I wonder if Sakura is in her room. 
Why don't I go check somewhere else. 
…It seems she isn't here. Didn't everyone say they were getting together today? 
Hmm… I wonder if Kanna is in her room? 
Why don't I go check somewhere else? 
…Seems like she's not here. I guess she hasn't returned to her room yet. 
Hmm… I wonder if Maria is in her room? 
Why don't I go check elsewhere? 
…Seems like she's not here. I guess she hasn't returned to her room yet. 
I wonder if Iris is on her way back… 
Okay, guess I'll head somewhere else. 
Damn. Seems there's no one here. 
I wonder if Sumire is inside. 
No sense standing around here. I should get going. 
…Seems there's no one here. 
This room is kind of useless now, isn't it? 
Nobody here either. Off to somewhere else. 
The room is full of costumes. 
But… there's no one here. I'll go check somewhere else. 
Sumire still isn't here. Everyone said they would gather in the parlor but…. 
Not much I can do about it. I'll be leaving. 
No matter when I come here it's always a disaster. 
There was no reason to come here. I'll go elsewhere. 
All the sets from the performance are stored away here… 
Nobody here. I'll be going then. 
In summertime, we have to be all the more careful to keep the galley in sanitary condition. 
…or at least, I can't help but feel that way. I'll head somewhere else. 
It's always lively when a performance is going, but it's quiet now that we're closed. 
There was no reason to come here. I'll go elsewhere. 
I'm finally free from my ticketing duties now that the show is over. 
I guess I'll rest my weary bones today. 
Even the regular customers came and greeted me. 
I wonder if that means I've finally become accustomed to this place… 
Even after the curtain falls and last of the audience has left, I can still feel the enthusiasm of the stage… 
What is everyone doing, I wonder. They must have gathered in the parlor by now. 
There's nobody here. The performance has already ended but no one's come yet. 
Nothing to do here. I'll check somewhere else. 
I can still feel the energy from the performance in the air. 
I guess it's about time to go. 
Even in the afternoon this storage room is pretty dark… 
Nothing to do here either. I suppose I'll check elsewhere. 
The show is almost finished so it makes sense that no one's practicing here. 
… I guess I'll go somewhere else. 
Nothing beats a good swim in the summer. I figured someone might be swimming here… 
Nothing going on here. I'll try to check another room. 
The Koubu are in excellent condition, all thanks to Kohran. 
Kohran is usually here… Oh well, I'll check somewhere else. 
There's no one here… 
Should I check another room? I came here kind of absentmindedly. 
It seems like Iris was taking a shower until just a moment ago. 
There was no reason to come here. I'll go elsewhere. 
I've heard these medical pods can move using the underground steam engine if the situation calls for it… 
… I just pray we won't ever need to use them… 
The backbone of the Imperial Combat Revue during a crisis: the Control Room. When the alarm sounds, we all gather here. 
But… there's no one here. I'll check another room. 
I guess there's only a few of these steam processors in Japan. It's an amazing machine. 
My body feels tense just from coming here. And I'm supposed to be a soldier…? 
Nobody here. Off to somewhere else. 
Oh, are you done? 
Oh, are you done? 
Ogami, I appreciate your interest, but… 
These photos are mainly for guests, so please just take one. 
Oh, I guess that's true. I'll come again some other time. 
You'd like to buy this photo? Thank you!

We need to leave some for the guests, so just take one for now, okay?

Most of the guys buying Iris's photo are older gentlemen. 
They always glance around nervously when they buy it. I wonder if they're worried what people will think?

Hmm… Kohran's fanbase is a bit of a mystery. 
Phew… The Flower Division's summer performance of "Journey to the West" is finally over. 
Since the incident at Fukagawa, Sumire and Kanna's performances have really been in tune with each other. 
There were a ton of patrons today because the play's run is ending, so ticket punching was especially taxing. 
Ahhhhh, I'm beat. Anyway, what should I do now? 
Speak with Tsubaki. <br> Go back to my room. <br> Go meet up with everyone. 
I'll chat with Tsubaki, since I'm done with work for today. 
Ah, Ogami! Great work today. Will you be finishing soon? 
Yup, I'll be leaving soon. 
Thanks for your hard work todaaaay! 
(No matter when I see her, Tsubaki is always so energetic) 
What's wrong Ogami? You were staring at me a little… 
(Tsubaki is always energetic, isn't she? She doesn't seem even a little tired.) 
Are you all right, Ogami? You look a little dazed. Aren't you tired? 
I'm done with work, but you're still here, eh, Tsubaki? 
Yep. We have to see out the customers. This is the busiest time of the night! 
That's true… Well then, I'll get out of your hair. 
Go back to your room. <br> Invite Tsubaki to eat with you. <br> Meet up with everyone. 
Well then, I'll be heading out. 
Thanks for all your hard work! Oh, and everyone from the Flower Division should be in the parlor! 
Everyone gave their all in today's performance, so please give them some kind words, okay? 
I'll do that. Anyway, keep up the good work. 
Eh! Really?! Ah… well… what should I do…? 
What's wrong? 
Actually… I had promised Kasumi that I would go eat with her at Renga. 
Oh really… Well, if you've got a prior engagement then there's nothing we can do about it. 
I'm very sorry! I've already made plans this time, but please invite me out again soon! 
Alright… next time it is! Well, I'll be going then. 
It's a promise, then! And again, thank you for your hard work today! 
If that's all, I'm heading home. 
Thanks for all your hard work! Oh, and everyone from the Flower Division should be in the parlor! 
Everyone gave their all in today's performance, so please give them some kind words, okay? 
I'll do that. Anyway, keep up the good work. 
What's wrong Ogami? You look a little out of it. 
Hey, Miss! Give me that picture! 
Yes, welcome! Kanna Kirishima's picture, right? That'll be 50 zeni please! 
We'll be performing a new show in the fall, so please come see us again! 
You look busy… I'll head out now. Keep up the hard work, ok? 
Of course. Thank you for working hard as well. 
Phew… I'm beat. I'll go back to my room and take a rest. 
Alright, I guess I should meet up with everyone and at least show my face. 
Everyone should be relaxing near the parlor after they finish changing. 
Ahh… no good… I'm really sleepy all of a sudden. 
I'm all done clipping tickets for now, so I'll head out. 
Well, you're surprisingly close to Tsubaki, aren't you Ogami?! 
Huh!? S-Sakura! W-when did you get here!? 
Hmph! I had just come here to look for you. 
Looking for… m-me…? 
After the summer performance finished, we were planning to have an after party with everyone from the Flower Brigade, but… 
…I'll just have to tell everyone that you'll be absent due to your dinner with Tsubaki! 
Hey! W-wait a minute! 
She didn't accept my invitation anyway! <br> That was just a joke! <br> Hey, listen to me for a second! 
She didn't accept my invitation. She had already made other plans… 
So if she hadn't made plans in advance, then you'd be going to eat with her? I can't believe it! 
You can't believe it? It's just going for dinner… 
That doesn't matter! And to think I came here to invite you to the after party… I'll be taking my leave! 
Oh… she's gone. She came here just to ask me to join her, and now this… what a bummer. 
Oh, that was just a joke! I wasn't being serious. 
I didn't take you for the type to invite girls out as a joke! 
Well, I came here to invite you to the after party but… Just kidding! I'll be taking my leave. 
Oh… she's gone. She came here just to ask me to join her, and now this…what a bummer. 
Sakura! Please wait! Just listen to me for a minute. 
What is it? What did you want to tell me? 
Tsubaki was quite busy during the closing ceremonies today, right? I just thought it would be nice to treat her to dinner. 
Then that's when you called me. This isn't a fib or a joke… I'm being serious. 
I understand. I can believe that. 
You're so kind, Ogami. But sometimes… that kindness… 
Hmm? My kindness…? 
No, no. It's nothing. Anyway… 
Since our summer performance is over, we're having a big after party with everyone! 
Please come and at least show your face. 
Thank you, of course I'll go. Where is everyone meeting? 
Everyone is resting in the parlor now. Anyway, I'll be going. 
(Right, the after party…Regardless, I'm glad I was able to avoid a fight with Sakura.) 
… 
What is it? If you don't have anything to say to me, then please don't call after me! 
…I'll be taking my leave. 
Ah! She left. I guess I made her angry… What a bummer. 
I'll have to apologize later. 
Uncle Ichi!! You came to peep at me, didn't you!? 
I don't have any ulterior motives or anything! <br> …I've been caught. <br> I was just worried so I came to check up on you! 
You're mistaken! I don't have any ulterior motives or anything like that! 
Liar! Uncle Ichi is dirty! 
D-dirty? 
Pervert! 
Degenerate! 
What are you saying? And why do you know that word?! 
I-I dunno! 
Ah! Iris! …She left…Well, that's a shame. 
…I've been caught, have I? Oh well, what can you do, ahahaha… 
Grrrrrrr! Uncle Ichi is such an idiot! Pervert! Dirty old man! I can't believe this! 
Uggh! Get out of here! 
Are you kidding me? This is the second time this has happened! This is too much. 
Yikes! It looks like Iris teleported me here. 
I was worried about you, Iris. 
…!? 
I was passing by the changing rooms and heard you screaming… 
I was worried that something had happened, so I ran here as quickly as I could. 
…Reeeeally? 
Really. 
REALLY really? 
Really really. 
Aww! I believe you! 
(Phew…) 
But… Uncle Ichi. You're lucky it was me… if it were someone else, then…. 
They might've been super duper mad! Be careful, okay? 
Anyway, I'm gonna go meet up with everyone else! Bye~Bye~! 
S-she's right… I'd better be careful. 
… 
Uncle Ichi… Don't make that face! 
I'm not angry, okay? 
I'm sorry, Iris. It was a little careless of me to run in here like that. 
No, no, it's okay, Uncle Ichi. 
Anyway, I'm gonna go meet up with everyone else! Bye~Bye~! 
I'm sorry I made you worry, Uncle Ichi. 
It's okay, really. I just heard your screams and thought something might've happened to you. 
Honestly, I'm just glad it wasn't anything serious. 
Actually, I was a little surprised when I heard your voice but… 
I'm so happy that you would worry about me like that! 
Hahaha. Next time make sure you don't mix up the hot and cold water, ok? 
Okaaaay! Anyway, I'm gonna go meet up with everyone else! 
Hey, come on! I'm totally innocent! 
Ahhh, that was refreshing! Huh? Uncle Ichi, what's wrong? 
I should be asking you that. I was walking through the corridor and heard quite the scream coming from your room. 
….Huh? Ohhhh… 
I mixed up the hot and cold water, so I shouted… Maybe that's what you heard? 
Are you kidding me? I'm glad I didn't rush in here. 
I think you just wanted to come into my room, isn't that right? 
That's not it at all. <br> …You're right. <br> I'll leave it up to your imagination. 
That's not it at all. I wasn't trying to catch a peek or anything. 
Uncle Ichi… 
W-what?! Hold on a second… Why are you mad, Iris? 
Hmph! You don't want to see me naked! Isn't that right? 
Well… Uh… 
Hmph! Stupid Uncle Ichi! 
Phew. She left but…why was she mad at me?! 
Well if I'm being honest… I wanted to take a peek. 
Hehehe! I knew it! Uncle Ichi is a pervert! 
…… 
Aww, Uncle Ichi's being shy! How cuuuute! 
Well… Uh… 
Next time…. Let's get in together! Okay, Uncle Ichi? 
…Hey now! 
Anyway, I'm gonna go meet up with everyone else! Bye~Bye~! 
Ahh… this is no good. What am I saying?! 
…I'll leave that to your imagination. 
You were just itching to come to my room, weren't you, Uncle Ichi? 
…… 
See?! I knew it! 
I-Iris! Hold on a second! 
Don't be shy, don't be shy! 
Anyway, I'm gonna go meet up with everyone else! Bye~Bye~! 
I… I can't deny it though… Maybe I did want to sneak in… I'm scaring myself. 
… 
See! You're thinking about it, aren't you? You wanted to sneak a peek! 
N-no, actually… 
It would've be fine if you came in, y'know? 
H-hey! I-Iris! You shouldn't tease adults like that! 
Don't be shy! Don't be shy! 
Anyway, I'm gonna go meet up with everyone else! Bye~Bye~! 
She's right though… I was thinking about it… I'm scaring myself. 
Kyaaaaah!! 
Huh!? That scream… That was Iris! It sounded like it was coming from the changing rooms. 
Hurry to the changing rooms. <br> Shout "What's wrong!?". 
Iris isn't here?! That must mean… the shower room?! 
Damnit… What should I do!? 
Hurry to the shower room. <br> Shout "What's wrong!?". 
Iris isn't here either! Maybe she's in the shower room? Uh-oh… 
The hell with it! I can't just abandon Iris! I'm busting into that shower! 
Iris! Are you alright?! 
Huh?! Oh! Uncle Ichi! Get out of here! 
Huh? What the!? Uwaaaaaah! 
Woah… Apparently I've been teleported here by Iris… 
I wanted to go and help her but… I've been mistaken for a peeping tom… 
Iris! What's wrong!? Are you okay!? 
Huh!? That voice… Uncle Ichi?! Uncle Ichi, what's wrong? 
I heard someone screaming and thought something was wrong! 
Well… uh… I… I thought I would take a shower but I accidentally mixed up the hot and cold water. 
I got super surprised and shouted real loud. 
Are you kidding? That's it…? I was more surprised than you were! 
I'm sorry, Uncle Ichi. Were you worried about me~? 
Of course I was! 
Reeeally…? Hehehe, I'm happy. 
Well, it was nothing after all. I'm glad it was nothing big. 
I was worried about you but… I was a little nervous to enter the shower room. 
First things first, I need to figure out what's going on. 
Iris! What's wrong!? Are you okay!? 
Huh!? That voice… Uncle Ichi?! Uncle Ichi, what's wrong? 
I heard someone screaming and thought something was wrong! 
Well… uh… I… I thought I would take a shower but I accidentally mixed up the hot and cold water. 
I got super surprised and shouted real loud.

I'm sorry, Uncle Ichi. Were you worried about me~? 
Of course! 
Reeeally…? Hehehe, I'm happy. 
Well, it was nothing after all. I'm glad it was nothing big. 
I was worried about you but… I was a little nervous to enter the shower room. 
First things first, I need to figure out what's going on. 
Hey, Boss… 
I feel bad about just leaving Kanna in the lurch, but… guess I'd better go elsewhere. 
What's wrong, Kanna? You have a worried look on your face. 
Well, I've heard that a bunch o' kids tend to get separated from their parents in all the hubbub when people are leaving after the show. 
So I started wondering if I could do anything to help, and I rushed here once the play ended. 
Alright! Let's do it. <br> Kanna… you're so kind. <br> Well, I'm in a bit of a rush so… 
Alright! Let's help these lost kids find their parents! 
Boss! So you'll help me?! 
Well, we can't just leave the poor kids alone, right? 
All right! Having you around is as good as having a hundred average guys! Let's do it! 
…Kanna… You're so kind. 
Hmm? Me… kind? Boss… 
But… back when I was a kid, I once got lost in the forest, so…. 
I understand how lonely those lost kids must be. 
…All right! Let's help these lost kids find their parents! 
Boss! So you'll help me?! 
Well, we can't just leave the poor kids alone, right? 
All right! Having you around is as good as having a hundred average guys! Let's do it! 
I know it's rude but… I'm in a bit of a hurry. 
…Well then. I guess I'll figure something out. 
See you later… 
Boss! You don't look like you're doing anything important. Can you give me a hand with a little something? 
Huh? H-hey, I never said I had nothing to do! 
Aw, come on, don't make such a fuss! These kids are in a pinch, so we should help 'em out! 
I'm no match for you, am I? Got it, I'll help too! 
We've got this! Having you around is as good as having a hundred average guys! Let's do it! 
The play's run is ending today, yeah? Kids keep getting separated from their parents in the crowd. 
Alright! Lets help these lost kids find their parents. 
Yo, Boss! If you're here, that means you came to help me, right? 
I mean… it's not like that, but… 
Boss… You wouldn't leave these poor kids alone, would you? 
W-well…. 
I know you aren't that kind of guy, Boss. Alright! Let's help these kids out. 
…Got it! Let's help them out! 
All right! Having you around is as good as having a hundred average men! Let's do it, Boss! 
Ogami, Kanna! Thank you so very much for helping me today. 
It sure took a while, didn't it? 
Don't worry about that one bit! You two really saved me by helping me out today. 
Exactly, Kanna. Sure it took some time, but at least all the kids were able to find their parents. 
That's true. I'm really grateful for everyone's help. 
As expected from the Boss! Your judgment and memory are fantastic! 
It's nothing, really. I'm just relieved all the kids were able to find their parents. 
I know it well… what it feels like to lose sight of your parents… 
I was left behind, wasn't I? I've gotta stop thinking like that or I'll start crying. 
I don't want the kids who came to see the Flower Division's performance to think something like that. 
Allowing them to come to this theater and make good memories together… That's my most important job. 
Our memories are precious, aren't they? <br> Fighting is an important job too. <br> That's just like you, Kanna. 
Our memories are precious, aren't they? 
Exactly. We can give those kids a dream to work towards. 
Even if bad things happen, they can think back on our performance with a smile on their faces. 
Every time I stand there up on the stage, I always tell myself that that's the kind of performance I wanna show them. 
…or, something. Hope I'm not actin' like a show-off? 
No, not at all. Actually, it was really fantastic. 
Aw, c'mon. I appreciate it, but flattery will get you nowhere. 
Well, I'd better get going, then. Everyone should be in the parlor by now. 
Boss… thank you for helping me. 
That's true. But fighting is still our most important job. 
Of course! Protecting everyone from evil is the the Imperial Revue's most important job! 
Everything that's precious to these kids… their precious people, town, dreams… I'll try to protect it all! 
…or, something. Hope I'm not actin' like a show-off? 
No, not at all. Actually, it was really fantastic. 
Aw, c'mon. I appreciate it, but flattery will get you nowhere. 
Well, I'd better get going, then. Everyone should be in the parlor by now. 
Boss… thank you for helping me. 
That's just like you, Kanna. 
Really? I just figure, I hate feeling lonely… 
Life's a lot better with a smile on your face and a spring in your step! 
Yeah. And that's the kind of place this theater is, at any rate. 
Yep. For my part, I wanna make sure to keep this theater overflowing with smiling faces. 
Well, I'd better get going, then. Everyone should be in the parlor by now. 
Boss… thank you for helping me. 
…or, something. Hope I'm not actin' like a show-off? 
Well, I'd better get going, then. Everyone should be in the parlor by now. 
Boss… thank you for helping me. 
Kanna's performance is always a hit with the kids. No doubt it's the energy and brightness she brings to the stage… 
…but I bet it's also because Kanna just loves kids. 
Oh, Ogami! Kanna! Why don't you let me take care of the kids? 
Dammit! I couldn't get any of those kids back to their parents! 
I should've tried a little harder, myself…I'm sorry, Kanna. 
What're you sayin', Boss? You gave it your best shot, didn't you? 
Yuri'll take over finding their parents from here. She's good at this kind of thing. 
As for me, I'll just be happy to put smiles back on their faces. 
…or, something. Hahaha! A-anyway, I'm gonna head to the parlor. 
Thanks for the help, Boss. 
Kanna's performance is always a hit with the kids. No doubt it's the energy and brightness she brings to the stage… 
…but I bet it's also because Kanna just loves kids. 
Yo, Boss! Looks like we made it through the performance unscathed. 
Nicely done. Playing the lead part couldn't have been easy, either. 
Heheh… thanks. I'm just happy that the kids enjoyed this one. 
Oh! Speaking of kids, I gotta get moving! 
Later, Boss! 
What's got you in such a hurry? <br> …your kids? <br> Well, I'll see you later. 
What's got you in such a hurry? 
Looks like there's some lost kids in the lobby and it's causin' problems for Yuri. I'm gonna go back her up. 
When you say kids… you don't mean… your kids, do you? 
Don't be an idiot! I don't have any kids, okay!? 
Looks like there's some lost kids in the lobby and it's causin' problems for Yuri. I'm gonna go back her up. 
Give it your all, okay? <br> Well, I'll see you later. <br> Is it alright if I give you a hand, then? 
Oh really? That seems tough… Well, be sure to give it your all! 
I will. Those kids came out here to see our performance, so I can't just abandon them. 
I'll see ya later, Boss! If you get a minute, I'd appreciate your help in the lobby! 
That's Kanna for you. Always ready to help. 
The fact that she's so kind and dependable must be why the kids love her. 
Hmm, really… well, I'll see you later. 
…Tch! That's cold, Boss. If you've really got nothing to do, can't you gimme a hand? 
Hmph!! Well then, Boss… 
(That might've been a little harsh of me.) 
Is it alright if I give you a hand, then? I'm not really doing anything now… 
Really?! Thanks for for helping me out, Boss. Alright, let's head to the lobby! 
…… 
Boss! You don't look like you're doing anything important. Can you give me a hand with a little something? 
Huh? H-hey, I never said I had nothing to do! 
Aw, come on, don't make such a fuss! These kids are in a pinch, so we should help 'em out! 
I'm no match for you, am I? Got it, I'll help too! 
That's more like it! Right, let's get over to the lobby! 
Hmm… I'm not really sure but… I'll see you later. 
Alright. Later then, Boss! 
I'm in a bit of a rush, so I'll catch you later! 
Hey, Kanna! …The play just ended, where's she going in such a hurry? 
Oh, Ogami! Nice work today. 
Hey, Sakura. Today was rough, what with so many customers! 
Well, today was the last run of our summer play. By the way, about that… 
Everyone should be gathering in the parlor by now. 
If you don't mind, Ogami… Would you please come with me? 
Sure, I'll come along. <br> I've got something to attend to…I'm sorry. <br> I can go on my own. 
Sure, I'll come along. Let's go. 
Okay! It looks like coming to get you was a good idea after all. 
Oh? Sakura… did you come here just to get me? 
Huh?! I just figured that you'd be tired from work is all… 
…Thank you, Sakura. 
I-it's nothing, really. S-should we get going Ogami? 
Come on!! Don't be like this! Everyone's already waiting, so let's hurry up and go! 
Ah, Sakura! Could you stop pulling my hand?! 
Heheh, if you're not going, then I'll just have to pull you all the way to the parlor! 
I really do appreciate the invitation but… I have something I really need to do…I'll definitely come by a little later. 
…is that so? I understand. Well, everyone is already in the parlor, so please stop by, okay? 
…I'm holding you to that, Ogami! 
Everyone's meeting in the parlor, eh? I should try and show my face later on. 
The parlor, right? Alright, I'll head over by myself. 
…is that so?! Even though I came here just to invite you down?! 
Fine, Ogami. Go by yourself for all I care! …I'm leaving! 
Uh-oh… I made her angry, didn't I? 
Hey, Sumire. What's with that sullen face of yours? 
Ensign… I'm in something of a rotten mood at the moment. 
About Kanna? <br> About the play? <br> About me? 
I suppose… it's about Kanna, right? 
…Yes. You're quite perceptive. 
I thought you two had made peace with each other recently? 
This is an issue I have with the casting. It's a completely separate matter. 
How on earth could Kanna be cast as the lead, and I as the villain?! 
I suppose… it's about the play, right? 
That's exactly it! Perceptive as always, Ensign. That saves me the need to explain! 
Curse Yoneda, that crusty old man! He's been casting me in nothing but supporting roles as of late… 
It's as though he has no eye for talent whatsoever! 
How dare he! <br> I don't think that's true. 
How dare he! Someone of your talents ought to be given better roles. 
…… 
What's the matter, Sumire? 
It's just… your sentiments have made me quite happy. 
But it would be unbecoming of me to accept pity from others. 
It's extremely embarrassing that you have seen me in such a pathetic state. 
Sumire… 
If I want to remain at the top I have to stop complaining. 
Ensign… I do appreciate you taking the time to speak with me. 
Thanks to you, the path I must walk has become clear to me. Well then, please excuse me. 
I don't think that's true. 
What was that, Ensign? Whatever do you mean? 
This may sound patronizing coming from someone who knows next to nothing about theater, but… 
No matter how good the lead actor is, you couldn't put on a play without a supporting cast. 
The villainess is a splendid role to perform. And I don't think there's anyone who could pull it off better than you, Sumire. 
Ensign… you've made your point quite well. 
I was mistaken. A splendid supporting role… it's just as you said. 
And someone who excels at playing supporting roles is the real power on the stage! 
That's right! Exactly what I wanted to say. 
Thank you so very much, Ensign. Speaking with you has lifted my spirits. 
Well then, I will make my way to the parlor. Please do drop by later. 
…I wonder if my advice was of any use? 
… 
What is it, Ensign? Don't just stand there and say nothing! 
Well, I know next to nothing about theater… and I wasn't sure whether I should butt in… 
…I'm sorry that I bothered you with my complaints, Ensign. 
But, well… I loved you as the villainess, Sumire. It was very… you. 
Is… is that so? 
Indeed, complaining about the role I was cast is unbefitting of a star actress like myself. 
Thank you so very much, Ensign. Speaking with you has lifted my spirits. 
Well then, I will make my way to the parlor. Please do drop by later. 
…I wonder if my advice was of any use? 
… 
What is it, Ensign? You turned silent all of a sudden. 
Well, I suppose my ill temper has nothing to do with you. 
Please do excuse me. 
…I was just wondering why I always end up getting the short end of the stick! 
…So you're upset about role distribution for the shows? 
Oh, Ensign… It's not as if I'm angry at YOU or anything. 
After all, we two are friends, right? 
Of… of course. 
…It's true I was a tiny bit unhappy with the roles I've been getting lately… 
But I shouldn't bother you with my complaints. …Please excuse me. 
So your are unhappy with your roles? Sounds like it's complicated… 
Aren't you a little too self-conscious? 
Oh, erm… So I was wrong? Hahaha… 
I see, I have ruined the mood. Please excuse me, I'll go ahead. 
Hmmm… I wonder what that was all about. 
I was really surprised earlier seeing that side of Maria… 
Ahh! Ma….Maria!? 
Lieutenant! I… 
(Oh… that costume. Where did I see that before…?) 
(Could it be… isn't that the costume that Sakura wore for her role of the French city girl?) 
Lieutenant… this is… 
(Maria seems uncharacteristically nervous.) 
(She's not as intimidating as usual. I guess underneath it all she's just a normal girl.) 
(She looks flustered…) 
(I've never seen her this anxious before…) 
Captain…please don't look at me like that. 
I-I'm sorry! It's my fault… I shouldn't have entered the women's changing room in the first place. 
A gentleman as always, I see. I am grateful for your sincere apology. 
But… I mean… It's really me who is to blame. 
I was just sorting through the costumes when Sakura's fell into my hands. 
It looked so cute and… well… I just… 
That was unprofessional of me. Please forget about this. 
I understand, it's all right. 
Lieutenant… please, do not speak of this to anyone. Promise me. 
W-well then… I'll take my leave. 
Alright, I'll see you later. 
Who'd have thought Maria would ever act like that? 
So underneath that exterior, she's just a girl after all. 
Maria… What are you doing? 
Lieutenant… I was sorting the costumes and I came across this… 
And then, well… 
This is a really cute dress, so I… 
It really suits you. <br> You startled me. <br> It's a bit small… 
It really suits you. 
L-Lieutenant, please don't tease me like that! 
I'm not joking around at all. You are a woman after all, you should dress like this more often. 
What? No… Things like this don't suit me at all. 
Nonsense! You are really beautiful and should dress up a little more often! 
…I'm just not used to… 
You startled me, Maria. 
I-I'm sorry to have caught you off-guard… 
It's fine, you really don't need to apologize. You're a girl after all. 
But how… 
You're beautiful, Maria… so… you look fantastic wearing those girly clothes. 
…Is that so? It's hard for me to tell, so… 
It's a little small on you but… 
You're right…These girly clothes don't really suit me at all, do they? 
I think your normal appearance suits you best after all. 
I-is that so? You're right… 
…… 
Umm… Captain…? 
Ah… I was staring… Maria, those clothes really suit you, don't they? 
That's… Don't tease me like that, Captain… 
I wasn't teasing you. You're beautiful, Maria. You should wear feminine clothes more often. 
That's impossible for me. Besides, the patrons all expect me to dress like a man, right? 
Really? Well, there certainly isn't anyone that plays the male roles as good as you do. 
No… that's not what I mean… 
Well then… Lieutenant… 
…What is it, Maria? 
You won't tell anyone else about this, will you? 
Hmmm, but what if I did? <br> It's our secret. <br> This will make for some good gossip! 
Hmmm, but what if I did? 
C-Captain!! 
It was a joke! Just a joke. I'll keep this a secret. 
I'd be happy if you would. 
Alright… then it'll be just between the two of us. 
…Thank you. I just got carried away a bit after the show. 
Well, I think getting carried away might actually be good for you. Relax a little. 
Really…? Hehe, maybe you are right. 
This will make for some good gossip! 
Lieutenant… people with loose lips don't tend to live for very long… 
(Gulp…) 
No, no! Haha. It was just a joke! A joke! 
…… 
…… 
It's ah… It's quite alright, Captain. Please don't worry so much. 
W-well then… I'll take my leave. 
Alright, I'll see you later. 
Who'd have thought Maria would ever act like that? 
So underneath that exterior, she's just a girl after all. 
Kasumi is leading the patrons out of the theater. 
She seems busy, so I won't bother her. 
Oh… it's Kasumi. 
Ogami, nice work today. 
You as well. But…what are you doing here? 
I'm escorting the guests to the exit. 
We've closed off the doors so that the guests don't wander of into the rest of the building. 
Would you be so kind to go through the first floor if you want to go to the second? 
Really? What a bother. 
Haha, Sorry, but we can't have our guests confuse the exits, THAT would be even more bothersome. 
Yes, being a guide to our guests truly is an important responsibility. 
…Okay. I'll go through the first floor to get to the second. Keep up the good work. 
Thank you very much. And thank you for all your hard work today, Ogami. 
Kohran must have gone to the parlor by now. She's not here either. 
This is Kohran's room. 
Who could that be… I'm… a little tied up right now… Hold on… Gimme a sec… 
Open the door anyway. 
….Hmmmm. This wire should go here, right? And…Come on! Get in there! 
Alright, I'm coming in! 
Kohran, what're you up to? 
Shh! …I'm in the middle of making a totally new type of robot… 
I'm trying to connect a really important wire right now… I can't concentrate so… can you stop being so nosy? 
What kind of robot? <br> I'm not going to say a word. <br> You're building noses? 
Wow… What kind of robot? 
Didn't I just tell you to shut your trap for one second?! Aaaah… 
Wh… what's wrong? 
Ah… damn it… 
Don't worry. I'm not gonna say a single word. 
That were nine words just there! Aaah… 
Wh…what's wrong? 
Ah…damn it… 
You're building noses? 
You dim-witted…! What are you talking about?! I said "nosey"! 
Oh, I've just shoved it right in without thinking about it! 
K… Kohran! If you scream like that… 
Ah… damn it… 
…… 
…Thanks a bunch, Ogami. 
At this part of the construction, even the smallest distraction can lead to a grave mistake. 
So, thanks for… Whoa! 
Wh… what's wrong? 
Ah… damn it… 
*cough*…*cough*! 
What the hell! Now "Party Boy" has gone bust! 
A-are you alright, Kohran? 
Noooo! I'd fitted him with a steam processor that could do both sides of a double act routine… 
He was equipped with an arm just for card tricks… had the body of a stripper and the mind of philosopher… 
And now my Party Boy… an entertainment robot built to perform party routines from 12 countries… lies in pieces… 
Didn't I tell you not to distract me?! 
Thanks to you I connected the wrong wire and boom! There he goes! 
S-sorry… 
I slaved away on him for a month! What a mess… I'll go see the others. 
Boss… next time someone tells you to shut up, you better listen. Please, I mean it… 
I'll go and meet up with the others. They're probably in the parlor. You better don't follow me! 
What are you talking about? What is this "Party Boy"? 
Today was the last show of the summer season. And I promised I'd have him ready for the celebrations… 
For an entire month I spent my nights working to create the perfect party trick robot… 
Oh, dear Party Boy… Please forgive me. 
And I was SO close to finishing! I'm such an idiot! 
Kohran… I'm sorry about your robot, but the most important part is that you didn't get hurt… 
If you'd been hurt, there'd be no celebration at all. So, I'm really glad. 
Oh, cut it out… You're gonna make me blush… 
I… I think I better… better go to the parlor… look for the others… 
Oh, and… I'm really sorry you had to witness this disaster… Sorry. 
Nonsense! But… I really would have liked to see Party Boy in action. 
… 
In that case, I'm gonna show you a little secret later. You can look forward to it! 
And off she goes… What the hell did she mean by "secret"? 
I'm coming in, Kohran… 
Kohran… What do you think you're doing? 
O…Ogami!? How long have you been here for? 
Ah…damn it… 
Would you look at this freaking mess! Now my Party Boy's in pieces! 
A-are you alright, Kohran? 
Ogami!! Don't just enter someone else's room like that! 
You made me drop my screwdriver, and now look! This disaster is your fault! 
Sorry, I didn't do it on purpose. <br> Kohran, are you hurt? <br> Party Boy? 
Sorry, I didn't do it on purpose. 
Well, of course not. That would have made it even worse! 
What were you even thinking just coming in here without asking? 
I'm sorry… 
Don't you "Sorry" me! Just look what you did to Party Boy! He's a pile of bolts now! 
There's no way I'll ever be able to fix him again… This is bad. 
Kohran, are you hurt? 
I'm fine. But look! Look what happened to Party Boy… He's in a million pieces! 
I'm sorry… 
Don't you "Sorry" me! We're lucky he was just an entertainment robot. 
If I'd been working on my Spirit Power Bomb, all of Ginza might be gone now. 
"Party Boy"? What's that? 
Hm? You wanna know about Party Boy? 
See these pieces lying around everywhere? That's the most advanced entertainment robot the world would have ever seen. 
Entertainment robot? 
Yes! Glorious bringer of fun and lightener of moods at even the most boring of parties! 
Thanks to his steam processor he was able to simulate both sides of a double act routine… 
Depending on the situation his body was able to transform in sixteen different ways! 
A customized card-trick arm, a family-friendly exotic dance function, and even an automatic tip collector! 
Thanks to my "life of the party" circuitry, his tricks would have become ever wilder! 
And on top of that… 
Okay, okay, I get it! I'm really sorry. 
…Well… maybe I got carried away a bit, but anyway, you need to be more careful! 
… 
… 
Come on, Ogami! You don't have to make such a serious face. 
You can always fix up something that's broken. 
But… really, showing at least a minimum of manners shouldn't be too hard. 
Ahh….I'm really, really sorry. 
From now on, you oughta be careful when entering other people's rooms. Got it, Ogami?! 
Y…yeah. 
Hmph… Well, I promised I'd meet everyone in the parlor, so I'll be going. Later, Ogami. 
I wonder if Ayame is in her room. 
I guess I'll try somewhere else. 
It's Ogami… do you have a moment? 
Oh, Ogami? Come right in. How can I help you? 
Excuse me. 
Ayame! The performance just ended so… 
If you'd like… would you uh… would you want to grab dinner with me or something? 
Oh! You came here to invite me out? Thank you, Ogami. 
I'm happy but… I've still got a report to write. I'm really sorry. 
Anyway, everyone is probably gathering in the parlor by now. 
Please head over there while I quickly finish up this report. I'm sure everyone is waiting for you. 
Oh, Ogami. Welcome. 
Let's talk about something fun. 
Alright. 
Do you need me for anything? 
(She's got her scarf pinned with a brooch.) 
(I wonder what it's made of… Couldn't be a real jewel, right?) 
…are you interested in this brooch? Oh, hey, listen to this, I actually got it super cheap at a bargain sale. 
…… 
(The way Yuri's hair curls away from her face is one of her most charming points…) 
(That bouncy look is pretty trendy.) 
Is something odd about my hair? Oh no~, I've got some split ends! 
(She's got a nice, small face. I think even a model would be jealous…) 
(It doesn't seem like she uses a lot of make-up. Well, she's got such a nice foundation, I don't think she really needs it…) 
What's the matter, Ogami? You're staring at my face… Oh, I see. You've fallen for me, right? 
Hey, you shouldn't tease your elders! 
Hehehe… sorry, Ogami. 
(Her eyes are shining with curiosity.) 
(Yumi's got a reputation for loving juicy gossip…) 
Hey, Ogami. Have you heard any good rumors lately? 
(Her clothes are pretty colorful.) 
Do you like this outfit? It's called the 'bus guide' look. It's really popular right now. 
(Goodness… that's certainly an aggressive neckline…) 
(But… isn't this supposed to be a uniform?) 
Ahaha. I see you've been stricken by my allure, Ogami~! 
Hey, hey! 
Recently, there have been a lot more reports of monster attacks. 
Really? 
Just a while ago there was a report of a cat-sized monster around the Suehirocho depot. 
I just hope this doesn't turn into something really bad… 
After we finish our summer performances, the theater is opened up for public use. 
There will be all sorts of attractions, including a special preview of The Three Musketeers. 
Directed by Fred Niblo and starring Douglas Fairbanks… you should definitely check it out! 
So Ogami, how are things going with Kanna? 
What do you mean? 
I mean something happened between you two at Fukagawa, right? 
No… not really. 
Oh come on, seriously? You guys are no fun! 
Hey now… 
Finally, we're done for the summer! I can't believe I missed the summer festival and the Sumida River fireworks. 
Yeah, summer's almost over… 
I need to get out and buy some new clothing for the fall. I wonder what will be popular this year? 
Sumire hasn't been near the prop room ever since you guys went to Fukagawa. 
Hmm? Why? 
Well think about it. There's all sorts of stuff piled here and there in that room. Seems like the kind of place you'd find… 
Find what? Oh… Oh, I get it. 
Looks like you and Sakura have been hitting it off lately, Ogami. 
Sakura's popular with just about everyone. I think it's because she comes off as nice and approachable. 
Looks like you and Sumire have been hitting it off lately, Ogami. 
Most people see her as hard to approach, but they also feel that's what makes her attractive. 
She's always getting bouquets from young guys from the upper class. 
Ogami, seems like you've been pretty friendly with Maria lately. 
Maria's fans basically fall into two groups. Either they're young students or girls. 
Ogami, seems like you've been pretty friendly with Iris lately. 
It's pretty obvious what makes Iris popular. Most of her fans are older folks. 
Seems like you've gotten pretty close to Kohran lately, huh, Ogami? 
Honestly… I really don't get where Kohran's popularity comes from… 
Seems like you've gotten pretty close to Kanna lately, huh, Ogami? 
Kanna's really popular with children. 
Do you need something? 
(That ribbon in her hair… it really suits her.) 
(I'd say that's an attractive feature to go with Kasumi's mature looks.) 
(Not a hair out of place.) 
(She really does have beautiful hair… she must spend a lot of time getting ready every day.) 
(She's got such a serene expression on her face.) 
(She looks nice, but I bet she's scary if you get her angry… She's kind of the reliable older sister type.) 
…is something the matter, Ogami? 
Oh, no, it's nothing, Kasumi. 
(There's a quiet, calm look in her eyes.) 
(Kasumi always looks people right in the eyes when she talks to them.) 
(Those traditional Japanese clothes look great on her.) 
(Even though she appears relaxed, I can't see any openings in her stance… I wonder if she's had martial training?) 
(Gotta love the chest areas on traditional Japanese clothes…) 
…… 
(She's actually got quite a…) 
Ogami! This is really inappropriate… 
Oh, sorry… 
Thanks for all your hard work, Ogami. 
Hey, you've been working hard too. I'm glad we're finally done with the summer performance. 
It'll be nice to have some time to relax. We'll actually be taking time off starting tomorrow. 
Though it's a little late to call it a summer break. 
The summer performance went over very well. I think the children in particular really enjoyed it. 
My goodness. I'm glad that's finally over. Thanks for all the help, Ogami. 
But we're going to need to start preparation for the next performance right away… 
What are we doing next? 
Sumire's going to star in "Inferno of the Naga". 
She hasn't been the main star for a while, so she's in high spirits. 
So she's going to play a snake woman… I think she'll be pretty popular. 
Good work out there, Ogami. 
Hey, Tsubaki. Thanks. You too. 
We're finally done with the summer performance. There were a ton of kids here today, so it was pretty wild. 
Are you done for the day, Tsubaki? 
Yep, and starting tomorrow I'm taking a few days off. 
Oh, Ogami. Did you need something else? 
(A shopkeeper's outfit. Tsubaki looks good in it.) 
H-hey, Ogami! Where do you think you're looking? Stop! 
Ogami… come on, don't stare at me like that. It's embarrassing. 
Is there something on my face? 
Thanks for your business! Come again! 
Hello? …I see. Thanks for doing that. We've got our processor working on it too. 
I see, so they're wedges… Okay, we'll try running that through our processor. 
The Flower Division? Right now they're throwing a party, I think. They should be fine. 
…yes. We should see some results soon…. thanks… 
I wonder if the manager is around. 
I guess I'll try somewhere else. 
Zzz… zzz… zzz… zzz… 
He's sleeping pretty deeply, he seems peaceful. 
It's Ogami… do you have a moment? 
Oh, Ogami. Yeah, come on in. 
Excuse me. 
Chief, what was that phone call about, just now? 
Huh? Whaddya mean? 
Well… just now… 
What? I wasn't talking on the phone or anything. Are you hearing things? 
Absolutely… 
Hey Ogami. Once the party's over, go buy me some drinks, okay? 
Then bring 'em on down to the control room. I'll pay you back there. 
Uh… okay. 
Alright. Dismissed. 
Yes, sir…. Wait, what? Why the control room? 
Is Ayame around? 
I guess I'll try somewhere else. 
Looks like Ayame isn't back yet. 
Oh, Ogami. Did you need me for something? 
Oh, yes. I wanted to speak with you. 
…I'm afraid I'm a little busy right now. Sorry. 
Dang it. I came here just to talk to her. 
Well, nothing to be done. Let's go somewhere else. 
It's Ogami… do you have a moment? 
Oh, Ogami? Come right in. How can I help you? 
Excuse me. 
Everyone's planning to throw a party, so I was wondering… 
Would you like to go with me? 
You came here just to personally invite me? Why thank you, Ogami. 
I'm flattered, but unfortunately I still have reports I need to finish. Sorry. 
I think you'll all have more fun if us older folks stay out of it. 
Don't say that! You're still way too young to be one of the 'older folks', Ayame. 
Haha… well thank you, Ogami. You're quite talented at flattery. 
Setting that aside for the moment, is there anything you'd like to discuss with me as the leader of the Flower Division? 
Situation Report <br> Member Report <br> It's nothing 
I'd like to hear about how our last battle impacted the area, please. 
You did a splendid job of wrapping this last battle up quickly. You have a good grasp of the strengths of your division. 
We will continue to expect great things of you as a leader. 
Thankfully there were no civilian homes nearby during this last battle, but… 
You must remember that the longer a battle drags on, the more damage is done to the surrounding area. 
Please try to keep that in mind, and plan a strategy that will eliminate all threats as quickly as possible. 
I'd like to hear about the casualties from the last battle. 
Ogami… 
In a seven-person Flower Troupe, even lacking one member is an extraordinarily large loss, don't you agree? 
Though we should be grateful their life was spared. 
Sakura's capabilities are by no means lacking, but neither are they particularly excellent. She should not be sent out without proper support. 
Sumire has excellent combat capabilities, but you mustn't overestimate her. She needs proper support. 
Maria's defenses are weak, so you should avoid placing her in close-quarters combat situations. 
Kanna has the strength to fight one or two of even our Flower Troupe members in close-quarters combat. She's cut out to be an advance guard. 
Iris was angry. She still can't fight by herself, so we have to protect her… 
Kohran's attack skills are weak, but she can do range attacks. Make sure you understand that, Ogami. 
As the commanding officer, you must provide sufficient support. Your aid is what will strengthen the bonds of the unit. 
We took a lot of damage… You need to take better care of your subordinates or you'll lose their trust. 
We took far too much damage in that last battle. You need to make better use of everyone's talents. 
If you keep handling battles this way… well, let's set that aside. 
There were no casualties to the Flower Division. Well done, Ogami. 
I think you made excellent use of the Flower Division during the Fukagawa battle. 
Your evaluation of the battle and tactical decisions were spot on. 
That doesn't mean the war is over, though. 
Ah, we should discuss which member defeated the most enemies. 
The one with the most enemies shot down during the last battle was Sakura. 
If there are several enemies lined up in single file, Sakura's special attack can shine. 
Just give her the right orders. It's important to base your movement on enemy positions. 
The one with the most enemies shot down during the last battle was Sumire. 
Sumire's special attack is useful when you're surrounded by enemies. 
However, that doesn't mean you should send her off alone. 
The one with the most enemies shot down during the last battle was Maria. 
Maria should take up the rear. She's the most suited for firing from behind. 
There certainly won't be any friendly fire from her, right? 
The one with the most enemies shot down during the last battle was Kanna. 
Kanna has great attacking skills so she can battle at the front line. However, this means she is not fit as a back-line fighter. 
The one with the most enemies shot down during the last battle was Iris. 
She can move around fast, so it's a good strategy to have her support all the others. 
The one with the most enemies shot down during the last battle was Kohran. 
Her bombs have a wide area of effect. Let her aim at clusters of enemies. 
She was absolutely wonderful! 
That means she trusts you as a commander, Ogami. 
You think so? …Well, thank you, ma'am. 
I think that's all there is to report about that. Did you need anything else? 
No, thank you, ma'am. 
It seems Kanna and Sumire have changed somewhat since they returned. 
You think so? I haven't really noticed anything. 
Oh, they've definitely changed. I suppose they aren't showing on the surface, though. 
Somewhere in their hearts they came to recognize their own maturity… I think they became a little more headstrong. 
And you're the one who brought about this change, Ogami. 
Me? But I didn't do anything. 
I wonder about that… hehehe. 
Keep up the good work, Ensign. 
…doesn't look like Yuri's here. I think maybe she was helping a lost kid or something. 
I should try another room. 
Hey there, Ogami. We're finally done with the summer performance. 
I'm on duty today. 
Kasumi and Tsubaki are out getting a bite at the Renga. I wish I was with them. 
Aw man, that's too bad. Well, see you around. 
Do you need me for anything? 
(She's got her scarf pinned with a brooch.) 
(I wonder what it's made of… Couldn't be a real jewel, right?) 
…are you interested in this brooch? Oh, hey, listen to this, I actually got it super cheap at a bargain sale. 
…… 
(The way Yuri's hair curls away from her face is one of her most charming points…) 
(That bouncy look is pretty trendy.) 
Is something odd about my hair? Oh no…! I've got some split ends! 
(She's got a nice, small face. I think even a model would be jealous…) 
(It doesn't seem like she uses a lot of make-up. Well, she's got such a nice foundation, I don't think she really needs it…) 
What's the matter, Ogami? You're staring at my face… Oh, I see. You've fallen for me, right? 
Hey, you shouldn't tease your elders! 
Hehehe… sorry, Ogami. 
(Her eyes are shining with curiosity.) 
(Yumi's got a reputation for loving juicy gossip…) 
Hey, Ogami. Have you heard any good rumors lately? 
(Her clothes are pretty colorful.) 
Do you like this outfit? It's called the 'bus guide' look. It's really popular right now. 
(Goodness… that's certainly an aggressive neckline…) 
(But… isn't this supposed to be a uniform?) 
Ahaha. I see you've been stricken by my allure, Ogami~! 
Hey, hey! 
Recently, there have been a lot more reports of monster attacks. 
Really? 
Just a while ago there was a report of a cat-sized monster around the Suehirocho depot. 
I just hope this doesn't turn into something really bad… 
After we finish our summer performances, the theater is opened up for public use. 
There are early movie screenings and things like that. It's used for all sorts of entertainment purposes! 
They're actually doing an advance screening of 'The Three Musketeers' this time. 
Directed by Fred Niblo and starring Douglas Fairbanks… you should definitely check it out! 
So Ogami, how are things going with Kanna? 
What do you mean? 
I mean something happened between you two at Fukagawa, right? 
No… not really. 
Oh come on, seriously? You guys are no fun! 
Hey now… 
Finally, we're done for the summer! I can't believe I missed the summer festival and the Sumida River fireworks. 
Yeah, summer's almost over… 
I need to get out and buy some new clothing for the fall. I wonder what will be popular this year? 
Sumire hasn't been near the prop room ever since you guys went to Fukagawa. 
Hmm? Why? 
Well think about it. There's all sorts of stuff piled here and there in that room. Seems like the kind of place you'd find… 
…find what? Oh… Oh I get it. 
Ogami, seems like you've been pretty friendly with Sakura lately. 
Sakura's popular with just about everyone. I think it's because she comes off as nice and approachable. 
Ogami, seems like you've been pretty friendly with Sumire lately. 
Most people see her as hard to approach, but they also feel that's what makes her attractive. 
She's always getting bouquets from young guys from the upper class. 
Ogami, seems like you've been pretty friendly with Maria lately. 
Maria's fans basically fall into two groups. Either they're young students or girls. 
Looks like you and Iris have been hitting it off lately, Ogami. 
It's pretty obvious what makes Iris popular. Most of her fans are older folks. 
Seems like you've gotten pretty close to Kohran lately, huh, Ogami? 
Honestly… I really don't get where Kohran's popularity comes from… 
Seems like you've gotten pretty close to Kanna lately, huh, Ogami? 
Kanna's really popular with children. 
I expect that you will not fail me, Miroku? 
Indeed not… leave everything to me. Their headquarters are within my sights… 
Only one ley line remains! Our Hexagram of Infernal Calling nears its completion! 
The imperial capital shall be destroyed by the fires of judgment unlike anything the world has ever seen. 
We'll burn the corruption the west has brought to Japan! 
And from the ashes, the Tokugawa shogunate shall rise reborn! 
Go now! Strike down all that is westernized! 
At your bidding, Master. 
Your word is my command… 
Yes…
