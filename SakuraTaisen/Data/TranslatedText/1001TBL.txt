It's a photo of Sakura. She's looking right at me. I wonder what she's thinking...
It's a photo of Sumire. This is a side of her you don't see too often.
It's a photo of Maria. ...She's lost in thought and looks kind of sad...
A photo of Kanna. Kanna's signature strength comes through clearly.
A photo of Iris. She's surrounded by flowers and flashing a radiant smile.
A photo of Kohran. She's looking pretty in profile with her face dyed red by the evening sun.
A letter given to me by a patron. I was asked to give it to Sumire. I have a bad feeling about this...
Maria's pistol. This may help me escape from here...
A hair ornament. It's decorated with flowers and looks very elegant.
A pretty pendant. The delicate workmanship is gorgeous.
A hairpin for use in a traditional bun hairstyle. It would complement a formal outfit well.
This key will let me enter rooms I couldn't before.
I found this in a bedroom on the second floor. I can use it to access the back room.
A teacup Iris asked me to get for her. It has a very stylish design.
This is the matchbox Iris asked for. Its logo is quite colorful.
A knife Iris asked me to get for her. Just a normal utensil you'd use during a meal.
A prop sword and shield used onstage. They're well-made and look just like the real thing.
A prop crown used onstage. It's well-constructed and incredibly detailed.
A wig and costume used onstage. I wonder what kind of act could use a flashy outfit like this?
A photo of Sakura in her swimsuit. Wow, this is really something. I'm gonna treasure this.
A photo of Sumire in her stage costume. Her distinctive makeup really makes an impact.
It's a photo of Maria on stage in the military uniform from "For Love"... She's a beautiful woman disguised as a man.
A photo of Kanna in her training gear. Catching her in a private moment like this feels surprisingly intimate.
A photo of Iris in her swimsuit. She's holding a rubber ring and looks ready to have some fun. How cute.
A photo of Kohran. I don't get to see her with her braids undone very often. It's a nice look.
A photo of Ayame in a traditional outfit. I hope she'll always be as happy and content as she is here.
Ayame's gun. Why...? Why did it have to turn out like this...?

Something's wrong with the main engine. Our power output is going down fast!
The auxiliary engines are all out of action! There's no way we can fix them on the fly!
Port-side cannons, out of action!
Yaaaaaargh!
Untranslated
What?! Even the Mikasa is no match for them...?
This doesn't change our objective! We must protect the capital at all costs!
Oh, Lord... Even if it costs me my life, please, let justice be done...!
Our main cannon's been completely destroyed!
What?!
The port-side anti-aircraft cannons have caught fire!
Nraaargh!
We've lost our auto-flight regulators! We won't be able to stay in the air much longer!
Switch to manual controls! I'll take the helm. We're not done yet!
Minister! <br> The spirit gun energy <br> It's getting tall quickly!
What?!
The third main gun is wrecked! The main gun is annihilated!
The main engine is overheating!
We cannot stop the war!! So if we use the little spirit cannon...!
OK! You all escape!
Minister!!
Minister?....How are you doing?
You guys? Heh heh heh...You guys...still have weapons. It's the last trumpet... isn't it....
Ah!....Oh no!
Escape!
Minister!
Escape!!
y....yes!
Ayame! heh heh...As a soldier this is a good place to be given to die.
I appreciate it!
Everyone, give it your all!! The goal is...Satan!!
People lick it of course!
Great attack!!
Lucifer was once worshiped as a leader of the angels and the archangel closest to God...
In order to be the most powerful he went against his father and is undefeated.
God the father expels Lucifer from the heavenly world. He dropped him to the bottom of an endless land.
This is the beginning of hell.
So Lucifer became the eternal enemy of God. This is the Devil king's testimony.
Come....
The time of judgement has come.....this world will return to the darkness of the beginning.
Heaven is crying....a big earthquake comes.....it will become very big today. Today begins the black sound!!!
It is the day the court fullfills it's hope!
Come!!

Light.....huh?
Please stand up....
I am the archangel Michael...
The fallen Satan on the endless road of penitence walks to the well and guides
At the time of Satan's resurrection.... I am still resurrected....
I was sealed in this body of flesh.
Well stand up then. The world is hurting... Stand on your own two feet!
Sometimes I have to keep going even when there are a lot of dead bodies.
But! Nothing can beat great courage...
The connection of love that binds people together... will be the final winner!
Whatever problem there may be...The light of hope is in the heart of man...
Please go....Then it will show justice!
You all are a big blessing to your father.
