A photo of Sakura. She's looking right at me. I wonder what she's thinking… 
A photo of Sumire. This is a side of her you don't see too often. 
A photo of Maria. …She's lost in thought and looks kind of sad… 
A photo of Kanna. She's looking strong and sturdy. I hope I get to meet her soon. 
A photo of Iris. Surrounded by flowers, she looks like a cute little flower herself. 
A photo of Kohran. Chinese clothes look good on her. I wonder what kind of girl she is. 
It's the letter the guest left with me. I was told to give it to Sumire, but…Hmmm. 
It's Maria's gun. …Is there a way to use this to escape? 
It's a hair ornament. It's shaped like a flower and really cute. 
It's a pretty brooch. The fine craftsmanship is gorgeous. 
It's a hairpin. This would look best with Japanese clothes and a married woman's hairstyle. 
It's Iris's dear friend, Jean-Paul the teddy bear. She loves this stuffed animal. 
With this key, I should be able to get into rooms I couldn't enter before. 
I found this in the second-floor bedroom. With it, I should be able to get into the inner rooms. 
This is the cup Iris asked me to bring. It's a little bit fancy. 
This is the matchbox Iris asked me to bring. As matchboxes go, the cover is pretty colorful. 
This is the knife Iris asked me to bring. It's a perfectly normal table knife. 
This fake sword and shield were used in plays. The props have been made with care down to the last detail. 
This fake crown was used in plays. The intricate details have been rendered with great skill. 
This wig is used on stage. What kind of play would have such a flashy costume? 
Is that Sakura in a swimsuit? What a photo… I'll never let anyone else have this. 
It's Sumire in her stage costume. Her powerful makeup is really impressive. 
It's Maria on stage. Is that the military uniform from "For Love"…? She looks great in men's clothes. 
It's rare to see one of her training. This photo has a kind of private feel to it. 
Iris in a swimsuit? It's so cute that she has a pool tube. 
A photo of Kohran. I don't get to see her with her braids undone very often. It's a nice look. 
A photo of Ayame in a traditional outfit. I hope she'll always be as happy and content as she is here. 
Ayame's gun. Why…? Why did it have to turn out like this…? 
Nothing I can do here. I'd better check somewhere else… 
There's no one here. I'd better check somewhere else… 
I'd better check somewhere else… 
I'm not making any progress here. Maybe I should go to the manager's office and talk to Lt Gen Yoneda. 
But… the more I wander around this place, the more it seems like a normal theater… 
…So, a flower-viewing party in Ueno Park after battle? The cherry blossoms at night aren't too shabby. 
…But, sir, why do you keep everything about the Hive of Darkness top secret? 
I see. So that's what makes it a secret squadron. 
No problem. Thank you too, Sakura. 
I said, let me handle it! 
G-got it. 
Hahaha, thanks. 
(How can you get drunk on amazake?) 
Eee?!
