It's a photo of Sakura. She's looking right at me. I wonder what she's thinking…
It's a photo of Sumire. This is a side of her you don't see too often.
It's a photo of Maria. …She's lost in thought and looks kind of sad…
A photo of Kanna. Kanna's signature strength comes through clearly.
A photo of Iris. She's surrounded by flowers and flashing a radiant smile.
A photo of Kohran. She's looking pretty in profile with her face dyed red by the evening sun.
A letter given to me by a patron. I was asked to give it to Sumire. I have a bad feeling about this…
Maria's pistol. This may help me escape from here…
A hair ornament. It's decorated with flowers and looks very elegant.
A brooch. It's a beautiful piece of delicate craftsmanship.
A hairpin for use in a traditional bun hairstyle. It would complement a formal outfit well.
Jean-Paul the teddy bear. Iris's best friend. She always carries him with her and takes good care of him.
This key will let me enter rooms I couldn't before.
I found this in a bedroom on the second floor. I can use it to access the back room.
A teacup Iris asked me to get for her. It has a very stylish design.
This is the matchbox Iris asked for. Its logo is quite colorful.
A knife Iris asked me to get for her. Just a normal utensil you'd use during a meal.
A prop sword and shield used onstage. They're well-made and look just like the real thing.
A prop crown used onstage. It's well-constructed and incredibly detailed.
A wig and costume used onstage. I wonder what kind of act could use a flashy outfit like this?
A photo of Sakura in her swimsuit. Wow, this is really something. I'm gonna treasure this.
A photo of Sumire in her stage costume. Her distinctive makeup really makes an impact.
It's a photo of Maria on stage in the military uniform from "For Love"… She's a beautiful woman disguised as a man.
A photo of Kanna in her training gear. Catching her in a private moment like this feels surprisingly intimate.
A photo of Iris in her swimsuit. She's holding a rubber ring and looks ready to have some fun. How cute.
A photo of Kohran. I don't get to see her with her braids undone very often. It's a nice look.
A photo of Ayame in a traditional outfit. I hope she'll always be as happy and content as she is here.
Ayame's gun. Why…? Why did it have to turn out like this…?

That man… Aoi Satan… Maybe his true goal is the Pandemonium Insignia.
The Pandemonium Insignia are the key to the gates of the Sacred Demon Castle.
They're in our possession right now.
No one except me and Ayame can open this vault.
That's why we can expect him to attack us! So be ready!
It's a castle that was built hundreds of years ago to bring death and destruction to the world.
We can't allow it to appear on the face of the earth!
Even among the military, this is highly classified information. Don't talk to anyone about it.
The treasure is almost in our grasp!
Be careful, this place is riddled with traps! Take each step exactly like I'll show you!
Yes, OK.
First three steps to the left, then four to the right and seven straight ahead…
…Is a path you absolutely shouldn't take.

Captain! We have no time to lose! Let's dispatch to Tokyo Bay immediately!
Check it out, the fog has cleared up. It'll be morning soon…There's no such thing as a night that lasts forever!
Yeah! Just look at that!!
W-what the heck?!
Aah…aaah!!
Guaaah! T-that's…
Seima Castle…
Behold! Here lies Yamato, the phantom realm that was erased from history!
You are too late to thwart my ambitions. I am the true ruler! Satan, Lord of Heaven!
Degeneration, anger, despair! Come to me now…
The new capital shall be here in Yamato!
Huhuhuhu…Hu…Hahaha…Aaaahahahahahaha…
