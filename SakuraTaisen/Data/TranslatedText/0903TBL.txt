﻿﻿﻿﻿It's a photo of Sakura. She's looking right at me. I wonder what she's thinking… 
It's a photo of Sumire. This is a side of her you don't see too often. 
It's a photo of Maria. …She's lost in thought and looks kind of sad… 
It's a photo of Kanna. Her signature strength comes through clearly. 
It's a photo of Iris. She's surrounded by flowers and flashing a radiant smile. 
It's a photo of Kohran. She's looking pretty in profile with her face dyed red by the evening sun. 
A letter given to me by a patron. I was asked to give it to Sumire. I have a bad feeling about this… 
Maria's pistol. This may help me escape from here… 
A hair ornament. It's decorated with flowers and looks very elegant. 
A brooch. It's a beautiful piece of delicate craftsmanship. 
A hairpin for use in a traditional bun hairstyle. It would complement a formal outfit well. 
Jean-Paul the teddy bear. Iris's best friend. She always carries him with her and takes good care of him. 
This key will let me enter rooms I couldn't before. 
I found this in a bedroom on the second floor. I can use it to access the back room. 
A set of cups Iris asked me to get for her. They have a very stylish design. 
This is the matchbox Iris asked for. Its logo is quite colorful. 
Some knives Iris asked me to get for her. Just a normal utensil you'd use during a meal.
A prop sword and shield used onstage. They're well-made and look just like the real thing. 
A prop crown used onstage. It's well-constructed and incredibly detailed. 
A wig and costume used onstage. I wonder what kind of act could use a flashy outfit like this? 
It's a photo of Sakura in her swimsuit. Wow, this is really something. I'm gonna treasure this. 
It's a photo of Sumire in her stage costume. Her distinctive makeup really makes an impact. 
It's a photo of Maria on stage in the military uniform from "For Love"… She's a beautiful woman disguised as a man. 
It's a photo of Kanna in her training gear. Catching her in a private moment like this feels surprisingly intimate. 
It's a photo of Iris in her swimsuit. She's holding a rubber ring and looks ready to have some fun. How cute. 
It's a photo of Kohran. I don't get to see her with her braids undone very often. It's a nice look. 
It's a photo of Ayame in a traditional outfit. I hope she'll always be as happy and content as she is here. 
Ayame's gun. Why…? Why did it have to turn out like this…? 
I've got a bad feeling in my gut… This night is giving me the creeps. 
…… 
Uh, gah… Lord… Satan… 
…? 
What are you doing here, Ayame? 
!! 
Ayame! 
What's the matter with you!? 
…… 
Gah… Lo… Lord Satan… 
!! 
A-Ayame! Damn it, the Pandemonium Regalia…! 
Yell. <br> Shoot her. 
Shoot her. 
N-no! 
! 
… 
Gah! 
Gah! Damn it… 
I can't do it… 
… 
What!? 
Ayame! You mustn't hand that over! 
B-but… Wait! Ayame! 
A-Ayame… 
…… 
A-Ayame… 
… 
A-Ayame… 
…… 
A-Ayame… 
…… 
Auntie Ayame… 
…… 
A-Ayame… 
……

Hehehe… 
That's… 
Waah! 
A-Ayame… 
Hehe… Muahaha… Time to hand over the Pandemonium Regalia… 
The Pandemonium Regalia! 
Come, Ayame… Come to me! 
Y-yes… 
Ogami! Please… You have to shoot me! 
Please, shoot me now! This is an order, Ogami! 
Ogami… Don't shoot! 
Please be yourself… The real Ogami. 
Ogami… 
Ogami… 
Heheheh… How ironic that the seal cast upon me would also be the strongest of all… 
Remember, Ayame… Remember the lost paradise… 
Ogami! 
Ayame! 
Whatcha doing?! 
It's… all… right… Ogami. 
Hehehehe… Ichiro Ogami. Your calm judgment, your quick actions, your courage… All worthy of praise. 
But all that will be in vain… It will be my greatest pleasure to pluck the seed of hope from your dirt… 
Foolish humans! I hope you enjoy the bitter taste of despair! 
Behold… this! 
Hehehe… This is the strongest of all Kouma, the one closest to me… My faithful servant… 
Aya-me… the “murderess” has awakened! 
Yes… the two of us are one. Our vow from the last life will finally be fulfilled… 
Hee… 
Tonight's fated meeting… We will conquer everything and create a demonic paradise… 
Heeheehee… 
And this is the key we sought. Please accept the Pandemonium Regalia. 
Aaaah!! 
Muahaha… Only pain and desperation await you… 
Come… sweet ruin… 
The Ayame you knew is already dead. 
She died by that gun you're holding right now. Aaaahahahaha! 
Your precious Ayame is gone… Along with the crimson moon!
