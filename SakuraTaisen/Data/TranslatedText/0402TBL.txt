﻿﻿﻿﻿It's a photo of Sakura. She's looking right at me. I wonder what she's thinking… 
It's a photo of Sumire. This is a side of her you don't see too often. 
It's a photo of Maria. She's lost in thought and looks kind of sad… 
It's a photo of Kanna. Her signature strength comes through clearly.
It's a photo of Iris. She's surrounded by flowers and flashing a radiant smile. 
It's a photo of Kohran. She's looking pretty in profile with her face dyed red by the evening sun. 
A letter given to me by a customer. I was asked to give it to Sumire. I have a bad feeling about this… 
Maria's pistol. This may help me escape from here… 
A hair ornament. It's decorated with flowers and looks very elegant. 
A pretty pendant. The delicate workmanship is gorgeous. 
A hairpin for use in a traditional bun hairstyle. It would complement a formal outfit well. 
Jean-Paul the teddy bear. Iris's best friend. She always carries him with her and takes good care of him. 
This key will let me enter rooms I couldn't before. 
I found this in a bedroom on the second floor. I can use it to access the back room. 
A set of cups Iris asked me to get for her. They have a very stylish design. 
This is the matchbox Iris asked for. Its logo is quite colorful. 
Some knives Iris asked me to get for her. Just a normal utensil you'd use during a meal. 
A prop sword and shield used onstage. They're well-made and look just like the real thing. 
A prop crown used onstage. It's well constructed and incredibly detailed. 
A wig and costume used onstage. I wonder what kind of act could use a flashy outfit like this? 
It's a photo of Sakura in her swimsuit. Wow, this is really something. I'm gonna treasure this. 
It's a photo of Sumire in her stage costume. Her distinctive makeup really makes an impact. 
It's a photo of Maria on stage in the uniform from "For Love"… a beautiful woman disguised as a man. 
It's a photo of Kanna in her training gear. Catching her in a private moment like this feels surprisingly intimate. 
It's a photo of Iris in her swimsuit. She's holding a rubber ring and looks ready to have some fun. How cute. 
It's a photo of Kohran. I don't get to see her with her braids undone very often. It's a nice look. 
It's a photo of Ayame in a traditional outfit. I hope she'll always be as happy and content as she is here. 
Ayame's gun. Why…? Why did it have to turn out like this…? 
…! 
It… was just a dream. 
…Mon Frère. I want… 
I want…to become a grown-up as soon as possible… 
…Morning already? I wonder if Iris has calmed down… 
Iris… 
No. I need to go see Iris and talk to her. 
…Iris. It's me. 
…! 
Would you listen to what I have to say, please? 
… 
Let's try the date again. <br> Cut this out! 
Iris… next Sunday, are you free? Let's try the date again. 
…What's wrong? 
It's not like that, Iris. 
I'm not lying, Iris! 
Iris, cut this out! When will you be satisfied with the trouble you're causing everyone!? 
What!? 
That's not true! Everyone's really worried about you! 
It's nothing like that! Everybody likes you, Iris! 
Of course! 
What!? 
That's not true! Everyone's really worried about you! 
It's nothing like that! Everybody likes you, Iris! 
Of course! 
K-Kiss?! 
(…What should I do…) 
Kiss her. 
… 
W-What's wrong, Iris!? 
I-Iris… 
Iris! 
… 
…She's gone. 
…! W-What!? 
Ogami!! 
Sakura! What on earth is…!? 
This is really bad! Iris boarded a Koubu and headed outside!! 
W-What!? 
If Iris goes running around town the way she is now, there's going to be all sorts of trouble! 
Come on, let's get to the Command Room. 
This is quite the pickle… Who'd have thought little Iris would go running around town in a Koubu. 
Not to mention the Koubu she took was our very latest model, fresh from the Hanayashiki Branch. 
Sir… Do we know where Iris is headed? 
It appears she's heading toward Asakusa. 
Sh… She is!? 
She's managed to get that far? But it's her first time even piloting a Koubu! 
Get to Asakusa and bring Iris back to us. I'm counting on you, everyone! 
What…? 
Sir! 
What, Ayame? What's gotten you all riled up? 
It's the Hive of Darkness! 
I've got a confirmed report of the Hive’s Hex Mechs in Asakusa! 
Are you serious!? 
Dammit! They would have to show up right now, wouldn't they! 
Well, I suppose we should count it a blessing that Iris is heading for Asakusa, then. 
This way, we can secure Iris and take down the Hive of Darkness simultaneously. 
All right. Head for Asakusa immediately! I'm counting on you, Ogami! 
Yes, sir! 
(OK… let's move…) 
…Wait a moment, Ogami. 
Ma'am…? 
Ogami… I trust you understand why Iris ran away. 
… 
What would you say are Iris's good points, Ogami? 
Wha…? 
For example, she's cheerful, innocent and is honest with herself and others about her feelings… 
The very things that make her “childish” are also the things we like the most about her, wouldn't you agree? 
So, she shouldn't force herself to grow up too fast… 
Please tell her that, Ogami. 
I think perhaps… you are the only one who can. 
Well then, Ogami. Everyone's waiting for you! Sortie at once! 
Assault Troupe, launch! <br> We'll bring Iris back! 
Imperial Assault Troupe, launch! 
Yes, sir! Our destination is the Kaminarimon in Asakusa! 
We're coming for you, Iris! 
You can put your faith in us… 
We've got your back, kiddo! 
Imperial Assault Troupe, launching! 
All right everyone! We're bringing Iris back, got it? 
You got it, Boss! 
This time we'll brook no failures. 
Iris, we're coming… 
So don't go doing anything crazy! 
Let's go, Ogami! Let's save Iris!! 
Your response, Ogami! Pull yourself together. 
Oh, yeah… 
All right. Imperial Assault Troupe, launch!!

No! 
Even… Even when we went out, you wouldn’t walk arm-in-arm with me… 
I know you get bored spending time with a kid like me. 
You're lying! 
I knew it. 
You think I'm a bother. Everyone does. 
You're lying! You all think I'm a bother because I'm a kid. You all hate me! 
…Even you, Mon Frère? 
Unused
Then… kiss me! 
Right now! 
Ahhh…!? 
…Mon Frère, you're lying… 
You don't love me at all! You don't want to kiss me… 
I can read your thoughts. 
You… You think I'm just a little kid after all! 
Liar!
