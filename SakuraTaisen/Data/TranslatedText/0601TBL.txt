It's a photo of Sakura. She's looking right at me. I wonder what she's thinking…
It's a photo of Sumire. This is a side of her you don't see too often.
It's a photo of Maria. She's lost in thought and looks kind of sad…
A photo of Kanna. Her signature strength comes through clearly.
A photo of Iris. She's surrounded by flowers and flashing a radiant smile.
A photo of Kohran. She's looking pretty in profile with her face dyed red by the evening sun.
A letter given to me by a customer. I was asked to give it to Sumire. I have a bad feeling about this…
Maria's pistol. This may help me escape from here…
A hair ornament. It's decorated with flowers and looks very elegant.
A pretty pendant. The delicate workmanship is gorgeous.
A hairpin for use in a traditional bun hairstyle. It would complement a formal outfit well.
This key will let me enter rooms I couldn't before.
I found this in a bedroom on the second floor. I can use it to access the back room.
A set of cups Iris asked me to get for her. They have a very stylish design.
This is the matchbox Iris asked for. Its logo is quite colorful.
Some knives Iris asked me to get for her. Just a normal utensil you'd use during a meal.
A prop sword and shield used onstage. They're well-made and look just like the real thing.
A prop crown used onstage. It's well constructed and incredibly detailed.
A wig and costume used onstage. I wonder what kind of act could use a flashy outfit like this?
A photo of Sakura in her swimsuit. Wow, this is really something. I'm gonna treasure this.
A photo of Sumire in her stage costume. Her distinctive makeup really makes an impact.
It's a photo of Maria on stage in the military uniform from "For Love"… She's a beautiful woman disguised as a man.
A photo of Kanna in her training gear. Catching her in a private moment like this feels surprisingly intimate.
A photo of Iris in her swimsuit. She's holding a rubber ring and looks ready to have some fun. How cute.
A photo of Kohran. I don't get to see her with her braids undone very often. It's a nice look.
A photo of Ayame in a traditional outfit. I hope she'll always be as happy and content as she is here.
Ayame's gun. Why…? Why did it have to turn out like this…?
Jean-Paul the teddy bear. Iris's best friend. She always carries him with her and takes good care of him.
(…If you look closely, she's still wearing her stage hairdo.) 
(…She must have come here in a big hurry after the play ended.) 
(As always, that's some wild hair.) 
(It's Kanna's trademark headband. It always looks so good on her.) 
(I've heard that the store even sells "Kanna Headbands" marketed to children.) 
(Wow… You don't usually see Kanna looking like this.) 
(I wonder what happened here…? Kanna's got a troubled look in her eyes.) 
(I wonder if she ran out of time… Her clothes are all over the place.) 
(Why was Kanna in such a rush?) 
(Oho?! Maybe it's my imagination, but it seems like I can see more than usual…) 
(No! I can't believe I'm staring at Kanna's chest when she's in trouble… What am I doing?!) 
(O-Oh nooo! My eyes are drawn like a magnet to her breasts!) 
Boss… what exactly are you lookin' at?! 
That window goes out to the back of the theater. You can see Yaesu and Nihonbashi in the distance. 
There are a lot of books here. From economy to military tactics, recipes, novels and children's books. 
Ahh, it's nice and sunny today, but it'd be nice to relax here even on a rainy day. 
Phew… Coming back to your room after a job well done feels good. 
…Nothing going on here either. I should try and meet up with everyone else. 
Huh… I wonder if Sakura is in her room. 
How about I go check elsewhere.
…It seems she isn't here. Didn't everyone say they were getting together today? 
Hmm… I wonder if Kanna is in her room? 
How about I go check elsewhere.
…Seems like she's not here. I guess she hasn't returned to her room yet. 
Hmm… I wonder if Maria is in her room? 
How about I go check elsewhere. 
…Seems like she's not here. I guess she hasn't returned to her room yet. 
I wonder if Iris is on her way back… 
OK, guess I'll head somewhere else. 
Damn. Seems there's no one here. 
I wonder if Sumire is inside. 
No sense standing around here. I should get going. 
…Seems there's no one here. 
This room is kind of useless now, isn't it? 
Nobody here either. Off to somewhere else. 
The room is full of costumes. 
But… there's no one here. I'll go check somewhere else. 
Sumire still isn't here. Everyone said they would gather in the salon but… 
Not much I can do about it. I'll be leaving. 
No matter when I come here it's always a mess. 
There was no reason to come here. I'll go elsewhere. 
All the sets from the performance are stored away here… 
Nobody here. I'll be going then. 
In summertime, we have to be extra careful about keeping the kitchen clean and sanitary. 
…Or at least, I can't help but feel that way. I'll head somewhere else. 
It's always lively when a performance is going, but it's quiet now that we're closed. 
There was no reason to come here. I better go elsewhere. 
I'm finally free from my ticket collecting duties now that the show is over. 
I guess I'll rest my weary bones today. 
Even the regular customers came and greeted me. 
I wonder if that means I've finally become accustomed to this place… 
Even after the curtain falls and the last of the audience has left, I can still feel the enthusiasm of the stage… 
What is everyone doing, I wonder. They must have gathered in the salon by now. 
There's nobody here. The performance has already ended but no one's come yet. 
Nothing to do here. I'll check somewhere else. 
I can still feel the energy from the performance in the air. 
I guess it's about time to go. 
Even in the afternoon this storage room is pretty dark… 
Nothing to do here either. I suppose I'll check elsewhere. 
The show just finished so it makes sense that no one's practicing here. 
…I guess I'll go somewhere else. 
Nothing beats a good swim in the summer. I figured someone might be swimming here… 
Nothing going on here. I'll go check another room. 
The Koubu are in excellent condition, all thanks to Kohran. 
Kohran is usually here… Oh well, I'll check somewhere else. 
There's no one here… 
Should I check another room? I came here kind of absentmindedly. 
It seems like Iris was taking a shower until just a moment ago. 
There was no reason to come here. I'll go elsewhere. 
I've heard these medical pods can be moved using the underground railway system if the situation calls for it… 
…I just pray we won't ever need to use them… 
The backbone of the Assault Troupe: the Command Room. When the alarm sounds, we all gather here. 
But… there's no one here. I'll check another room. 
I guess there's only a few of these steam processors in Japan. It's an amazing machine. 
My body feels tense just from coming here. And I'm supposed to be a soldier…? 
Nobody here. Off to somewhere else. 
Oh, are you done? 
Oh, are you done? 
Ogami, I appreciate your interest, but…

Oh, I guess that's true. I'll come again some other time.

Hmm… Kohran's fanbase is a bit of a mystery. 
Phew… The Flower Division's summer performance of "Journey to the West" is finally over. 
Since the incident at Fukagawa, Sumire and Kanna's performances have really been in tune with each other. 
There were a ton of patrons today because the play's run is ending, so clipping tickets was especially taxing. 
Ahhhhh, I'm beat. Anyway, what should I do now? 
Speak with Tsubaki. <br> Go back to my room. <br> Go meet up with everyone. 
I'll chat with Tsubaki, since I'm done with work for today. 
Ah, Ogami! Great work today. Will you be finishing soon? 
Yup, I'll be leaving soon. 
Thanks for your hard work today~! 
(No matter when I see her, Tsubaki is always so energetic.) 
What's wrong, Ogami? You were staring at me a little… 
(Tsubaki is always energetic, isn't she? She doesn't seem even a little tired.) 
Are you all right, Ogami? You look a little dazed. Aren't you tired? 
I'm done with work, but you're still here, eh, Tsubaki? 
Yep. We have to see the customers out. This is the busiest time of the night! 
That's true… Well then, I'll get out of your hair. 
Go back to your room. <br> Invite Tsubaki out. <br> Meet up with everyone. 
Well then, I'll be heading out. 
Thanks for all your hard work! Oh, and everyone from the Flower Division should be in the salon! 
Everyone gave their all in today's performance, so please give them some kind words, OK? 
I'll do that. Anyway, keep up the good work. 
Eh?! Really?! Ah, well… What should I do…? 
What's wrong? 
Actually… I had promised Kasumi that I would go eat with her at Renga. 
Oh, really… Well, if you've got a prior engagement, then there's nothing we can do about it. 
I'm very sorry! I've already made plans this time, but please invite me out again soon! 
All right… Next time it is! Well, I'll be going then. 
It's a promise, then! And again, thank you for your hard work today! 
If that's all, I'm heading home. 
Thanks for all your hard work! Oh, and everyone from the Flower Division should be in the salon! 
Everyone gave their all in today's performance, so please give them some kind words, OK? 
I'll do that. Anyway, keep up the good work. 
What's wrong Ogami? You look a little out of it. 
Hey, Miss! Give me that picture! 
Yes, welcome! Kanna Kirishima's picture, right? That'll be 50 zeni please! 
We'll be performing a new show in the fall, so please come see us again! 
You look busy… I'll head out now. Keep up the good work, OK? 
Of course. Thank you for working hard as well. 
Phew… I'm beat. I'll go back to my room and take a rest. 
All right, I guess I should meet up with everyone and at least show my face. 
Everyone should be relaxing near the salon after they finish changing. 
Ahh… No good… I'm really sleepy all of a sudden. 
I'm all done clipping tickets for now, so I'll head out. 
Well, you're surprisingly close to Tsubaki, aren't you Ogami?! 
Huh!? S-Sakura! W-When did you get here!? 
Hmph! I had just come here to look for you. 
Looking for m-me…? 
After the performance, we were planning to have an after party with everyone from the Flower Division, but… 
…I'll just have to tell everyone that you'll be absent due to your dinner with Tsubaki! 
Hey! W-Wait a minute! 
She didn't accept my invite! <br> That was just a joke! <br> Hey, listen for a second! 
She didn't accept my invitation. She had already made other plans… 
So if she hadn't made plans in advance, then you'd be going to eat with her? I can't believe it! 
You can't believe it? It's just going out for dinner… 
That doesn't matter! And to think I came here to invite you to the after party… I'll be taking my leave! 
Oh… She's gone. She came here just to ask me to join her, and now this… What a bummer. 
Oh, that was just a joke! I wasn't being serious. 
I didn't take you for the type to invite girls out as a joke! 
Well, I came here to invite you to the after party but… Just kidding! I'll be taking my leave. 
Oh… She's gone. She came here just to ask me to join her, and now this… What a bummer. 
Sakura! Please wait! Just listen to me for a minute. 
Yes, what is it?
Tsubaki was quite busy today, right? I just thought it would be nice to treat her to dinner. 
Then that's when you called me. This isn't a fib or a joke… I'm being serious. 
I understand. I can believe that. 
You're so kind, Ogami. But sometimes… that kindness… 
Hmm? What about my kindness…? 
No, no. It's nothing. Anyway… 
Since our summer performance is over, we're having a big after party with everyone! 
Please come and at least show your face. 
Thank you, of course I'll go. Where is everyone meeting? 
Everyone is resting in the salon now. Anyway, I'll be going. 
(Right, the after party… Regardless, I'm glad I was able to avoid a fight with Sakura.) 
… 
What is it? If you don't have anything to say to me, then please don't call after me! 
…I'll be taking my leave. 
Ah! She left. I guess I made her angry… What a bummer. 
I'll have to apologize later. 
Mon Frère!! You came to peep at me, didn't you!? 
There's no ulterior motives! <br> …I've been caught. <br> I came to check up on you! 
You're mistaken! I don't have any ulterior motives or anything like that! 
Liar! Mon Frère is dirty! 
D-Dirty? 
Pervert! 
Degenerate! 
What are you saying? And how do you know those words?! 
I-I dunno! 
Ah! Iris…! She left… Well, that's a shame. 
…I've been caught, have I? Oh well, what can you do, ahahaha… 
Grrrrrrr! Mon Frère is such an idiot! Pervert! Dirty old man! I can't believe this! 
Uggh! Get out of here! 
Are you kidding me? This is the second time this has happened! This is too much. 
Yikes! It looks like Iris teleported me here. 
I was worried about you, Iris. 
…!? 
I was passing by the dressing room and heard you screaming… 
I was worried that something had happened, so I ran here as quickly as I could. 
…Reeeeally? 
Really. 
REALLY, really? 
Really, really. 
Aww! I believe you! 
(Phew…) 
But… Mon Frère. You're lucky it was me… if it were someone else, then… 
They might've been super duper mad! Be careful, OK? 
Anyway, I'm gonna go meet up with everyone else! Bye-bye~! 
S-She's right… I'd better be careful. 
… 
Mon Frère… don't make that face! 
I'm not angry, OK? 
I'm sorry, Iris. It was a little careless of me to run in here like that. 
No, no, it's OK, Mon Frère. 
Anyway, I'm gonna go meet up with everyone else! Bye-bye~! 
I'm sorry I made you worry, Mon Frère. 
It's OK, really. I just heard your screams and thought something might've happened to you. 
Honestly, I'm just glad it wasn't anything serious. 
Actually, I was a little surprised when I heard your voice but… 
I'm so happy that you would worry about me like that! 
Hahaha. Next time make sure you don't mix up the hot and cold water, OK? 
OK~! Anyway, I'm gonna go meet up with everyone else! 
Oh man… she's really carefree.
Ahhh, that was refreshing! Huh? Mon Frère, what's wrong? 
I should be asking you that. I was walking through the corridor and heard quite the scream coming from here. 
…Huh? Ohhhh… 
I mixed up the hot and cold water, so I shouted… Maybe that's what you heard? 
Are you kidding me? I'm glad I didn't rush in here. 
I think you just wanted to come into my shower stall, isn't that right? 
That's not it at all. <br> …You're right. <br> Leave it to your imagination. 
That's not it at all. I wasn't trying to catch a peek or anything. 
Mon Frère… 
W-What?! Hold on a second… Why are you mad, Iris? 
Hmph! You don't want to see me naked! Isn't that right? 
Well… Uh… 
Hmph! Stupid Mon Frère! 
Phew. She left but…why was she mad at me?! 
Well if I'm being honest… I wanted to take a peek. 
Hehehe! I knew it! Mon Frère is a pervert! 
… 
Aww, Mon Frère's being shy! How cuuuute! 
Well… Uh… 
Next time… Let's get in together! OK, Mon Frère? 
…Hey now! 
Anyway, I'm gonna go meet up with everyone else! Bye-bye~! 
Ahh… This is no good. What am I saying?! 
…I'll leave that to your imagination. 
You were just itching to come to my shower stall, weren't you, Mon Frère? 
… 
See?! I knew it! 
I-Iris! Hold on a second! 
Don't be shy, don't be shy! 
Anyway, I'm gonna go meet up with everyone else! Bye-bye~! 
I… I can't deny it though… Maybe I did want to sneak in… I'm scaring myself. 
… 
See! You're thinking about it, aren't you? You wanted to sneak a peek! 
N-No, actually… 
It would've been fine if you came in, y'know? 
H-Hey! I-Iris! You shouldn't tease adults like that! 
Don't be shy! Don't be shy! 
Anyway, I'm gonna go meet up with everyone else! Bye-bye~! 
She's right though… I was thinking about it… I'm scaring myself. 
Kyaaaaah!! 
Huh!? That scream… That was Iris! It sounded like it was coming from the dressing room. 
Hurry to the dressing room. <br> Shout "What's wrong!?" 
Iris isn't here?! That must mean… the shower room?! 
Damnit… What should I do!? 
Hurry to the shower room. <br> Shout "What's wrong!?" 
If Iris isn't here… she must be in the shower room… This is bad… 
The hell with it! I can't just abandon Iris! I'm busting into the shower room! 
Iris! Are you all right?! 
Huh?! Oh! Mon Frère! Get out of here! 
Huh? What the!? Uwaaaaaah! 
Whoa… Apparently I've been teleported here by Iris… 
I wanted to go and help her but… I've been mistaken for a peeping tom… 
Iris! What's wrong!? Are you OK!? 
Huh!? That voice… Mon Frère?! Mon Frère, what's wrong? 
I heard someone screaming and thought something was wrong! 
Well… Uh… I… I thought I would take a shower but I accidentally mixed up the hot and cold water. 
I got super surprised and shouted real loud. 
Are you kidding? That's it…? I was more surprised than you were! 
I'm sorry, Mon Frère. Were you worried about me~? 
Of course I was! 
Reeeally…? Hehehe, I'm happy. 
Well, it was nothing after all. I'm glad it wasn’t anything serious. 
I’m worried about Iris but… I’m a little nervous to enter the dressing room. 
First things first, I need to figure out what's going on. 
Iris! What's wrong!? Are you OK!? 
Huh!? That voice… Mon Frère?! Mon Frère, what's wrong? 
I heard someone screaming and thought something was wrong! 
Well… Uh… I… I thought I would take a shower but I accidentally mixed up the hot and cold water. 
I got super surprised and shouted real loud. 
Are you kidding? That's it…? I was more surprised than you were! 
I'm sorry, Mon Frère. Were you worried about me~? 
Of course! 
Reeeally…? Hehehe, I'm happy. 
Well, it was nothing after all. I'm glad it was nothing big. 
I’m worried about Iris but… I’m a little nervous to enter the dressing room. 
First things first, I need to figure out what's going on. 
Hey, Boss… 
I feel bad about just leaving Kanna in the lurch, but… guess I'd better go elsewhere. 
What's wrong, Kanna? You have a worried look on your face. 
Well, I've heard that a bunch o' kids tend to get separated from their families whenever shows let out. 
So I started wondering if I could do anything to help, and I rushed over here once the play ended. 
All right! Let's do it. <br> Kanna… you're so kind. <br> I'm in a bit of a rush… 
All right! Let's help these lost kids find their parents! 
Boss! So you'll help me?! 
Well, we can't just leave the poor kids alone, right? 
All right! Having you around is as good as having a hundred average guys! Let's do it! 
…Kanna… You're so kind. 
Hmm? Me… kind? Boss… 
But… back when I was a kid, I once got lost in the forest, so… 
I understand how lonely those lost kids must be. 
…All right! Let's help these lost kids find their parents! 
Boss! So you'll help me?! 
Well, we can't just leave the poor kids alone, right? 
All right! Having you around is as good as having a hundred average guys! Let's do it! 
I know it's rude but… I'm in a bit of a hurry. 
…Well then. I guess I'll figure something out. 
See you later… 
Boss! You don't look like you're doing anything important. Can you give me a hand with a little something? 
Huh? H-Hey, I never said I had nothing to do! 
Aw, come on, don't make such a fuss! These kids are in a pinch, we should help 'em out! 
I'm no match for you, am I? Got it, I'll help too! 
We've got this! Having you around is as good as having a hundred average guys! Let's do it! 
The play's run is ending today, yeah? Kids keep getting separated from their parents in the crowd. 
All right! Let's help these lost kids find their parents. 
Yo, Boss! If you're here, that means you came to help me, right? 
I mean… it's not like that, but… 
Boss… You wouldn't leave these poor kids alone, would you? 
W-Well… 
I know you aren't that kind of guy, Boss. All right! Let's help these kids out. 
…Got it! Let's help them out! 
All right! Having you around is as good as having a hundred average men! Let's do it, Boss! 
Ogami, Kanna! Thank you so much for helping me today. 
It sure took a while, didn't it? 
Don't be so modest! Your help today really saved my bacon. 
Exactly, Kanna. Sure it took some time, but at least all the kids were able to find their parents. 
That's true. I'm really grateful for everyone's help. 
As expected from the Boss! Your judgment and memory were fantastic! 
It was nothing, really. I'm just relieved all the kids were able to find their parents. 
I know it well… what it feels like to lose sight of your parents… 
You just can’t stop thinking “did they leave without me?” and it makes you wanna start crying. 
I don't want kids to ever think about crying when they come here to see the Flower Division's performances. 
Creating a place where these kids can come to the theater and make good memories… that's my most important job. 
Memories are key, right? <br> Fighting is important too. <br> That's just like you, Kanna. 
Our memories are precious, aren't they? 
Exactly. We can give those kids a dream to work towards. 
Even if bad things happen, they can think back to our performances with a smile on their faces. 
Every time I'm on the stage, I tell myself that I want to create those kinds of memories with my performance. 
…Or something like that. Hope I'm not actin' like a show-off? 
No, not at all. That’s a wonderful mindset to have. 
Aw, c'mon. I appreciate it, but flattery will get you nowhere. 
Well, I'd better get going, then. Everyone should be in the salon by now. 
Boss… thank you for helping me. 
That's true. But fighting is still our most important job. 
Of course! Protecting everyone from evil is the Imperial Assault Troupe's most important job! 
Everything that's precious to these kids… their families, homes and even their dreams… I'll protect them all! 
…Or something like that. Hope I'm not actin' like a show-off? 
No, not at all. That’s a wonderful mindset to have. 
Aw, c'mon. I appreciate it, but flattery will get you nowhere. 
Well, I'd better get going, then. Everyone should be in the salon by now. 
Boss… thank you for helping me. 
That's just like you, Kanna. 
Really? I just figure, I hate feeling lonely… 
Life's a lot better with a smile on your face and a spring in your step! 
Yeah. And that's the kind of place this theater is. 
Yep. For my part, I wanna keep this theater overflowing with smiling faces. 
Well, I'd better get going, then. Everyone should be in the salon by now. 
Boss… thank you for helping me. 
…Or something like that. Hope I'm not actin' like a show-off? 
Well, I'd better get going, then. Everyone should be in the salon by now. 
Boss… thank you for helping me. 
Kanna is always a hit with the kids. No doubt it's because of the energy and brightness she brings to the stage…
…but I bet it's also just because of how much she loves children. 
Oh, Ogami! Kanna! Why don't you let me take care of the kids? 
Dammit! I couldn't get any of those kids back to their parents! 
I should've tried a little harder, myself… I'm sorry, Kanna. 
What're you sayin', Boss? You gave it your best shot, didn't you? 
Yuri'll take over finding their parents from here. She's good at this kind of thing. 
As for me, I'll be happy to just put smiles back on their faces. 
…Or something. Hahaha! A-Anyway, I'm gonna head to the salon. 
Thanks for the help, Boss. 
Kanna is always a hit with the kids. No doubt it's because of the energy and brightness she brings to the stage…
…but I bet it's also just because of how much she loves children.  
Yo, Boss! Looks like we made it through the performance unscathed. 
Nicely done. Playing the lead part couldn't have been easy, either. 
Heheh… Thanks. I'm just happy that the kids enjoyed this one. 
Oh! Speaking of kids, I gotta get moving! 
Later, Boss! 
What's the hurry? <br> …Your kids? <br> Well, I'll see you later. 
What's got you in such a hurry? 
Looks like there's some lost kids in the lobby and it's causin' problems for Yuri. I'm gonna go back her up. 
When you say kids… you don't mean… your kids, do you? 
Don't be an idiot! I don't have any kids! 
Looks like there's some lost kids in the lobby and it's causin' problems for Yuri. I'm gonna go back her up. 
Give it your all, OK? <br> Well, I'll see you later. <br> Mind if I give you a hand? 
Oh really? That seems tough… Well, be sure to give it your all! 
I will. Those kids came out here to see our performance, so I can't just abandon them. 
I'll see ya later, Boss! If you get a minute, I'd appreciate your help in the lobby! 
That's Kanna for you. Always ready to help. 
The fact that she's so kind and dependable must be why the kids love her. 
Hmm, really…? Well, I'll see you later. 
…Tch! That's cold, Boss. If you've really got nothing to do, can't you gimme a hand? 
Hmph!! Well then, Boss… 
(Maybe I was being a little too flippant.) 
Is it all right if I give you a hand, then? I'm not really doing anything right now… 
Really?! Thanks for helping me out, Boss. All right, let's head to the lobby! 
… 
Boss! You don't look like you're doing anything important. Can you give me a hand with a little something? 
Huh? H-Hey, I never said I had nothing to do! 
Aw, come on, don't make such a fuss! These kids are in a pinch, so we should help 'em out! 
I'm no match for you, am I? Got it, I'll help too! 
That's more like it! Right, let's get over to the lobby! 
Hmm… I'm not really sure but… I'll see you later. 
All right. Later then, Boss! 
I'm in a bit of a rush, so I'll catch you later! 
Hey, Kanna! …The play just ended, where's she going in such a hurry? 
Oh, Ogami! Nice work today. 
Hey, Sakura. Today was rough, what with so many customers! 
Well, today was the last run of our summer play. By the way, about that… 
Everyone should be gathering in the salon by now. 
If you don't mind, Ogami… would you please come with me? 
Sure, I'll come along. <br> I've got plans… Sorry. <br> I can go on my own. 
Sure, I'll come along. Let's go. 
OK! It looks like coming to get you was a good idea after all. 
Oh? Sakura… did you come here just to get me? 
Huh?! I just figured that you'd be tired from work is all… 
…Thank you, Sakura. 
I-It's nothing, really. S-Should we get going Ogami? 
Come on!! Don't be like this! Everyone's already waiting, so let's hurry up and go! 
Ah, Sakura! Could you stop pulling my hand?! 
Heheh, if you're not going, then I'll just have to pull you all the way to the salon! 
I appreciate it, but… I have something I really need to do… I'll definitely come by a little later. 
…Is that so? I understand. Well, everyone is already in the salon, so please stop by, OK? 
…I'm holding you to that, Ogami! 
Everyone's meeting in the salon, eh? I should try and show my face later on. 
The salon, right? OK, I'll head over there by myself. 
…Is that so?! Even though I came here just to invite you?! 
Fine, Ogami. Go by yourself for all I care! …I'm leaving! 
Uh-oh… I made her angry, didn't I? 
Hey, Sumire. What's with that sullen face of yours? 
Ensign… I'm in something of a rotten mood at the moment. 
About Kanna? <br> About the play? <br> About me? 
I’m guessing… this is about Kanna, right? 
…Yes. You're quite perceptive. 
I thought you two had made peace with each other recently? 
This is an issue I have with the casting. It's a completely separate matter. 
How on earth could Yoneda cast Kanna as the lead, and I as the villain?! 
I’m guessing… this is about the play, right? 
That's exactly it! Perceptive as always, Ensign. That saves me the need to explain! 
Curse Yoneda, that crusty old man! He's been casting me in nothing but supporting roles as of late… 
It's as though he has no eye for talent whatsoever! 
How dare he! <br> I don't think that's true. 
How dare he! Someone of your talents ought to be given better roles. 
… 
What's the matter, Sumire? 
It's just… your sentiments have made me quite happy. 
But it would be unbecoming of me to accept pity from others. 
It's extremely embarrassing that you have seen me in such a pathetic state. 
Sumire… 
If I want to remain at the top I have to stop complaining. 
Ensign… I do appreciate you taking the time to speak with me. 
Thanks to you, the path I must walk has become clear to me. Well then, please excuse me. 
I don't think that's true. 
What was that, Ensign? Whatever do you mean? 
This may sound patronizing coming from someone who knows next to nothing about theater, but… 
No matter how good the lead actor is, you couldn't put on a play without a supporting cast. 
The Demoness is a splendid role and I don't think there's anyone who could pull it off like you, Sumire. 
Ensign… you've made your point quite well. 
I was mistaken. A splendid supporting role… it's just as you said. 
And someone who excels at playing supporting roles is the real power on the stage! 
Right! That’s Exactly what I wanted to say. 
Thank you so very much, Ensign. Speaking with you has lifted my spirits. 
Well then, I will make my way to the salon. Please do drop by later. 
…I wonder if my advice was of any use? 
… 
What is it, Ensign? Don't just stand there and say nothing! 
Well, I know next to nothing about theater… and I wasn't sure whether I should butt in… 
…I'm sorry that I bothered you with my complaints, Ensign. 
But, well… I loved you as the Demoness, Sumire. It was very… you. 
Is… Is that so? 
Indeed, complaining about the role I was cast is unbefitting of a star actress like myself. 
Thank you so very much, Ensign. Speaking with you has lifted my spirits. 
Well then, I will make my way to the salon. Please do drop by later. 
…I wonder if my advice was of any use? 
… 
What is it, Ensign? You turned silent all of a sudden. 
Well, I suppose my ill mood has nothing to do with you. 
Please, do excuse me. 
…I was just wondering why I always end up getting the short end of the stick! 
…So you're upset about role distribution for the shows? 
Oh, Ensign… it's not as if I'm angry at YOU or anything. 
After all, we two are friends, right? 
Of… Of course. 
…It's true I was a tiny bit unhappy with the roles I've been getting lately… 
But I shouldn't bother you with my complaints… Please excuse me. 
So she was unhappy with her roles? Sounds complicated… 
Aren't you being a little too self-conscious? 
Oh, erm… So I was wrong? Hahaha… 
I see, I have ruined the mood. Please excuse me, I'll go ahead. 
Hmmm… I wonder what that was all about. 
I was really surprised earlier seeing that side of Maria… 
Ahh! Ma… Maria!? 
Captain! I… 
(Oh… That costume. Where have I seen it before…?) 
(Could it be… isn't that the outfit Sakura wore for her role as the French city girl?) 
Captain… this is… 
(Maria seems uncharacteristically nervous.) 
(She's not as intimidating as usual. I guess underneath it all she's just a normal girl.) 
(She looks flustered…) 
(I've never seen her this anxious before…) 
Captain… please don't look at me like that. 
I-I'm sorry! It's my fault… I shouldn't have entered the women's dressing room in the first place. 
A gentleman as always, I see. I am grateful for your sincere apology. 
But… I mean… It's really me who is to blame. 
I was just sorting through the costumes when Sakura's outfit fell into my hands. 
It looked so cute and… Well… I just… 
That was unprofessional of me. Please forget about this. 
I understand, it's all right. 
Captain… Please, do not speak of this to anyone. Promise me. 
W-Well then… I'll take my leave. 
All right, I'll see you later. 
Who'd have thought Maria would ever act like that? 
So underneath her usual exterior, she's just a girl after all. 
Maria… What are you doing? 
Captain… I was sorting the costumes and I came across Sakura's outfit… 
And then, well… 
This is a really cute dress, so I… 
It really suits you. <br> You startled me. <br> It's a bit small… 
It really suits you. 
C-Captain, please don't tease me like that! 
I'm not joking around at all. You are a woman after all, you should wear clothes like this more often. 
What? No… Things like this don't suit me at all. 
Nonsense… You’re really beautiful, so you should dress up every now and then! 
…I'm just not used to… 
You startled me, Maria. 
I-I'm sorry to have caught you off-guard… 
It's fine, you really don't need to apologize. There’s nothing wrong with you wanting to wear something girly. 
But… 
You're beautiful, Maria… so… I think you would look fantastic wearing a more feminine outfit like that one. 
…Is that so? It's hard for me to tell, so… 
It's a little small on you but… 
You're right… These girly clothes don't really suit me at all, do they? 
I think your normal appearance suits you best after all. 
I-Is that so? You're right… 
… 
Umm… Captain…? 
Ah… I was staring… Maria, those clothes really suit you, don't they? 
That's… Don't tease me like that, Captain… 
I wasn't teasing you. You're beautiful, Maria. You should wear feminine clothes more often. 
That's impossible for me. Besides, the patrons all expect me to dress like a man, right? 
Really? Well, there certainly isn't anyone that plays the male roles as well as you do. 
No… that's not what I mean… 
Well then… Captain… 
…What is it, Maria? 
You won't tell anyone else about this, will you? 
Hmmm, but what if I did? <br> It's our secret. <br> It'll make for good gossip! 
Hmmm, but what if I did? 
C-Captain!! 
It was a joke! Just a joke. I'll keep this a secret. 
I'd be happy if you would. 
All right… then it'll be just between the two of us. 
…Thank you. I just got carried away a bit after the show. 
Well, I think getting carried away might actually be good for you. Relax a little. 
Really…? Hehe, maybe you’re right. 
This will make for some good gossip! 
Captain… people with loose lips don't tend to live for very long… 
(Gulp…) 
No, no! Haha. It was just a joke! A joke! 
… 
… 
It's ah… It's quite all right, Captain. Please don't worry so much. 
W-Well then… I'll take my leave. 
All right, I'll see you later. 
Who'd have thought Maria would ever act like that? 
So underneath that exterior, she's just a girl after all. 
Kasumi is leading the patrons out of the theater. 
She seems busy, so I won't bother her. 
Oh… it's Kasumi. 
Ogami, nice work today. 
You as well. But… What are you doing here? 
I'm escorting the guests to the exit. 
We've closed off the doors so that the guests don't wander off into the rest of the building. 
Would you be so kind as to use the other staircase if you want to go to the second floor? 
Really? What a bother. 
Haha, sorry, but we can't have our guests leave through the wrong exit. That would be even more bothersome. 
True enough, being a guide to our guests certainly is an important responsibility. 
…OK. I'll use the other staircase to get to the second floor. Keep up the good work. 
Thank you very much. And thank you for all your hard work today as well, Ogami. 
Kohran must have gone to the salon by now. She's not here either. 
This is Kohran's room. 
Who could that be… I'm… a little tied up right now… Hold on, gimme a sec… 
Open the door anyway. 
…Hmmmm. This wire should go here, right? And… Come on! Get in there! 
All right, I'm coming in! 
Kohran, what're you up to? 
Shh! …I'm in the middle of making a totally new type of robot… 
I'm trying to connect a really important wire right now… I can't concentrate so… can you stop being so nosy? 
What kind of robot? <br> I'm not going to say a word. <br> You're building noses? 
Wow… What kind of robot? 
Didn't I just tell you to shut your trap for one second?! Aaaah… 
Wh-What's wrong? 
Ah… Damn it… 
Don't worry. I'm not gonna say a single word. 
That was nine words just there! Aaah… 
Wh-What's wrong? 
Ah… Damn it… 
You're building noses? 
You dimwitted…! What are you talking about?! I said "nosey"! 
Oh, I just shoved it right in without thinking about it! 
K-Kohran! If you scream like that… 
Ah… Damn it… 
… 
…Thanks a bunch, Ogami. 
At this part of the construction, even the smallest distraction can lead to a grave mistake. 
So, thanks for… Whoa! 
Wh-What's wrong? 
Ah… Damn it… 
*cough*… *cough*! 
What the hell! Now "Party Boy" has gone bust! 
A-Are you all right, Kohran? 
Noooo! I'd fitted him with a steam processor that could do both sides of a double act routine… 
He was equipped with an arm just for card tricks… He had the body of a stripper and the mind of a philosopher… 
And now my Party Boy, an entertainment robot built to perform party routines from 12 countries, lies in pieces… 
Didn't I tell you not to distract me?! 
Thanks to you I connected the wrong wire and boom! There he goes! 
S-Sorry… 
I slaved away on him for a month! What a mess… I'll go see the others. 
Chief… Next time someone tells you to shut up, you better listen. Please, I mean it… 
I'll go and meet up with the others. They're probably in the salon. You better not follow me! 
What are you talking about? What is this "Party Boy"? 
Today was the last show of the summer season. And I promised I'd have him ready for the celebrations… 
For an entire month I spent my nights working to create the perfect party trick robot… 
Oh, dear Party Boy… Please forgive me. 
And I was SO close to finishing it! I'm such an idiot! 
Kohran… I'm sorry about your robot, but the most important thing is that you didn't get hurt… 
If you'd been hurt, there'd be no celebration at all. So, I'm really glad. 
Oh, cut it out… You're gonna make me blush… 
I… I think I better go to the salon… and meet with the others… 
Oh, and… I'm really sorry you had to witness this disaster… Sorry. 
Nonsense! But… I really would have liked to see Party Boy in action. 
… 
In that case, I'm gonna show you a little secret later. You can look forward to it! 
And off she goes… What did she mean by "secret"? 
I'm coming in, Kohran… 
Kohran… What do you think you're doing? 
C-Chief!? How long have you been here? 
Ah… Damn it… 
Would you look at this freakin' mess! Now my Party Boy's in pieces! 
A-Are you all right, Kohran? 
Chief!! Don't just enter someone else's room like that! 
You made me drop my screwdriver, and now look! This disaster is your fault! 
I didn't do it on purpose. <br> Kohran, are you hurt? <br> Party Boy? 
Sorry, I didn't do it on purpose. 
Well, of course not. That would have made it even worse! 
What were you even thinking just coming in here without asking? 
I'm sorry… 
Don't you "sorry" me! Just look what you did to Party Boy! He's a pile of bolts now! 
There's no way I'll ever be able to fix him again… This is bad. 
Kohran, are you hurt? 
I'm fine. But look! Look what happened to Party Boy… He's in a million pieces! 
I'm sorry… 
Don't you "sorry" me! We're lucky he was just an entertainment robot. 
If I'd been working on my Spirit Energy Bomb, all of Ginza might be gone now. 
"Party Boy"? What's that? 
Hm? You wanna know about Party Boy? 
See these pieces everywhere? That's the most advanced entertainment robot the world has ever seen. 
Entertainment robot? 
Yes! Glorious bringer of fun and lightener of moods at even the most boring of parties! 
Thanks to his steam processor he was able to simulate both sides of a double act routine… 
Depending on the situation, his body was able to transform in sixteen different ways! 
A customized card-trick arm, a family-friendly exotic dance function, and even an automatic tip collector! 
Thanks to my "life of the party" circuitry, his tricks would have become ever wilder! 
And on top of that… 
OK, OK, I get it! I'm really sorry. 
Well… Maybe I got carried away a bit, but anyway, you need to be more careful! 
… 
… 
Come on, Chief! You don't have to make such a serious face. 
You can always fix something that's broken. 
But really… exercising the bare minimum of decorum shouldn't be too hard. 
Ahh… I'm really, really sorry. 
From now on, you oughta be careful when entering other people's rooms. Got it, Chief?! 
Y-Yeah. 
Hmph… Well, I promised I'd meet everyone in the salon, so I'll be going. Later, Chief. 
I wonder if Ayame is in her room. 
I guess I'll try somewhere else. 
It's Ogami… do you have a moment? 
Oh, Ogami? Come right in. How can I help you? 
Excuse me. 
Ayame! The performance just ended so… 
If you'd like… would you uh… Would you like to go out to dinner with me or something? 
Oh! You came here to invite me out? Thank you, Ogami. 
I'm happy but… I've still got a report to write. I'm really sorry. 
Anyway, everyone is probably gathering in the salon by now. 
Please head over there while I quickly finish up this report. I'm sure everyone is waiting for you. 
Oh, Ogami. Welcome. 
Let's talk about something fun. 
All right. 
Do you need me for anything? 
(She's got her scarf pinned with a brooch.) 
(I wonder what it's made of… Couldn't be a real jewel, right?) 
…Are you interested in this brooch? Oh, hey, listen to this, I actually got it super cheap at a bargain sale. 
… 
(The way Yuri's hair curls away from her face is so charming…) 
(That bouncy look is pretty trendy.) 
Is something odd about my hair? Oh no~, I've got some split ends! 
(She's got a nice, small face. I think even a model would be jealous…) 
(It doesn't seem like she uses much make-up. Well, she's got a nice foundation, I don't think she needs it…) 
What's wrong, Ogami? You've been staring at my face for a while. Haha, you're in love with me, aren't you!
Hey now… You shouldn't tease adults! 
Hehehe… Sorry, Ogami. 
(Her eyes are shining with curiosity.) 
(Yumi's got a reputation for loving juicy gossip…) 
Hey, Ogami. Have you heard any good rumors lately? 
(Her clothes are pretty colorful.) 
Do you like this outfit? It's called the “bus guide” look. It's really popular right now. 
(Goodness… that's certainly an aggressive neckline…) 
(But… isn't this supposed to be a uniform?) 
Ahaha. I see you've been stricken by my allure! 
Hey, hey! 
Recently, there have been a lot more reports of monster attacks. 
Really? 
Just a while ago there was a report of a cat-sized monster around the Suehirocho depot. 
I just hope this doesn't turn into something really bad… 
After we finish our summer performances, the theater is opened up for public use. 
There will be all sorts of attractions, including a special preview of “The Three Musketeers.” 
It’s a film directed by Fred Niblo and starring Douglas Fairbanks… You should definitely check it out! 
So Ogami, how are things going with Kanna? 
What do you mean? 
I mean something happened between you two at Fukagawa, right? 
No… not really. 
Oh come on, seriously? You guys are no fun! 
Hey now… 
Finally, we're done for the summer! I can't believe I missed the summer festival and the Sumida River fireworks. 
Yeah, summer's almost over… 
I need to get out and buy some new clothes for the fall. I wonder what will be popular this year? 
Sumire hasn't been near the prop room ever since you guys went to Fukagawa. 
Hmm? Why? 
Well, think about it. There's all sorts of stuff here and in that room. Seems like the kind of place you'd find… 
Find what? Oh… I get it. 
Looks like you and Sakura have been hitting it off lately, Ogami. 
Sakura's popular with just about everyone. I think it's because she comes off as nice and approachable. 
Looks like you and Sumire have been hitting it off lately, Ogami. 
Most people see her as hard to approach, but they also feel that's what makes her attractive. 
She's always getting bouquets from young guys from the upper class. 
Ogami, seems like you've been pretty friendly with Maria lately. 
Maria's fans basically fall into two groups. Either they're young students or girls. 
Ogami, seems like you've been pretty friendly with Iris lately. 
It's pretty obvious what makes Iris popular. Most of her fans are older folks. 
Seems like you've gotten pretty close to Kohran lately, huh, Ogami? 
Honestly… I really don't get where Kohran's popularity comes from… 
Seems like you've gotten pretty close to Kanna lately, huh, Ogami? 
Kanna's really popular with children. 
Do you need something? 
(That ribbon in her hair… it really suits her.) 
(I'd say that's an attractive feature to go with Kasumi's mature looks.) 
(Not a hair out of place.) 
(She really does have beautiful hair… She must spend a lot of time getting ready every day.) 
(Kasumi has a very calm expression…) 
(She looks gentle, but I bet she's scary if you make her angry… She's kind of the reliable older sister type.) 
…Is something the matter, Ogami? 
Oh, no, it's nothing, Kasumi. 
(There's a quiet, calm look in her eyes.) 
(Kasumi always looks people right in the eyes when she talks to them.) 
(Those traditional Japanese clothes look great on her.) 
(Her demeanor is so calm, but her movements have no openings I can see… I wonder if she has experience with martial arts.) 
(Gotta love the chest areas on traditional Japanese clothes…) 
…
(She's actually got quite a…) 
Ogami! This is really inappropriate… 
Oh, sorry… 
Thanks for all your hard work, Ogami. 
Hey, you've been working hard too. I'm glad we're finally done with the summer performance. 
It'll be nice to have some time to relax. We'll actually be taking time off starting tomorrow. 
Though it's a little late to call it a summer break. 
The summer performance went over very well. I think the children in particular really enjoyed it. 
My goodness. I'm glad that's finally over. Thanks for all the help, Ogami. 
But we're going to need to start preparation for the next performance right away… 
What are we doing next? 
Sumire's going to star in "Inferno of the Naga." 
She hasn't been the main star for a while, so she's in high spirits. 
So she's going to play a snake woman… I think she'll be pretty popular. 
Good work out there, Ogami. 
Hey, Tsubaki. Thanks. You too. 
We're finally done with the summer performance. There were a ton of kids here today, so it was pretty wild. 
Are you done for the day, Tsubaki? 
Yep, and starting tomorrow I'm taking a few days off. 
Oh, Ogami. Did you need something else? 
(A shopkeeper's outfit. Tsubaki looks good in it.) 
H-Hey, Ogami! Where do you think you're looking? Stop! 
Ogami… come on, don't stare at me like that. It's embarrassing. 
Is there something on my face? 
Thanks for your business! Come again! 
Hello? …I see. Thanks for doing that. We've got our processor working on it too. 
I see, so they're wedges… OK, we'll try running that through our processor. 
The Flower Division? Right now they're throwing a party, I think. They should be fine. 
…Yes. We should see some results soon… Thanks… 
I wonder if the manager is around. 
I guess I'll try somewhere else. 
Zzz… zzz… zzz… zzz… 
He's sleeping pretty deeply, he seems peaceful. 
It's Ogami… do you have a moment? 
Oh, Ogami. Yeah, come on in. 
Excuse me. 
Commander, what was that phone call about, just now? 
Huh? Whaddya mean? 
Well… just now… 
What? I wasn't talking on the phone or anything. Are you hearing things? 
If you say so… 
Hey Ogami. Once the party's over, go buy me some drinks, OK? 
Then bring 'em on down to the Command Room. I'll pay you back there. 
Uh… OK. 
All right. Dismissed. 
Yes, sir… Wait, what? Why the Command Room? 
Is Ayame around? 
I guess I'll try somewhere else. 
Looks like Ayame isn't back yet. 
Oh, Ogami. Did you need me for something? 
Oh, yes. I wanted to speak with you. 
…I'm afraid I'm a little busy right now. Sorry. 
Dang it. I came here just to talk to her. 
Well, nothing to be done. Let's go somewhere else. 
It's Ogami… do you have a moment? 
Oh, Ogami? Come right in. How can I help you? 
Excuse me. 
Everyone's planning to throw a party, so I was wondering… 
Would you like to go with me? 
You came here just to personally invite me? Why thank you, Ogami. 
I'm flattered, but unfortunately I still have reports I need to finish. Sorry. 
I think you'll all have more fun if us older folks stay out of it. 
Don't say that! You're still way too young to be one of the “older folks,” Ayame. 
Haha… Well thank you, Ogami. You're quite talented at flattery. 
Setting that aside, is there anything you'd like to discuss with me as the leader of the Flower Division? 
Situation Report <br> Member Report <br> It's nothing 
I'd like to hear about how our last battle impacted the area, please. 
You did a great job quickly wrapping up the battle. You have a good grasp of the strengths of your division. 
We will continue to expect great things from you as a leader. 
Thankfully there were no civilian homes nearby during this last battle, but… 
You must remember that the longer a battle drags on, the more damage is done to the surrounding area. 
Please try to keep that in mind, and plan a strategy that will eliminate all threats as quickly as possible. 
I'd like to hear about the casualties from the last battle. 
Ogami… 
In a seven-person team, even lacking one member is an extraordinarily large loss, don't you agree? 
Though we should be grateful their life was spared. 
Sakura certainly isn’t weak, but she also isn’t the strongest. She shouldn't be sent without proper support. 
Sumire has excellent combat capabilities, but you mustn't overestimate her. She needs proper support. 
Maria's defenses are weak, so you should avoid placing her in close-quarters combat situations. 
Kanna has the strength to fight in close-quarters combat. She's cut out for the front lines. 
Iris was angry. She still can't fight by herself, so we have to protect her… 
Kohran's attack skills are weak, but she can do range attacks. Make sure you understand that, Ogami. 
As captain, you must provide support. Your aid is what will strengthen the unit's bonds. 
We took quite a lot of damage… You need to provide better support or your comrades will lose their faith in you 
We took far too much damage in that last battle. You need to make better use of everyone's talents. 
If you keep handling battles this way… Well, let's set that aside. 
There were no casualties to the Flower Division. Well done, Ogami. 
I think you made excellent use of the Flower Division during the Fukagawa battle. 
Your evaluation of the battle and tactical decisions were spot on. 
That doesn't mean the war is over, though. 
Ah, we should discuss which member defeated the most enemies. 
The one with the most enemies shot down during the last battle was Sakura. 
If there are several enemies lined up in single file, Sakura's special attack can shine. 
Just give her the right orders. It's important to base your movement on enemy positions. 
The one with the most enemies shot down during the last battle was Sumire. 
Sumire's special attack is useful when you're surrounded by enemies. 
However, that doesn't mean you should send her off alone. 
The one with the most enemies shot down during the last battle was Maria. 
Maria should take up the rear. She's the most suited for firing from behind. 
There certainly won't be any friendly fire from her, right? 
The one with the most enemies shot down during the last battle was Kanna. 
Kanna has powerful attacks, so she can fight at the front line, but her abilities are wasted in the rear guard. 
The one with the most enemies shot down during the last battle was Iris. 
She can move around fast, so it's a good strategy to have her support all the others. 
The one with the most enemies shot down during the last battle was Kohran. 
Her bombs have a wide area of effect. Let her aim at clusters of enemies. 
She was absolutely wonderful! 
That means she trusts you as a captain, Ogami. 
You think so? Well, thank you, ma'am. 
I think that's all there is to report about that. Did you need anything else? 
No, thank you, ma'am. 
It seems Kanna and Sumire have changed somewhat since they returned. 
You think so? I haven't really noticed anything. 
Oh, they've definitely changed. I suppose they aren't showing on the surface, though. 
I think they've accepted one another, deep down… They've become a little more honest about their feelings.
And you're the one who brought about this change, Ogami. 
Me? But I didn't do anything. 
I wonder about that… hehe. 
Keep up the good work, Ensign. 
…Doesn't look like Yuri's here. I think maybe she was helping a lost kid or something. 
I should try another room. 
Hey there, Ogami. We're finally done with the summer performance. 
I'm on duty today. 
Kasumi and Tsubaki are out getting a bite at Renga. I wish I was with them. 
Aw man, that's too bad. Well, see you around. 
Do you need me for anything? 
(She's got her scarf pinned with a brooch.) 
(I wonder what it's made of… Couldn't be a real jewel, right?) 
…Are you interested in this brooch? Oh, hey, listen to this, I actually got it super cheap at a bargain sale. 
…
(The way Yuri's hair curls away from her face is so charming…)
(That bouncy look is pretty trendy.) 
Is something odd about my hair? Oh no…! I've got some split ends! 
(She's got a nice, small face. I think even a model would be jealous…) 
(It doesn't seem like she uses make-up. Well, she's got such a nice foundation, I don't think she really needs it…) 
What's wrong, Ogami? You've been staring at my face for a while. Haha, you're in love with me, aren't you! 
Hey now… You shouldn't tease adults!  
Hehehe… Sorry, Ogami. 
(Her eyes are shining with curiosity.) 
(Yumi's got a reputation for loving juicy gossip…) 
Hey, Ogami. Have you heard any good rumors lately? 
(Her clothes are pretty colorful.) 
Do you like this outfit? It's called the 'bus guide' look. It's really popular right now. 
(Goodness… that's certainly an aggressive neckline…) 
(But… isn't this supposed to be a uniform?) 
Ahaha, Ogami. I see you've been stricken by my allure!  
Hey, hey! 
Recently, there have been a lot more reports of monster attacks. 
Really? 
Just a while ago there was a report of a cat-sized monster around the Suehirocho depot. 
I just hope this doesn't turn into something really bad… 
After we finish our summer performances, the theater is opened up for public use. 
There are early movie screenings and things like that. It's used for all sorts of entertainment purposes! 
They're actually doing an advance screening of “The Three Musketeers” this time. 
Directed by Fred Niblo and starring Douglas Fairbanks… You should definitely check it out! 
So Ogami, how are things going with Kanna? 
What do you mean? 
I mean something happened between you two at Fukagawa, right? 
No… not really. 
Oh come on, seriously? You guys are no fun! 
Hey now… 
Finally, we're done for the summer! I can't believe I missed the summer festival and the Sumida River fireworks. 
Yeah, summer's almost over… 
I need to get out and buy some new clothing for the fall. I wonder what will be popular this year? 
Sumire hasn't been near the prop room ever since you guys went to Fukagawa. 
Hmm? Why? 
Well, think about it. There's all sorts of stuff here and in that room. Seems like the kind of place you'd find… 
…Find what? Oh… I get it. 
Ogami, seems like you've been pretty friendly with Sakura lately. 
Sakura's popular with just about everyone. I think it's because she comes off as nice and approachable. 
Ogami, seems like you've been pretty friendly with Sumire lately. 
Most people see her as hard to approach, but they also feel that's what makes her attractive. 
She's always getting bouquets from young guys from the upper class. 
Ogami, seems like you've been pretty friendly with Maria lately. 
Maria's fans basically fall into two groups. Either they're young students or girls. 
Looks like you and Iris have been hitting it off lately, Ogami. 
It's pretty obvious what makes Iris popular. Most of her fans are older folks. 
Seems like you've gotten pretty close to Kohran lately, huh, Ogami? 
Honestly… I really don't get where Kohran's popularity comes from… 
Seems like you've gotten pretty close to Kanna lately, huh, Ogami? 
Kanna's really popular with children. 
I expect that you will not fail me, Miroku? 
Indeed not… leave everything to me. Their headquarters are within my sights… 
Only one ley line remains! Our Hexagram of Infernal Calling nears its completion! 
The Imperial capital shall be destroyed by the fires of judgment unlike anything the world has ever seen. 
We'll burn the corruption the West has brought to Japan! 
And from the ashes, the Tokugawa Shogunate shall rise reborn! 
Go now! Strike down all that is westernized! 
At your bidding, Master. 
Your word is my command… 
Yes…
