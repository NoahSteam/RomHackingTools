It's a photo of Sakura. She's looking right at me. I wonder what she's thinking...
It's a photo of Sumire. This is a side of her you don't see too often.
It's a photo of Maria. ...She's lost in thought and looks kind of sad...
A photo of Kanna. Kanna's signature strength comes through clearly.
A photo of Iris. She's surrounded by flowers and flashing a radiant smile.
A photo of Kohran. She's looking pretty in profile with her face dyed red by the evening sun.
A letter given to me by a patron. I was asked to give it to Sumire. I have a bad feeling about this...
Maria's pistol. This may help me escape from here...
A hair ornament. It's decorated with flowers and looks very elegant.
A pretty pendant. The delicate workmanship is gorgeous.
A hairpin for use in a traditional bun hairstyle. It would complement a formal outfit well.
This key will let me enter rooms I couldn't before.
I found this in a bedroom on the second floor. I can use it to access the back room.
A teacup Iris asked me to get for her. It has a very stylish design.
This is the matchbox Iris asked for. Its logo is quite colorful.
A knife Iris asked me to get for her. Just a normal utensil you'd use during a meal.
A prop sword and shield used onstage. They're well-made and look just like the real thing.
A prop crown used onstage. It's well-constructed and incredibly detailed.
A wig and costume used onstage. I wonder what kind of act could use a flashy outfit like this?
A photo of Sakura in her swimsuit. Wow, this is really something. I'm gonna treasure this.
A photo of Sumire in her stage costume. Her distinctive makeup really makes an impact.
It's a photo of Maria on stage in the military uniform from "For Love"... She's a beautiful woman disguised as a man.
A photo of Kanna in her training gear. Catching her in a private moment like this feels surprisingly intimate.
A photo of Iris in her swimsuit. She's holding a rubber ring and looks ready to have some fun. How cute.
A photo of Kohran. I don't get to see her with her braids undone very often. It's a nice look.
A photo of Ayame in a traditional outfit. I hope she'll always be as happy and content as she is here.
Ayame's gun. Why...? Why did it have to turn out like this...?
Jean-Paul the teddy bear. Iris's best friend. She always carries him with her and takes good care of him.
(...If you look closely, she's still wearing her stage hairdo.)
(...She must have come here in a big hurry after the play ended.)
(As always, that's some wild hair.)
(It's Kanna's trademark headband. It always looks so good on her.)
(I've heard that the store even sells "Kanna's headbands" marketed to children.)
(Wow...You don't usually see Kanna looking like this.)
(I wonder what happened here...? Kanna's got a troubled look in her eyes.)
(I wonder if she ran out of time... Her clothes are all over the place)
(Why was Kanna in such a rush?)
(Oho?! Maybe it's my imagination, but it seems like I can see more than usual...)
(No! I can't believe I'm staring at Kanna's chest when she's in trouble...What am I doing?!)
(O-oh nooo! My eyes are drawn like a magnet to her breasts!)
Captain...What exactly are you looking at?!

Phew... coming back to your room after a job well done feels good.
...nothing going on here either. I should try and meet up with everyone else.
Huh...I wonder if Sakura is in her room.

I'm finally free from my ticketing duties now that the show is over.
I guess I'll rest my weary bones today.
Even the regular customers came and greeted me.
I guess I'm the only one here familiar with it then...
Even after the curtain falls and last of the audience has left, I can still feel the enthusiasm of the stage...
What is everyone doing, I wonder. They must have gathered in the salon by now.
There's nobody here. The performance has already ended but no one's come yet.
Nothing to do here. I'll check somewhere else.
I can still feel the energy from the performance in the air.
I guess it's about time to go.

The show is almost finished so it makes sense that no one's practicing here.
... I guess I'll go somewhere else.
Swimming is only for summer. I thought someone might be swimming but...

Ahhhhh, I'm beat. Anyway, what should I do now?
Get in touch with Tsubaki.<br>Go back to my room. <br> Go meet up with everyone.
Today's job is to finish this and get in contact with Tsubaki.
Ah, Ogami! Great work today. Will you be finishing soon?
Yup, I'll be leaving soon.
Thanks for your hard work todaaaay!
(No matter when I see her, Tsubaki is always so energetic)
What's wrong Ogami? You were staring at me a little...
(Tsubaki is always energetic, isn't she? She doesn't seem even a little tired)
Are you alright Ogami? You look a little dazed. Aren't you tired?
We've finished the job but I'd like to see you more, Tsubaki.
Eeh? We have to see out the customers. This is the busiest time of the night!
That's true....Well then, I'll get out of your hair.
Go back to your room.<br>Invite Tsubaki to eat with you.<br>Meet up with everyone.
Well then, I'll be heading out.
Thanks for all your hard work! Oh, and! Everyone from the Flower Division should be in the salon!
Everyone gave their all in today's performance so please give them some kind words, ok?
I'll do that. Anyway, keep up the good work.
Eh! Really?! Ah...well...what should I do...?
What's wrong?
Actually...I had promised Kasumi that I would go eat with her at Renga.
Oh really...Well, if you've got a prior engagement then there's nothing we can do about it.
I'm very sorry! I've already made plans this but please invite me out again soon!
Alright...next time it is! Well, I'll be going then.
It's a promise then! And again, thank you for your hard work today!
If that's all, I'm heading home.
Thanks for all your hard work! Oh, and! Everyone from the Flower Division should be in the salon!
Everyone gave their all in today's performance so please give them some kind words, ok?

What's wrong Ogami? You look a little out of it.
Hey Miss! Give me that picture!
Yes, welcome! Kanna Kirishima's picture, right? That'll be 50 zeni please!
We'll be performing a new shown in the fall, so please come see us again!
You look busy...I'll head out now. Keep up the hard work, ok?
Of course. Thank you for working hard as well.
Phew....I'm beat. I'll go back to my room and take a rest.
Alright, I guess I should meet up with everyone and at least show my face.
Everyone should be relaxing near the salon after they finish changing.
Ahh...No good...I'm really sleepy all of a sudden.
Well, it seems like we've finished collected ticket stubs so let's head out.
Well you're surprisingly close to Tsubaki, aren't you Ogami?!
Huh!? S-Sakura! W-when did you get here!?
Hmph! I had just come here to look for you.
Looking for...m-me...?
After the summer performance finished we were planning to have an after party with everyone from the Flower Brigade but...
I'll just have to tell everyone that you'll be absent due to your dinner with Tsubaki!
Hey! W-wait a minute!
She didn't accept my invitation anyway<br>That was just a joke!<br>Hey, listen to me for a second!
She didn't accept my invitation. She had already made other plans...
So if she hadn't made plans in advance then you'd be going to eat with her? I can't believe it!
You can't believe it? It's just going for dinner...
That doesn't matter! And to think I came here to invite you to the after party...I'll be taking my leave!
Oh...She's gone...She came here just to ask me to join her and now this...what a bummer.
Oh, that was just a joke! I wasn't being serious.
I didn't take you for the type to invite girls out as a joke!
Well, I came here to invite you to the after party but...Just kidding! I'll be taking my leave.
Oh...She's gone...She came here just to ask me to join her and now this...what a bummer.
Sakura! Please wait! Just listen to me for a minute.
What is it? What did you want to tell me?
Tsubaki was quite busy during the close ceremonies today, right? I just thought it would be nice to treat her to dinner.
Then that's when you called me. This isn't a fib or a joke...I'm being serious.
I understand. I can believe that.
You're so kind Ogami. But sometimes...that kindness...
Hmm? My kindness...?
No, no. It's nothing. Anyway...
Since our summer performance is over we're having a big after party with everyone!
Please come and at least show your face.
Thank you, of course I'll go. Where is everyone meeting?
Everyone is resting in the salon now. Anyway, I'll be going now.
(Right, the after party....Regardless, I'm glad I was able to avoid a fight with Sakura)
...
What is it? If you don't have anything to say to me then please don't call after me!
...I'll be taking my leave.
Ah! She left. I guess I made her angry...What a bummer.
I'll have to apologize later.
Uncle Ichi!! You came to peep at me, didn't you!?
I don't have any ulterior motives or anything!<br>...I've been caught<br>I was just worried so I came to check up on you!
You're mistaken! I don't have any ulterior motives or anything like that!
Liar! Uncle Ichi is dirty!
D-dirty?
Pervert!
Degenerate!
What are you saying? And why do you know that word?!
I-i dunno!
Ah! Iris! ...She left...Well that's a shame.
...I've been caught, have I? Oh well, what can you do, ahahah.
Grrrrrrr! Uncle Ichi is such an idiot! Pervert! Dirty old man! I can't believe this!
Uggh! Get out of here!
Are you kidding me? This is the second time this has happened! This is too much.
Woah, It looks like Iris teleported me here.
I was worried about you, Iris.
...!?
I was passing by the change rooms are heard you screaming...
I was worried that something had happened so ran here as quickly as I could.
...Reeeeally?
Really.
REALLY really?
Really really.
Aww! I believe you!
(Phew...)
But...Uncle Ichi. You're lucky it was me...if it were someone else then....
They might've been super duper man! Be careful, ok?
Anyway, I'm gonna go meet up with everyone else! Bye~Bee~!
S-she's right...I'd better be careful.
...
Uncle Ichi...Don't make that face!
I'm not angry, okie?
I'm sorry, Iris. It was a little careless of me to run in here like that.
No, no, it's OK Uncle Ichi.
Anyway, I'm gonna go meet up with everyone else! Bye~Bee~!
I'm sorry I made you worry Uncle Ichi.
It's ok, really. I just heard your screams and thought something might've happened to you.
Honestly, I'm just glad it wasn't anything serious.
Actually, I was a little surprised when I heard Uncle Ichi's voice but...
I'm so happy that Uncle Ichi would worry about me like that!
Hahaha. Next time make sure you don't mix up the hot and cold water, ok?
Okaaaay! Anyway, I'm gonna go meet up with everyone else!
Hey, come on! I'm totally innocent!
Ahhh, that was refreshing! Huh? Uncle Ichiro, what's wrong?
I should be asking you that. I was walking through the corridor and heard quite the scream coming from your room.
....Huh? Ohhhh....
I mixed up the hot and cold water so I shouted...Maybe that's what you heard?
Are you kidding me? I'm glad I didn't rush in here.
I think Uncle Ichi just wanted to come into my room, isn't that right?
That's not it at all.<br>...You're right.<br>I'll leave it up your your imagination.
That's not it at all. I wasn't trying to catch a peek or anything.
Uncle Ichi...
W-what?! Hold on a second...Why are you mad Iris?
Hmph! You don't want to see me naked! Isn't that right?
Well...Uh...
Hmph! Stupid Uncle Ichi!
Phew. She left but...why was she mad at me?!
Well if I'm being honest....I wanted to take a peek.
Ufufu! I knew it! Uncle Ichi is a pervert!
......
Aww, Uncle Ichi's being shy! How cuuuute!
Well...Uh...
Next time....Let's get in together! OK Uncle Ichi?
...Hey now!
Anyway, I'm gonna go meet up with everyone else! Bye~Bee~!
Ahh....this is no good. What am I saying?!
...I'll leave that to your imagination.
You were just itching to come to my room, weren't you Uncle Ichi?
......
See?! I knew it!
I-iris! Hold on a second!
Don't be shy, don't be shy!
Anyway, I'm gonna go meet up with everyone else! Bye~Bee~!
I....I can't deny it though...Maybe I did want to sneak in... I'm scaring myself.
...
See! You're thinking about it, aren't you? You wanted to sneak a peek!
N-no, actually...
It would've be fine if you came in y'know?
H-hey! I-iris! You shouldn't tease adults like that!
Don't be shy! Don't be shy!
Anyway, I'm gonna go meet up with everyone else! Bye~Bee~!
She's right though....I was thinking about it...I'm scaring myself.
Kyaaaaah!!
Huh!? That scream...That was Iris! It sounded like it was coming from the change rooms.
Hurry to the change rooms<br>Shout "What's Wrong!?".
Iris isn't here?! That must mean...the shower room?!
Damnit...What should I do!?
Hurry to the shower room.<br>Shout "What's wrong!?".
Iris isn't here either! Maybe she's in the shower room? Uh-oh...

Iris! Are you alright?!
Huh?! Oh! Uncle Ichi! Get out of here!
Huh? What the!? Uwaaaaaah!
Woah....Apparently I've been teleported here by Iris...
I wanted to go and help her but...I've been mistaken for a peeping tom...
Iris! What's wrong?! Are you Ok~ay!?
Huh!? That voice...Uncle Ichi?! Uncle Ichi, what's wrong?
I heard someone screaming and thought something me wrong!
Well...uh...I...I thought I would take a shower but I accidentally mixed up the hot and cold water.
I got super surprised and shouted real loud.
Are you kidding? That's it...? I was more surprised than you were!
I'm sorry Uncle Ichi. Were you worried about me~?
Of course I was!
Reeeally...? Hehehe, I'm happy.
Well, it was nothing after all. I'm glad it was nothing big.
I was worried about you but...I was a little nervous to enter the shower room.
First thing's first, I need to figure out what's going on.

Well, we can't just leave the poor kids alone, right?
All right! Having the Boss around is as good as having a hundred average guys! Let's do it!

Hmm? Me? ...Kind? Boss...

Boss! You don't look like you're doing anything important. Can you give me a hand with a little something?
Huh? H-hey! Don't say I look bored, alright?
Fine, fine, I'll stop ribbing you so hard. Anyway, the kids seem a little anxious, we should help them out!
I can't compete with you, can I? Got it, I'll help too!

I know you aren't that kind of guy Boss. Alright! Let's help these kids out.
...Got it! Let's help them out!
All right! Having the Boss around is as good as having a hundred average men! Let's do it, Boss!
Ogami, Kanna! Thank you so very much for helping me today.
It sure took a while, didn't it?
Don't worry about that one bit! You two really saved me by helping me out today.
Exactly, Kanna. Sure it took some but at least all the kids were able to meet their parents.
That's true. I'm really grateful for everyone's help.
As expected from the Boss! Your judgement and memory are fantastic!
It's nothing really. I'm just relieved all the kids were able to meet their parents.
I know it well...what it feels like to lose sight of your parents...
I was left behind, wasn't I? I've gotta stop thinking like that or I'll start crying.
I don't want the kids who came to see the Hanagumi's performance to think something like that.
Allowing them to come to this theater and make good memories together...That's my most important job.
Our memories are precious, aren't they?<br> Fighting is an important job too.<br> That's just like you, Kanna.
Our memories are precious, aren't they?
Exactly. We can give those kids a dream to work towards.
Even if bad things happen, they can think back on our performance
Every time I stand there up on the stage I always think of how I wish I could show them.
Untranslated
No, not at all. Actually, it was really fantastic.
Untranslated
Well, I'd better get going then. Everyone should be in the salon by now.
Boss....thank you for helping me.
That's true. But fighting is still our most important job.
Of course! Protecting everyone from evil is the the Imperial Revue's most important job!
Everything that's precious to these kids...their precious people, town, dreams. I'll try to protect it all!
Maybe I showed off a little too much?
No, not at all. Actually, it was really fantastic.
R-really? I appreciate it but flattery will get you nowhere.
Well, I'd better get going then. Everyone should be in the salon by now.
Boss....thank you for helping me.

You scared me, Maria.

It's fine, you really don't need to apologize. You're a girl after all.
But how...
You're so pretty Maria...so...even wearing those girly clothes you look fantastic.
...Is that so? It's hard for me to tell so...
It's a little small on you but...
You're right...These girly clothes don't really suit me at all, do they?
I think your normal appears suits you best after all.
I-is that so? You're right...
......
Umm....Captain...?
Ah...I was staring...Maria, those clothes really suit you, don't they?
That's....Don't tease me like that Captain...
I wasn't teasing you. You're beautiful Maria, you should wear more feminine clothes more often.
That's impossible for me. Besides, the viewers all expect me to dress like a man, right?
Is that so? Well, I guess there's no one else who could fill your role, Maria.
It's not...It's not like that Captain...
Well then....Captain...
....What is it, Maria?
You won't tell anyone else about this, will you?
Hmmm, but what if I did?? <br> It's our secret. <br> This will make for some good gossip!
Hmmm, but what if I did??
C-captain!!
It was a joke! Just a joke. I'll keep this a secret.
I'd be happy if you would.
Alright...then it'll be just between the two of us.

This is Kohran's room.
Who could that be.... I'm....a little tied up right now...Hold on...Gimme a sec...
Open the door without hesitation. <br>
....Hmmmm. This wire should go here, right? And...Come on! Get in there!
Alright, I'm coming in!
Kohran, what're you up to?
Shh! ...I'm in the middle of making a totally new type of robot

Ahh....I'm really, really sorry.
From now you should be careful when entering other people's rooms, got it Ogami?!
Y...yeah.
Hmph....Well, I promised I'd meet everyone in the salon so I'll be going. Later Ogami
Is Ayame around?
I guess I'll try somewhere else.
It's Ogami...do you have a moment?
Oh, Ogami? Come right in. How can I help you?
Excuse me.
Ayame! The performance just ended so...
If you'd like...would you uh...would you want to grab dinner with me or something?
Oh! You came here to invite me out? Thank you, Ogami.
I'm happy but...I've still got a report to write. I'm really sorry.
Anyway, everyone is probably gathering in the salon by now.
Please head over there while I quickly finish up this report. I'm sure everyone is waiting for you.
Oh, Ogami. Welcome.
Let's talk about something fun.
Alright.
Do you need me for anything?
(She's got her scarf pinned with a brooch.)
(I wonder what it's made of... Couldn't be a real jewel, right?)
... are you interested in this brooch? Oh, hey, listen to this, I actually got it super cheap at a bargain sale.
......
(The way Yuri's hair curls away from her face is one of her charm points...)
(That bouncy look is pretty trendy.)
Is something odd about my hair? Oh no~, I've got some split ends!
(She's got a nice, small face. I think even a model would be jealous...)
(It doesn't seem like she uses a lot of make-up. Well, she's got such a nice foundation, I don't think she really needs it...)
What's the matter, Ogami? You're staring at my face... Oh, I see. You've fallen for me, right?
Hey, you shouldn't tease your elders!
Hehehe... sorry, Ogami.
(Her eyes are shining with curiosity.)
(Yumi's got a reputation for loving juicy gossip...)
Hey, Ogami. Have you heard any good rumors lately?
(Her clothes are pretty colorful.)
Do you like this outfit? It's called the 'bus guide' look. It's really popular right now.
(Goodness... that's certainly an aggressive neckline...)
(But... isn't this supposed to be a uniform?)
Ahaha, Ogami. I see you've been stricken by my allure~!
Hey! Hey!
Recently there have been a lot more reports of monster attacks.
Really?
Just a while ago there was a report of a cat-sized monster around the Suehirocho depot.
I just hope this doesn't turn into something really bad...
After we finish our summer performances, the theater is opened up for public use.
There will be all sorts of attractions, including a special preview of The Three Musketeers.
Directed by Fred Niblo and starring Douglas Fairbanks... you should definitely check it out!
So Ogami, how are things going with Kanna?
What do you mean?
I mean something happened between you two at Fukagawa, right?
No... not really.
Oh come on, seriously? You guys are no fun!
Hey now...
Finally, we're done for the summer! I can't believe I missed the summer festival and the Sumida River fireworks.
Yeah, summer's almost over...
I need to get out and buy some new clothing for the fall. I wonder what will be popular this year?
Sumire hasn't been near the prop room ever since you guys went to Fukagawa.
Hmm? Why?
Well think about it. There's all sorts of stuff piled here and there in that room. Seems like the kind of place you'd find...
Find what? Oh... Oh, I get it.
Looks like you and Sakura have been hitting it off lately, Ogami.
Sakura's popular with just about everyone. I think it's because she comes off as nice and approachable.
Looks like you and Sumire have been hitting it off lately, Ogami.
Most people see her as hard to approach, but they also feel that's what makes her attractive.
She's always getting bouquets from young guys from the upper class.
Looks like you and Maria have been hitting it off lately, Ogami.
Maria's fans basically fall into two groups. Either they're young students or girls.
Looks like you and Iris have been hitting it off lately, Ogami.
It's pretty obvious what makes Iris popular. Most of her fans are older folks.
Seems like you've gotten pretty close to Kohran lately, huh, Ogami?
Honestly... I really don't get where Kohran-san's popularity comes from...
Seems like you've gotten pretty close to Kanna lately, huh, Ogami?
Kanna's really popular with children.
Do you need something?
(That ribbon in her hair... it really suits her.)
(I'd say that's a good charm point to go with Kasumi's mature looks.)
(Not a hair out of place.)
(She really does have beautiful hair... she must spend a lot of time getting ready every day.)
(She's got such a serene expression on her face.)
(She looks nice, but I bet she's scary if you get her angry... She's kind of the reliable older sister type.)
... is something the matter, Ogami?
Oh, no, it's nothing, Kasumi.
(There's a quiet, calm look in her eyes.)
(Kasumi always looks people right in the eyes when she talks to them.)
(Those traditional Japanese clothes look great on her.)
(Even though she appears relaxed, I can't see any openings in her stance... I wonder if she's had martial training?)
(Gotta love the chest areas on traditional Japanese clothes...)
......
(She's actually got quite a...)
Ogami! Please, I'd rather you didn't...
Oh, sorry...
Thanks for all your hard work, Ogami.
Hey, you've been working hard too. I'm glad we're finally done with the summer performance.
It'll be nice to have some time to relax. We'll actually be taking time off starting tomorrow.
Though it's a little late to call it a summer break.
The summer performance went over very well. I think the children in particular really enjoyed it.
My goodness. I'm glad that's finally over. Thanks for all the help, Ogami.
But we're going to need to start preparation for the next performance right away...
What are we doing next?
Sumire's going to star in: "Inferno of the Naga".
She hasn't been the main star for a while, so she's in high spirits.
So she's going to play a snake woman... I think she'll be pretty popular.
Good work out there, Ogami.
Hey, Tsubaki. Thanks. You too.
We're finally done with the summer performance. There were a ton of kids here today so it was pretty wild.
Are you done for the day, Tsubaki?
Yep, and starting tomorrow I'm taking a few days off.
Oh, Ogami. Did you need something else?
(A shopkeeper's outfit. Tsubaki looks good in it.)
H, hey, Ogami! Where do you think you're looking? Stop!
Ogami... come on, don't stare at me like that. It's embarrassing.
Is there something on my face?
Thanks for your business! Come again!
Hello? ... I see. Thanks for doing that. We've got our processor working on it too.
I see, so they're wedges... Okay, we'll try running that through our processor.
The Flower Division? Right now they're throwing a party, I think. They should be fine.
... yes. We should see some results soon.... thanks...
I wonder if the manager is around.
I guess I'll try somewhere else.
Zzzzzzzzzzzzzz
He's sleeping so well. It looks nice.
It's Ogami...do you have a moment?
Oh, Ogami. Yeah, come on in.
Excuse me.
Chief, what was that phone call about, just now?
Huh? Whaddya mean?
Well... just now...
What? I wasn't talking on the phone or anything. Are you hearing things?
Absolutely...
Hey Ogami. Once the party's over go buy me some drinks, okay?
Then bring it on down to the control room. I'll pay you back there.
Uh... okay.
Alright. Dismissed.
Yes, sir.... Wait, what? Why the control room?
Is Ayame around?
I guess I'll try somewhere else.
Looks like Ayame isn't back yet.
Oh, Ogami. Did you need me for something?
Oh, yes. I wanted to speak with you.
... I'm afraid I'm a little busy right now. Sorry.
Dang it. I came here just to talk to her.
Well nothing to be done, lets go.
It's Ogami...do you have a moment?
Oh, Ogami? Come right in. How can I help you?
Excuse me.
Everyone's planning to throw a party, so I was wondering...
Would you like to go with me?
You came here just to personally invite me? Why thank you, Ogami.
I'm flattered, but unfortunately I still have reports I need to finish. Sorry.
I think you'll all have more fun if us older folks stay out of it.
Don't say that! You're still way too young to be one of the 'older folks', Ayame.
Haha... well thank you, Ogami. You're quite talented at flattery.
Setting that aside for the moment, is there anything you'd like to discuss with me as the leader of the Flower Division?
Situation Report<br>Member Report<br>It's nothing
I'd like to hear about how our last battle impacted the area, please.
You did a splendid job of wrapping this last battle up quickly. You have a good grasp of the strengths of your division.
We will continue to expect great things of you as a leader.
Thankfully there were no civilian homes nearby during this last battle, but...
You must remember that the longer a battle drags on, the more damage is done to the surrounding area.
Please try to keep that in mind, and plan a strategy that will eliminate all threats as quickly as possible.
I'd like to hear about the casualties from the last battle.
Ogami...
In the 7-person Flower Troupe, even lacking one member is an extraordinarily large loss, don't you agree?
Though we should be grateful their life was spared.
Sakura's capabilities are by no means lacking, but neither are they particularly excellent. She should not be sent out without proper support.
Sumire has excellent combat capabilities, but you mustn't overestimate her. She needs proper support.
Maria's defenses are weak, so you should avoid placing her in close-quarters combat situations.
Kanna has the strength to fight one or two of even our Flower Troupe members in close-quarters combat. She's cut out to be an advance guard.
Iris was angry. She still can't fight by herself, so we have to protect her...
Kohran's attack skills are weak, but she can do range attacks. Make sure you understand that, Ogami.
As the commanding officer, you must provide sufficient support. Your aid is what will strengthen the bonds of the unit.
We took a lot of damage... You need to take better care of your subordinates or you'll lose their trust.
We took far too much damage in that last battle. You need to make better use of everyone's talents.
If you keep handling battles this way... well, let's set that aside
There were no casualties to the Flower Division. Well done, Ogami.
I think you made excellent use of the Flower Division during the Fukagawa battle.
Your evaluation of the battle and tactical decisions were spot on.

However, that doesn't mean you should send her off alone.
The one with the most enemies shot down during the last battle was Maria.
Maria should take up the rear. She's the most suited for firing from behind.
There definitely won't be any friendly fire if it's her, right?
The one with the most enemies shot down during the last battle was Kanna.
Kanna has great attacking skills so she can battle at the front line. However, this means she is not fit as a back-line fighter.

It seems Kanna and Sumire have changed somewhat since they returned.
You think so? I haven't really noticed anything.
Oh they've definitely changed. I suppose they aren't showing on the surface, though.
Untranslated
And you're the one who brought about this change, Ogami.
Me? But I didn't do anything.
I wonder about that... haha
Keep up the good work, Ensign.
... doesn't look like Yuri's here. I think maybe she was helping a lost kid or something.
I should try another room.
Hey there, Ogami. We're finally done with the summer performance.
I'm on duty today.
Kasumi and Tsubaki are out getting a bite at the Renga. I wish I was with them.
Aw man, that's too bad. Well, see you around.
