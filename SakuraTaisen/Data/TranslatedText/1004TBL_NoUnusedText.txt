Ah... gh... grhhh... aghhh 
Ahhhghh.... Mi... chael... 
Come home with me, Satan. Our Father, which dwells in Heaven, awaits you. 
Michael... are you saying that I am forgiven? 
God's time is eternal, as is His love. 
There is no sin so great it cannot be washed clean. 
Michael. 
You're not alone. Come. 
Nraggggh!! Silence!! 
I apologize for nothing! I regret nothing! Not my rebellion against Father, nor my fall to Hell! 
The 'love' of Heaven is not but a falsehood! I will never understand our Father's tolerance for these humans! 
That is why I kill, that is why I spread misery, that is why I will destroy this living world!! 
You see nothing but the present!! 
But no love will be born from this day! There will no longer be a Heaven above!! 
Humans are more suited for living in fear, trembling in darkness and despair! Haha... HAHAHA!! 
I will withdraw for now. But, as long as humans exist, I shall be reborn time and time again!! 
Satan! Return with me!! 
I don't need Heaven's light!! I have lived by the sword, and now I will die by the sword!! 
Satan... 
Thank you, Imperial Combat Revue. 
But, sadly this does not mean an end to the fighting. 
Your true fight is just beginning.

Farewell, everyone. 
Hey! That's not a face a man should make. Pull yourself together! 
That is more acceptable. 
Fare thee well, Ogami.
