﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿It's a photo of Sakura. She's looking right at me. I wonder what she's thinking…
It's a photo of Sumire. This is a side of her you don't see too often.

A photo of Kohran. She's looking pretty in profile with her face dyed red by the evening sun.
A letter given to me by a customer. I was asked to give it to Sumire. I have a bad feeling about this…
Maria's pistol. This may help me escape from here…
A hair ornament. It's decorated with flowers and looks very elegant.
A pretty pendant. The delicate workmanship is gorgeous.
A hairpin for use in a traditional bun hairstyle. It would complement a formal outfit well.
This key will let me enter rooms I couldn't before.
I found this in a bedroom on the second floor. I can use it to access the back room.
A set of cups Iris asked me to get for her. They have a very stylish design.
This is the matchbox Iris asked for. Its logo is quite colorful.
Some knives Iris asked me to get for her. Just a normal utensil you'd use during a meal.
A prop sword and shield used onstage. They're well-made and look just like the real thing.
A prop crown used onstage. It's well constructed and incredibly detailed.
A wig and costume used onstage. I wonder what kind of act could use a flashy outfit like this?

A photo of Sumire in her stage costume. Her distinctive makeup really makes an impact.
It's a photo of Maria on stage in the military uniform from "For Love"… She's a beautiful woman disguised as a man.
A photo of Kanna in her training gear. Catching her in a private moment like this feels surprisingly intimate.
A photo of Iris in her swimsuit. She's holding a rubber ring and looks ready to have some fun. How cute.
A photo of Kohran. I don't get to see her with her braids undone very often. It's a nice look.
A photo of Ayame in a traditional outfit. I hope she'll always be as happy and content as she is here.
Ayame's gun. Why…? Why did it have to turn out like this…?
Jean-Paul the teddy bear. Iris's best friend. She always carries him with her and takes good care of him.
The Mikasa! <br> Commander Yoneda… <br> Did we do it? 
We… Did we win? 
Y-Yes, we won! 
Wha… What!? 
I… have returned… I am sin, I am darkness. I am eternal. I am the snake of old. 
The original rebel, who shunned our almighty father. My name is… 
Satan!! 
So that's Cerulean Satan's true form? 
Th-That's Satan! Is this… Is this how the world will be destroyed? 
Th-That's Satan! Is this… Is this how the world will be destroyed? 
Th-That's Satan! Is this… Is this how the world will be destroyed?

Th-That's Satan! Is this… Is this how the world will be destroyed? 
Yeah… You're right! We won't let him get away with this! 
No matter how desperate things look, we won't give up! We will be victorious in the end! 
The lives of all the people in the world depend on us! 
Ugh! 
!? 
A… Ayame? 
Michael… the Archangel? 
But… I can't… I lost so many people… that were very dear to me… 
…! 
…Huh!?

Lieutenant General! Energy levels in the Spirit Cannon are rising fast! 
What?! 
Third main cannon, destroyed! All the main cannons are now gone!
The main engine is overheating! 
We can't continue fighting! If we go on, the Spirit Cannon will…! 
Very well… Evacuate! 
Lieutenant General! 
What about you, sir? Aren't you coming? 
Me? Ha! I have one last trump card left… 
Huh!?… Impossible! 
Evacuate now! 
Lieutenant General! 
Get out of here! 
Y-Yes, sir! 
Ohoho… You've given me a nice place to die a soldier's death, Ayame! 
I have to thank you! 
All engines, full power! Our target is… the Sacred Demon Castle! 
Don't underestimate us humans! 
Attaaaaaaack! 
The high angel Lucifer, archangel of the highest stratum, the being said to be closest to God… 
He used his boundless power to rebel against his heavenly father… And after a ferocious battle, he was defeated. 
The Lord cast Lucifer down from the heavens, and far he fell to the bottom of the earth. 
This was how Hell came into being. 
And thus, Lucifer became the perennial opponent to God… He was reborn as Satan, King of Devils. 
Come forth…! 
The time of judgment has arrived… This world will be cast into the darkness of beginning. 
Cry, you heavens! Quake, you lands! Today is the day that brings the Great Darkness! 
Today, our wish will finally be fulfilled!

We must not lose heart! That would be like selling your soul to the devil!

Let there be… light… 
Stand up… 
No, I am the lord of angels, Michael the Archangel. 
I have walked with Satan on his path, drenched in immeasurable sin, and I have led him… 
When Satan returns, so will I… 
I was sealed in the body of this person. 
Stand up now. If you desire to save the world, get up and stand on your own two legs! 
Bringing justice can be a terrible thing. Sometimes blood has to be spilled. 
But what counts is an unwavering spirit… 
And a loving heart. If you have those two, you cannot lose! 
No matter what stands in your way… The light of hope lives in people's hearts. 
Now go… and fight for all that is good! 
I pray that our heavenly Father will grant you His blessings.
