Imperial Navy Ensign Ogami-san Ichiro:
As part of a special mission, you are hereby ordered to take up a new post as captain of the following corps:
'The Imperial Floral Assault Group, Anti-Demon Interception Squad, Flower-Troupe.'
Furthermore, your mission is a highly-classified one for the sake of the defense of Teito.
You are to head to Ueno Park to join up with the corps. 
Imperial Army Lieutenant General. <br> <sp> <sp> <sp> <sp> <sp> <sp> <sp> ~Yoneda Ikki
……Ogami Ichiro.  As of today, you will be transferring to the Imperial Floral Assault Group, Flower-Troupe.
Yes, sir!  Ogami Ichiro, prepared to work to the utmost limits of my abilities, sir!
Yes……  Excellent reply.
A politician such as myself can not discuss the military secrets of the Floral Assault Group with you here.
For further detail, ask Lieutenant General Yoneda. He is the commanding secretary of the Imperial Floral Assault Group.
Now then, head for Ueno Park.  I expect you to live up to the expectations I had when I recommended you as captain.
Understood, sir!  Ogami Ichiro, now proceeding to Ueno Park!
The sanctity of Teito rests in your hands.  Do your best.
Yes, sir!
Ah, what nice weather!  And the Ueno cherry blossoms are in full bloom.
Now then…… Where do you suppose the meeting place is……? I guess I'll try walking around a bit more.
That reminds me……  I believe Ueno Park was where that monster disturbance happened just a while ago……
Apparently, the one who cut down that monster, with one blow, was a young girl……
……………………
He said someone from the Imperial Floral Assault Group would come to meet me; when do you suppose they'll show up?
What's this?  That girl……
…!  She's coming this way……
Ye-yes.  I happen to be Ogami…
Um…  Forgive me, but, who might you be?
……From Lieutenant General Yoneda?
(I'd heard someone would be coming to meet me…… but I never would have expected it to be a woman……)
Um, excuse me…… would you happen to be from the Imperial Floral Assault Group!?
Ah……  I'm Imperial Navy Ensign Ogami Ichiro.
Still…… to think a young woman like yourself would be a member of the squad……  Frankly, I'm a little surprised.
Ah, n-no……  It's not that……
(……I suppose only in a covert squad would it not be unusual to find female squad members like her……)
Eh - theater…… you say!?
I'm on duty! <br> First I'd like to know more about you.
I'm on duty!  Unfortunately I don't have time to spend seeing a play.
Ehh!?  The base of a covert squad is inside a theater!?  That can't be……  No, wait a second?
In order to conceal oneself from the enemy's eyes, first do so from one's allies.  I see.
First I'd like to know more about you.
I see - that's an excellent attitude.  I'm relieved to hear those words.  That is how a member of a secret corps should be.
……That would mean the Imperial Floral Assault Group has something like a secret weapon, wouldn't it?
(Kohbu?  Ahh…… the name of the secret weapon.  I wonder what sort of thing it is.)
Ye-yes!  If you would, please.
(Why do I need to go to a theater……?)
(Is she really…… a member of the Imperial Floral Assault Group?)
O-oh, no!  It-it's nothing!
(It couldn't be…… I'm overthinking this.  This girl knew my name, didn't she?)
Ye-yes!  If you would, please.
So this is the Grand Imperial Theater that was newly built last year…..  I never would have expected it to be right in the middle of Ginza……
It's a big building……
Surely, no one would notice that the headquarters of a covert squad are inside a theater like this……
Wow……  What an impressive entrance way.  Still, it seems a bit careless not to have a lookout posted……
Still…… it's rather quiet, isn't it.
(Performing at night? <br> ……Does she mean nighttime drills?)
Huh!?
(Wh…… who is this kid!?)
Ah…… I'm…… Imperial Navy Ensign, Ogami Ichiro.
(A child like this…… is a member of a covert squad?)
J……just what was that girl all about?
Sakura's left, too……  That's no good.
There's nothing I can do about it.  I guess I'll just go see Lieutenant General Yoneda myself......
……Who could that be?  It sounded like a voice just came from the dining hall……
(Wah! <br>  ……Wh-what a bold outfit!)
……My-myself, you mean!?
Ye- yes, ma'am……
Why should I have to do such a thing……? <br> Why, certainly.
Why should I have to do such a thing……?  I refuse!
In the first place, that's no way to make a request of someone!
……I happen to be Imperial Navy Ensign Ogami Ichiro, transferred as of today to the Imperial Floral Assault Group.<br>
Fired you may say, but without a decree from the Navy's General Headquarters, I cannot leave.
…………!
……Ogami. <br> Um, where might Lieutenant General Yoneda be?
Through this way? <br> Thank you very much.
Why, certainly. <br>  ……Here, there you are.
(Huh……?)
……I happen to be Imperial Navy Ensign Ogami Ichiro, transferred as of today to the Imperial Floral Assault Group.
I wish to personally convey the message to Lieutenant General Yoneda……
…………!
Waah! <br> Wh-what are you doing all of a sudden!?!
Um, excuse me…… <br> Wh-where might Lieutenant General Yoneda be!?
……It's Ogami.
Ye- yes, ma'am……
Why should I have to do such a thing……? I refuse!
In the first place, that's no way to make a request of someone!
(Haah?)
(That's all well and good for her to say all of a sudden, but…… just who is this woman!?)
I happen to be Imperial Navy Ensign Ogami Ichiro, transferred as of today to the Imperial Floral Assault Group.
Fired you may say, but without a decree from the Navy's General Headquarters, I cannot leave.
…………!
……Ogami. Um, where might Lieutenant General Yoneda be?
Through this way? <br> Thank you very much.
……So this is the office of the head secretary of the Imperial Floral Assault Group, his Excellency, Lieutenant General Yoneda……
Lieutenant General Yoneda…… An active strategist in the Russo-Japanese War…… What sort of a person is he?
Ah…… Forgive me. I'm Imperial Navy Ensign, Ogami Ichiro.
I would like to see his Excellency, Lieutenant General Yoneda……
Miss Maria Tachibana……
……She seemed a bit rigid. Still, at least I've finally met someone who seems to be a member of the army.
But, this training or whatever……? Is she practicing something?
Now then…… I can finally have an audience with his Excellency, Lieutenant General Yoneda.
Untranslated
(Nice body...)
(Is this the color they call platinum blonde?)
What pretty golden hair......
(So she's a foreigner…… Huh? But she was speaking Japanese just now.)
(I wonder what country she's from.)
Ah…… N- no!

……Excuse me!!
As of 12:00 today, Imperial Navy Ensign Ogami Ichiro, newly transferred to the Imperial Floral Assault Group,
Just now, arrived!
(Wh…… who is this drunken old man!?)
(Th……this man…… couldn't possibly be……!?)
Are you really…… his Excellency Lieutenant General Yoneda? <br> How can you drink sake in the middle of the day!
……Um…… are you…… really…… his Excellency Lieutenant General Yoneda?
Fo- forgive me!
How can you drink sake in the middle of the day?!
Are you really that Lieutenant General Yoneda? You seem quite different from the rumors I've heard……
I had heard Lieutenant General Yoneda was a hero of the Russo-Japanese War and the greatest strategist the Army has.
No…… <br> I hadn't said that much.
……I understand. But given that I have been transferred to the Imperial Floral Assault Group……
For the harmony and safety of the citizens of Teito…… I intend to fight with my life on the line!
……
I see…… So I'll be in disguise for this mission. That's just what I'd expect of a covert squad!
Understood! Ogami Ichiro, now proceeding to duty!
Yes, sir!
Ah, Ogami-san……
Ah…… found you.
Sakura and…… Iris, was it? What are you doing here?
Look, Sakura. This is why Iris said "we'd better run!"
……Well, you said, "let's go check on how he's doing," didn't you?!
And you said, "let's go, let's go!"
(……It seems the two of them were eavesdropping.)
It's not right to eavesdrop! <br> Tell me where the reception desk is.
Here, now!! It's not right to eavesdrop!
……I'm sorry.
What!? <br> And here Iris thought she'd show Onii-chan around!
Well Iris doesn't care about Onii-chan anymore! <br> So long, bye-bye!
Ah, Iris! Wait right there!
Call Iris back. <br> Have Sakura lead the way.
Wa- wait, Iris! I guess I said a little much. I'm sorry.
Sniff…… But, aren't you…… angry at Iris?
Ahh, what trouble you cause…… <br> Iris, don't cry. I'm not angry……
E-heh-heh, thanks. Onii-chan, you're real nice, huh.
……That Iris. Tricking us with crocodile tears…… What nerve.
By the way, I'm sure you two would know, but……
Could you tell me the way to the reception desk, I wonder? It's my first duty here.

I'm sorry…… <br> It's partly my fault for not being more careful.
I'm sorry. I'm worried about Iris, so…… forgive me.
Ah…… Just a second…… ……She's gone.
……That's no good. Here I've finally just received my first official duty and I don't even know where the reception desk is.
Ensign Ogami, is something the matter?
You're…… <br> Miss Maria Tachibana…… <br> right?
Yes, that's right. It seems you've already met with Manager Yoneda.
Yes. I've already received my first official duty. I was told to change into these clothes and head for the reception desk.
Until I get used to it, I think I'd like to learn about my job a little at a time.
I see. That's an excellent attitude.
By the way, do you happen to know where the reception desk is?
Ah…… that's right! And here I meant to ask how to get there……
……In that case, I'll show you the way.
Really? That would really help.
……It's a simple task. Please, come with me. It's very close.
Anyways…… I was wondering, could I perhaps trouble you to tell me where the reception desk is?
It's my first task here. I'd like to get to the reception desk as soon as possible.
Here, now! What are you making a fuss about in front of the manager's office!?
Ah…… you're-! <br> The one from earlier……
Hey, Maria, listen! <br> Sakura says……
All I said was that I'd show Ogami-san around, but Iris, here……
Both of you, stop that at once. It's almost time for practice to start, isn't it?
……As for the Ensign, I'll show him the way. You two head for the dressing room.
Oh, that's no fun.
Well then, Ogami-san…… Good luck with your work.
Now then, Ensign Ogami. I'll show you to the reception desk.
……Ye-yes, ma'am. If you would, please.
In that case, I'll lead the way. Come on, Ogami-san. Let's go.
No! Onii-chan is going with Iris! Let's go, Onii-chan!
Ask Iris to show the way. <br> Ask Sakura to show the way. <br> Ask both to show the way.

I'm sorry, Iris. I was being immature too.
No, it's all right. If everyone is going together, then Iris is happy.
Ha-ha-ha, now this is like having a flower in each hand. Well then, lead the way, if you would.
(Things look like they could get disastrous if I were to speaking judiciously…… I guess I'll just keep quiet.)
Here, now! What are you making a fuss about in front of the manager's office!?

Y-yes sir! Please hold on just a second!
(……Wasn't my mission to be captain of a covert squad?)
Customers! As for myself, I may be clipping tickets now, but in actuality, I am……
I am the captain of the Imperial Floral Assault Group! <br> ……I'm just in charge of clipping tickets.
The truth is, I am the captain of the Imperial Floral Assault Group, Flower-Division!
Huh??
There's no role of captain in the Flower-Troupe.
In the first place, there's no way you, a man, could be in the Flower-Troupe!
(……H-how can this be?! She doesn't believe me in the least!)
(No! <br> The Imperial Floral Assault Group, Flower-Troupe, is a secret corps…… I mustn't let its name slip!)
……Though I may be clipping tickets right now, the truth is…… I am in charge of clipping tickets, after all.
Sir, are you all right!? Ah! It's already this late! ThenFlower-Troupe's performance is going to start!
(She said "Flower-Troupe"…… Why would an ordinary person know the name of a covert squad……?)
(……No. As the captain of a secret corps I can't afford to say such foolish things.)
What an uncivil ticket-clipper! Ah! It's already this late! The Flower-Troupe's performance is going to start!
Untranslated
Uh, um……
Ah, sorry. The scissors, the scissors. ……All right, therenyou are.
Um…… Do you happen to like Kanzaki Sumire?
She's just my type. <br> I don't care much for her……
Yes, though I haven't talked to her much yet, she is the type I like.
Eh!? You've had the chance to talk with Sumire!? I really envy you……
Oh yea! Um…… Could you possibly deliver this letter to Sumire for me?
Just tell her it's from a huge fan of hers. Please!
Y-yes sir…… understood.
No, I don't care for her very much……
What did you say!? You don't understand that grace and elegance of hers!?
To think someone like you is working in this theater…… How deplorable a situation!
(I think the fact that an Ensign of the Imperial Navy is clippingntickets in a theater is pretty deplorable, too……)
I'm terribly sorry. I can't answer such questions.
……I see. Forgive me……
Um…… I'm…… a fan of Sumire. P-please, give her this letter!
W-well then, I've got to be going…… I'm begging you!
Ah, j-just a second! Please, wait!
(Hmm - just what sort of a letter…… is this?)
Hey! Ticket-clipper man, here's my ticket!
Ye- yes. Let's see…… now where do I clip a child's ticket?
Ah, this guy's new here! He doesn't even know how to clip tickets!
Handle the situation calmly. <br> Glare at the boy.
Here you are, boy. Here's your ticket.
Keep it up just like that.
(Wh-what an impertinent brat!)
Mister, do you think it's such a good idea to glare at your customers like that!?
(You brat…… Get lost already!)
What's the matter? Say something.
(Damn it…… you brat! Getting all cocky when I'm trying to keepnquiet!)
……No matter what, this is just too odd. Just what makes thisnticket-clipping a secret mission!?
……All right. If it's come down to this, I'll try hearing what the other squad members have to say. I may be able to learn something.
And if I'm not satisfied with that, I'll just have to question Lieutenant General Yoneda!
……Now then. Where should I go first?
Ye-yes. What is it?
Tsubaki, is it.
Hmm…… so she's a salesgirl. She's a rather energetic girl.
……Now then, where should I go?
…Excuse me…  Are you Ensign Ogami Ichiro?
I'm Shinguji Sakura.
I received instructions from Lieutenant General Yoneda to provide escort for an Ensign Ogami.
Yes!
Imperial Floral Assault Group, Flower-Troupe, Shinguji Sakura.
Pleased to make your acquaintance.
Do you find women difficult to rely on?
……Now then, let's proceed to the Grand Imperial Theatre.
You're mistaken.  Inside the Grand Imperial Theater is the Imperial Floral Assault Group headquarters.
The essentials of the art of war, indeed.
Now then, let's proceed.
About me, you say……?
Untranslated
I'm still causing trouble all the time for everyone in the Tei-Geki.
But in order to defend Teito, I intend to work hard even if it means placing my life on the line.
Making the 'Kohbu' work is a tough job.  But as fellow rookies, let's do our best together.
Come, Lieutenant General Yoneda is waiting!  Let's go!
Ogami-san, this is your first time here, isn't it.  Now then, let's go inside through the main lobby.
Untranslated
 Well, today we're only performing at night……
Ahah? <br> Onii-chan, are you Miss Sakura's boyfriend?
Iris! <br> You mustn't tease your elders.
This is Ensign Ogami Ichiro, newly transferred to the Imperial Floral Assault Group.
Imperial Floral Assault Group, Flower-Troupe, Iris.
And this is Jean-Paul, the bear, Iris's very special friend.  Get along nice with him.
Say, Sakura……
What's the matter?
This Onii-chan has spiritual energy too……  He'll be fighting in a 'Kohbu,' won't he.
That's right.
Iris…… hates war……
Untranslated
Don't worry, Iris.  Come on, let's go to your room.  I'll read to you from your Mother Goose book.
Okay.
Ah, Ensign Ogami.  Lieutenant General Yoneda is in the manager's office.
Well then, I will now be excusing myself.
Someone!  Please lend me a hand!
Ah!  You there!
Who else is there?  Stop looking like a fool and come here!
I wonder if you wouldn't perhaps pick up that dropped fork and exchange it for a new one for me?
My, then you mean to say I should pick it up myself?
You dare to suggest that the only daughter of Kanzaki Heavy Industries, and the star actress of this theater, and, and……
…the top lady of Japanese high society, I, Kanzaki Sumire, should pick up a fork dropped on the floor!?
That is what you are saying, is it not?! You are fired! I shall report this to the manager and see to it that you are fired!
Ah…… <br> My, oh, no…… <br> O-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho……
No wonder I thought I hadn't seen a waiter like you before…… <br> Forgive me.
Let's see - Ensign Ogawa, was it?
Untranslated

Mr. Yoneda is in the manager's office within.
Thank you.  By the way - I, the top star here, Kanzaki Sumire, have been cast aside…
…and before I was even aware, Miss Maria was made leader of our drama group.  What do you think of all this?
Honestly, that old fool Yoneda!  He has no eye for people!
Oh my, what shall I do!  How rude of me.  Ho-ho-ho-ho-ho……
Let's just keep what I said just now a secret from Mr. Yoneda!  Is that clear?  (Chu!)
Eh-heh, there's no need to be shy.  That was just to see that the favor's returned……  I mean, just to see you off.
Ahh, Mr. Yoneda is in the manager's office. But is this absolutely clear? You are not to mention what I just said to anyone!
Do you understand, Ensign Ogawa?!
Enough, begone!!
Who might you be?
So you're Ogami Ichiro, newly transferred to the Tei-Geki.
Pleased to meet you. <br> I'm Maria Tachibana.
Is there…… something on my face?
Lieutenant General Yoneda is in the manager's office. I have training, so if you'll excuse me……
And one more thing, just as a warning. You shouldn't stare at a woman's face! Now then, excuse me!
Hey, come on in.
Yeah, I heard the news from Count Hanakoji. Now then, there's no need for formality.
In the first place, y'know, this is the Grand Imperial Theater. You can't use that military talk.
Well, how 'bout a round!?
Idiot! <br> What's the big idea with this "are you really" bit!?
What's the matter, you can't figure out who a person is if he hasn't got any medals on?! I'm Army Lieutenant General Yoneda Ikki!
Damn fool!
Okay! As long as you understand, that's fine enough. Now then, I will now entrust you with your first mission!
Rumors……? <br> Hey, what sort of rumors!? Huh? Spit it out! 
The greatest strategist the Army has…… and, he's the manager of the Grand Imperial Theater.
And on top of that, <br> a drunken old man……
And that's what you don't like.
That is what you're saying! <br> But you know, Ogami-san……
No matter how much distinguished military service I've performed and how many medals hang from my chest, I've killed a whole lot of people.
Both enemies and allies…… <br> I've killed far too many.
So, what's wrong with this? Being the manager of a theater!
Splendid! Er, rather…… that's just splendid indeed! Now then, here's your first duty!
Why, you're a real uncivil fellow, aren't you. Well, no matter. Now then, here's your first duty!

Because when it comes down to it, this is a secret corps, after all.

Change into this and go to the reception desk! Hmph, in soldier's uniform like that you can't help standing out.
Hello? Excuse me.
