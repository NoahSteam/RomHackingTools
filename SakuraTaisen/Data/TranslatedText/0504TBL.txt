It's a photo of Sakura. She's looking right at me. I wonder what she's thinking…
It's a photo of Sumire. This is a side of her you don't see too often.
It's a photo of Maria. She's lost in thought and looks kind of sad…
A photo of Kanna. Her signature strength comes through clearly.
A photo of Iris. She's surrounded by flowers and flashing a radiant smile.
A photo of Kohran. She's looking pretty in profile with her face dyed red by the evening sun.
A letter given to me by a customer. I was asked to give it to Sumire. I have a bad feeling about this…
Maria's pistol. This may help me escape from here…
A hair ornament. It's decorated with flowers and looks very elegant.
A pretty pendant. The delicate workmanship is gorgeous.
A hairpin for use in a traditional bun hairstyle. It would complement a formal outfit well.
This key will let me enter rooms I couldn't before.
I found this in a bedroom on the second floor. I can use it to access the back room.
A set of cups Iris asked me to get for her. They have a very stylish design.
This is the matchbox Iris asked for. Its logo is quite colorful.
Some knives Iris asked me to get for her. Just a normal utensil you'd use during a meal.
A prop sword and shield used onstage. They're well-made and look just like the real thing.
A prop crown used onstage. It's well constructed and incredibly detailed.
A wig and costume used onstage. I wonder what kind of act could use a flashy outfit like this?
A photo of Sakura in her swimsuit. Wow, this is really something. I'm gonna treasure this.
A photo of Sumire in her stage costume. Her distinctive makeup really makes an impact.
It's a photo of Maria on stage in the military uniform from "For Love"… She's a beautiful woman disguised as a man.
A photo of Kanna in her training gear. Catching her in a private moment like this feels surprisingly intimate.
A photo of Iris in her swimsuit. She's holding a rubber ring and looks ready to have some fun. How cute.
A photo of Kohran. I don't get to see her with her braids undone very often. It's a nice look.
A photo of Ayame in a traditional outfit. I hope she'll always be as happy and content as she is here.
Ayame's gun. Why…? Why did it have to turn out like this…?
Jean-Paul the teddy bear. Iris's best friend. She always carries him with her and takes good care of him.
With my hair braided like this, it doesn't get in the way while I’m working. It's very convenient. 
(When you look from this angle… you can really tell she has a nice chest…) 
…Chief. What have you been looking at this whole time?
Uh, well… I was just thinking about how tough your work must be… 
Is that really your excuse for why you were eyeballing my boobs? 
(She's going to get mad at me again… I should stop staring at her.) 
Some oil has splattered on your uniform here and there. 
Staring at people's clothes like that… are you possessed or something? 
Kohran, don't you have work clothes? 
Don't worry! This battle garb is really tough. 
Really…? 
Everything's built-in from comms to knives. It can resist fire, water, obviously oil, and electricity too! 
Wow, that's amazing! 
Stubborn dirt comes off with just a wipe. Seriously, it makes for excellent work clothing! 
You're sweating a little. 
The Koubu are also fighting hard in every battle… so I need to keep them in tip-top shape. 
Your expression is so lively. You really love machines, don't you? 
Maybe it's because you've been tinkering with something you care so much about, but your eyes are sparkling. 
What's gotten into you? Starting into people's eyes… 
I was just thinking about how your eyes really light up when you’re working on machines…
Zip it, Chief! Seriously, I’m red as a tomato… but I'm happy too. 
When I have a moment, I want to read this book. 
But now’s not the time for reading. Let's head to the entrance. 
There's no point in returning to my room right now. Sumire and Kanna should be waiting at the entrance. 
Sakura should be in the War Room. 
I'd better hurry to the entrance too. 
It looks like no one is here. They must still be in the War Room. 
Kanna should already be at the entrance. 
I'd better hurry to the entrance too. 
Kanna, are you here…? It doesn't look like it. 
Maria should be in the War Room. 
I need to hurry up and join Sumire and Kanna at the entrance. 
…It doesn't look like anyone is here. 
I can hear the sounds of a heated discussion happening in the War Room. 
Kohran is in the underground hangar. 
I need to hurry up and join Sumire and Kanna at the entrance. 
She's not here. Kohran must still be in the hangar. 
Sumire is definitely at the entrance already. 
Sumire is waiting. I'd better get to the entrance. 
…Doesn't look like anyone is here after all. 
No one should be loafing around in the salon at a time like this. 
I'd better get to the entrance too. 
Ahh, you'd definitely get a tan if you stayed around here too long. 
If I don't hurry up and get to the entrance, they're going to complain. 
It’s pretty quiet around here… but, I guess that’s what happens after a performance ends. 
I'd better hurry to the entrance. 
The summer sunlight is coming in strong through the windows. 
I'd better hurry to the entrance. 
Since I've been at the Imperial Theater, it seems like this room has barely been used. 
I'd better hurry to the entrance. 
It gets pretty lonely in here whenever a performance ends. 
…Anyway, I wonder if those two are already at the entrance. 
This place is usually very lively, but now no one is here. 
I'd better hurry to the entrance. 
This room gets real quiet when there isn’t a performance going on. 
…Let's go! Sumire and Kanna are waiting at the entrance. 
No matter when I come here, this place always seems rather gloomy. 
I'd better get to the first-floor entrance. 
Did Kanna drop by here on her way out…? I guess not. 
I'd better get to the entrance. 
Maybe I should grab a quick bite. Can't work on an empty stomach… Huh, I kind of sounded like Kanna. 
…Ahh, this is bad! If I don't hurry and get to the entrance, they're going to complain. 
I'm pretty sure the meeting place was the entrance hall. 
This area is very lonely when there are no patrons. 
…Anyway, I wonder if those two are already at the entrance. 
The performance is over and the wings are completely silent. 
…I'd better get to the entrance. 
Looks like nobody is here. 
…I'd better get to the entrance. 
Even in the afternoon this storage room is pretty dark… 
…I'd better get to the entrance. 
Looks like nobody is here. 
Let's go! If I keep Sumire and Kanna waiting any longer, I’ll never hear the end of it… 
Hmm… Now that it's summer, I want to swim here as much as I can… 
However, if I don't hurry to the entrance, they're going to really complain. 
The air feels cool. Even in the summer, the basement is a pretty cold place. 
…Let's go! Sumire and Kanna are waiting at the entrance. 
Nobody here. 
However, if I don't hurry to the entrance, they're going to really complain. 
Nobody here. 
All right, let's hurry to where Sumire and Kanna are! 
I can faintly hear the sound of mechanical whirring coming from the steam processor room. 
I'd better hurry up and get to the entrance. 
The alarm isn't ringing at the moment, so nobody is here right now. 
Sakura and Maria are talking next door in the War Room. 
Better get to the entrance. 
Nobody here. 
Better get to the entrance. 
Oh, are you done? 
Oh, are you done?

Oh, I guess that's true. I'll come again some other time.

Hmm… Kohran's fanbase is a bit of a mystery. 
I'm here! 
Ensign Ogami, thank you for coming. 
Lieutenant General Yoneda has some news for you. Pay attention, Ogami. 
In Fukagawa, there is a former nobleman's mansion. It is currently unoccupied and has been abandoned for many years. 
Apparently, the Hive of Darkness is using it for some nefarious purpose. 
You mean the Fukagawa mansion? What would the Hive of Darkness want with that place? 
…We don’t know for sure. However, I have one theory as to their motives. 
And that is… sorcery. 
Did you say… sorcery? <br> Why investigate Fukagawa? <br> What's their motive? 
Why investigate Fukagawa? <br> What's their motive? 
What's their motive? 
Why investigate Fukagawa? 
Did you say… sorcery? <br> What's their motive? 
What's their motive? 
Did you say… sorcery? 
Did you say… sorcery? <br> Why investigate Fukagawa? 
Why investigate Fukagawa? 
Did you say… sorcery? 
Sorcery…? As in paper fortunes and yin-yangs? This is the Taisho era… 
Sorcery is not simply old-fashioned thinking, Ogami. 
It is supernatural explanations for things beyond science. The ancient power that underlies all history…
Perhaps the Hive of Darkness is planning to use some kind of sorcery to cast a spell on Tokyo. 
On the capital itself… 
Why investigate Fukagawa? 
Townspeople have reported that a suspicious group was seen around the abandoned mansion the other night. 
Something resembling a Hex Mech was also confirmed to be with the group so it was most likely the Hive.
But why Fukagawa…? 
Up till now, every location where the Hive of Darkness has appeared has been one of Tokyo's spiritual hot spots. 
Fukagawa may be an industrial zone now, but it was once a sacred place that was famous for its shrines and temples. 
The mansion may seem unremarkable to us, but there must be something there that the Hive wants. 
What exactly is their motive? 
To be honest… I haven’t a clue what their motive could be. 
C-Commander?! 
Now wait a minute, Ogami. Based on what we know about the Hive, we can make an educated guess. 
The Hive of Darkness is an organization aiming for the reinstatement of the Shogunate and the destruction of Tokyo. 
Consequently, attacking specific spots in the capital might hold some kind of profound significance. 
We don't have enough information yet, but this is the perfect time to look into our enemy's movements. 
Absolutely… 
Spying is not technically the responsibility of the Assault Troupe but… 
This is a great chance to learn more about what the Hive of Darkness is up to. 
It is vital that we understand the enemy's objective before we go on the offensive as well. 
Of course. Now I see why investigating the Fukagawa mansion is so important. 
We can't use the Koubu at the moment because Kohran is servicing them and making adjustments. 
Our mission is to spy and investigate. Don't do anything extreme. 
Commander, who is being sent to Fukagawa? 
Hm. This time the spy team will consist of Ogami, Sumire and Kanna. We'll limit it to three. 
What?! 
Me… and Sumire?! 
Sumire and Kanna?! <br> Understood! <br> I'd prefer Sakura though… 
Sumire and Kanna?! <br> Understood! <br> I'd prefer Maria though… 
Sumire and Kanna?! <br> Understood! <br> I'd prefer Iris though… 
Sumire and Kanna?! <br> Understood! <br> I'd prefer Kohran though… 
What! Sumire and Kanna?! But, why?! 
Both Maria and Sakura are researching new battle tactics, Kohran is servicing the Koubu… 
My hands are tied. Sumire and Kanna are the only people available for the mission. 
What about I-Iris? 
Hm… Iris is… 
Iris is…? 
It's her nap time. 
I'm so tiiired! 
Nap time?! 
…Therefore, at the moment, you three are the easiest members to move out. 
Understood! Sumire Kanzaki, Kanna Kirishima and myself. Together the three of us will head to the Fukagawa mansion. 
Yes, excellent. Good luck, Ogami. 
Ogami! Not feeling very motivated, are we? 
Y-Yes, of course! 
This isn't the time to dawdle. Honestly! 
I-I apologize. 
Commander Yoneda… Um… Why couldn't we take Sakura? 
If I have to take anyone, I think Sakura would be the best choice… 
Commander Yoneda… Um… Why couldn't we take Maria? 
If I have to take anyone, I think Maria would be the best choice… 
Commander Yoneda… Um… Why couldn't we take Iris? 
If I have to take anyone, I think Iris would be the best choice… 
Commander Yoneda… Um… Why couldn't we take Kohran? 
If I have to take anyone, I think Kohran would be the best choice… 
… 
Is that impossible? 
Ogami… I've thought long and hard about this. Please trust my judgment. 
Ogami… I'm asking you as well. 
Please take Sumire and Kanna with you to Fukagawa. 
Oh… Of course. 
…Well then. Get going, you three! 
Right! 
I'm not on board with it but… I concur. 
…
Kanna!! 
…Fine. Orders are orders. Let's go together. 
What's this? If you're going so begrudgingly, perhaps it would be better if you refrained from going at all. 
Shut up! You shut your mouth! 
(Man… are the three of us going to be OK?) 
Oh, Ensign? 
Gah! S-Sumire. 
(Well, this isn't good. This is worse than that time with Kanna…) 
Huh… That massive object behind you. Could it be… 
What the hell? You lookin’ for a fight?! 
Sumire, could you please cut it out! Hey, Kanna, you calm down too… 
Hmm. You two seem veeery close, don't you… 
This is a misunderstanding! <br> It doesn't mean anything… <br> Don't say things like that! 
Sumire, this is a misunderstanding! 
Oh, a misunderstanding? Which part am I misunderstanding? 
I only reached out to Kanna as her commanding officer. 
It's not relevant to whether we get along or not. 
Oh, I see. As a commanding officer, you took pity on poor Kanna. 
…! 
No, Sumire. It's not that I felt bad for her… 
Boss… I'm goin’ on ahead. See you. 
Aww, poor Kanna. I also pity you. 
Shut up! Just leave it, or are you lookin' to get smacked?! 
Waaa, I'm scared! Ogami, help meee. 
Tch…! 
Uh, wait, Kanna! 
(Not good… this level of animosity can't just be laughed off.) 
(There are only seven members of the Flower Division. It’s vital that we all work together…) 
…Ensign. Shall we head to the War Room? 
Uh, yeah. Let's go. 
No, Sumire! It doesn't mean anything… 
It doesn't? What reason do you have to be with Kanna, then? 
Uh, well… 
…What is this, Boss? You invited me, so there must be a reason! 
N-No, actually… 
…I should have known! You aren't a very forthcoming person, you know. I take my leave. 
…Boss. I'm goin’ on ahead… 
Aah, you two! Please wait…! 
…They left. I guess I might as well leave too. 
Sumire! You shouldn’t say things like that! 
Oh, is that so? 
Making random assumptions about people is really uncalled for! 
How can you draw conclusions about someone just because you saw them walking together? 
Oh, well excuse me. It appears I have been truly appalling. Forgive me! 
I wonder if I said too much. 
I think it was just enough for Princess Sumire. 
I wonder… 
…No one is going to refute it. Of course. 
I’m not liking your tone… 
The captain is tryin’ to be humble, and here you are mouthing off like that! Apologize! 
You’ve no right to demand apologies from me! 
Stop, both of you! Now is not the time for quarreling! 
…I’ll remember this! 
I could say the same thing to you! 
Oh, Boss! 
Gah! K-Kanna!! 
(Jeez, this is bad. Even worse than that time with Sumire…) 
Huh!? What are you doing together with this witch? 
Hmm… I get it. The two of you are taking a cozy walk together. Whatever. 
This is a misunderstanding! <br> This isn't what it… <br> Don't say things like that! 
Kanna, this is a misunderstanding! 
Oh, a misunderstanding! How’s that!? 
I only reached out to Sumire as her commanding officer… 
It's not relevant to whether we get along or not. 
Hmmm, I see. As captain, you were only feeling sorry for Sumire. 
…! 
Uh, no, Kanna. I didn't necessarily feel bad for her… 
Ensign… I'm taking my leave to go ahead. 
Oh ho ho. It looks like I've snatched him away. My bad. 
…
Ah, Sumire… I guess she left. 
(Not good… this level of animosity can't just be laughed off.) 
(There are only seven members of the Flower Division. It’s vital that we all work together…) 
…What do you want to do, Boss? We should get going. 
…Yes. 
No, Kanna! This isn't what it… 
It isn't? Then why were you with that witch? 
Uh, well… 
…What is going on, Ensign! You invited me, so you must have had a reason!? 
N-No, actually… 
…Jeez! I can't stand to be with you anymore! I'm going ahead! 
…Ensign. I will also go ahead… 
Aah, you two! Please wait…! 
…They left. I guess I might as well leave too. 
Kanna! You shouldn't say things like that! 
…Oh, yeah? 
Indeed! I won't be spoken to this way by some sub-amoeba life form!. 
A-Amoeba…? 
…W-Well anyway, you're going after Sumire too hard! 
…Whatever! 
She left. 
I wonder… if I said too much? 
It's just the right dosage for someone like her. 
…
So, you aren't denying it… I get it. 
You make it sound as though we’ve been caught. 
Apologize to Ensign and I! If you do it right away, I'll forgive you! 
This isn't a joke! Why should I… 
Stop it, both of you! Now’s not the time to be arguing! 
…I will not forget this. 
Yeah, same here! 
Well then, Captain, please be careful. 
Thanks. Take care of things while I'm gone. 
Understood. All right, Sakura, please stay in the War Room. 
Understood. 
Mon Frère, good luck! I'll be taking a nap. 
I'll be in the hangar servicing the Koubu. Chief, if you get a sec, could you stop by? 
I want your opinion on the maintenance policy. Later, gator! 
…Right. Sumire, Kanna, let's meet at the first floor entrance. 
Got it. Aah, if only a certain someone wasn't coming, this mission would be awesome. 
I agree entirely. Were I alone with Ensign, this would be an amazing, pleasant assignment. 
Pfft. I'm going ahead, Boss. 
I am going as well. I hate to be kept waiting, so please come quickly. 
Jeez. Are those two going to be OK…? 
A-Ayame… 
Uh, well… actually… 
Sumire and Kanna… <br> The Hive’s objective… 
I'm concerned about what's going on between Sumire and Kanna. Can they truly perform their duties in this state? 
T-That's true, but… is it even possible for me to get them to make up? 
Ah… Of course. So that’s what’s going on here? 
What exactly is the Hive of Darkness planning? 
Y-Yes. Forgive me. 
…
R-Right. I'm sorry, I don't know what's wrong with me. 
Thank you, I’m feeling much better! 
Who am I kidding… This is still terrible. 
Is Ayame around? 
I guess I'll try somewhere else. 
Oh, Ogami. What's wrong? You haven't left for Fukagawa yet? 
Uh, no. 
That's not good. This is an important mission. You need to pull yourself together. 
Uh, of course… my apologies. 
Look after those two, Ogami. 
Ah, Ogami. Didn't you leave already? 
Well… I thought that I would talk with you before leaving… 
Haha, I'm glad I can be of service but… it's also important that you think independently, right? 
Anyway, you said you wanted to talk to me… What about? 
Well… it's about the last battle. 
Oh… What exactly do you want to ask, Ogami? 
Situation Report <br> Member Report <br> It's nothing. 
I'd like to hear about how our last battle impacted the surrounding area. 
The damage to the Asakusa area was kept to a minimum. You did well. Ogami. 
You did particularly well during the battle in the city, your quick response was excellent. 
You figured out the enemy's plan, made a decision and acted. This is crucial on the battlefield. 
Try your best with what you have, Ogami. 
Unfortunately, you weren't able to respond quickly enough, and the surrounding area took a lot of damage. 
The damage was far reaching… the Sanja Festival will most likely be postponed. 
Ahh, and a bundle of petitions were sent by a kimono shop. 
Your enemy's actions, the movement of your troops… Being able to quickly assess these factors is very important. 
…You can do it, Captain. 
I'd like to hear about the troops' fighting style in our last battle. 
Ogami… 
The Assault Troupe only has seven members. Even lacking one member is a huge loss, don't you agree? 
Though we should be grateful their life was spared. 
Sakura certainly isn’t weak, but she also isn’t the strongest. She needs proper support when sent out. 
Sumire has excellent combat capabilities, but you mustn't overestimate her. She needs proper support. 
Maria's defenses are weak, so you should avoid placing her in close-quarters combat situations. 
Kanna has the strength to fight in close-quarters combat. She's cut out for the front lines. 
Iris was angry. She still can't fight by herself, so we have to protect her… 
Kohran's attack power is weak, but she has a wide range. Take that into consideration when giving her orders. 
As the captain, you must provide sufficient support. You are what strengthens the bonds of the unit. 
We took quite a lot of damage… You need to provide better support or your comrades will lose their faith in you 
There were far too many casualties. Ogami… you're a failure as a leader!
The damage to the Assault Troupe was minimal. You did well, Ogami. 
You cared for those in your command and your judgment was spot-on. 
Also… let's see. You shouldn't view these numbers as a complete reflection of the battle's outcome, but… 
The number of enemies destroyed should be used as one rubric to evaluate your troops. 
The one that destroyed the most enemies during the last battle was Sakura. 
Sakura's technique shines when the enemies line up facing the same direction. 
Guide her well. You should predict where the enemy will move, and order Sakura accordingly. 
The one that destroyed the most enemies during the last battle was Sumire. 
Sumire's technique is especially powerful when she is surrounded by enemies. 
However, that doesn't mean you should send her off alone. 
The one that destroyed the most enemies during the last battle was Maria. 
Maria is perfect for the rear guard. She excels when she's firing over the shoulders of the front line. 
With her skills, you can trust that she'll never accidentally hit an ally. 
The one that destroyed the most enemies during the last battle was Kanna. 
Kanna has powerful attacks, so she can fight at the front line, but her abilities are wasted in the rear guard. 
The one that destroyed the most enemies during the last battle was Iris. 
Since she is able to move around the battlefield freely, she might be best suited for supporting the others. 
The one that destroyed the most enemies during the last battle was Kohran. 
Kohran's bombs have a large explosion radius, so you should aim her attacks where enemies are clustered. 
Her performance was truly inspiring. 
Take this as proof of her trust in you as a commanding officer, Ogami. 
You think so…? Well, thank you, ma'am. 
I suppose that summarizes the situation regarding the last battle… Is there anything else? 
No, thank you, ma'am. 
Oh, but… Ogami. About the upcoming mission… 
…Please be careful. I’ve heard nothing but bad rumors about that abandoned mansion. 
Huh…? W-What do you mean? 
At the time of westernization, a noble family apparently hired an engineer from England to build the mansion. 
Soon, strange rumors began to spread and even after the owner left… mysterious incidents continued to occur.
For that reason, the mansion has been abandoned ever since… The inside must be in ruins. 
The floor plan won't be constructed in the Taisho style, so don't get lost. 
Understood… though I have enough to worry about with Sumire and Kanna coming along. 
Our group has many people with different origins and backgrounds living under one roof… 
Inevitably there is going to be some conflict. It is something we will always have to deal with… 
Ogami. I'm counting on you to take care of them. 
This is the door to Iris's room. 
…She might be sleeping already. I should be quiet. 
…Maybe she's still angry. It's in my best interest to keep quiet. 
Yesss! 
Ah, Mon Frère! 
Hey, Iris. Did I wake you up? 
Nope! I wasn't sleepy, so I was just sitting around. Come in! 
Ok, I'll come in just for a little bit. 
Hey, hey, Mon Frère. I can't sleep… Tell me a story. 
A story? Hmm… 
"The Monkey and the Crab" <br> The Western "Cinderella" <br> "Stories of my Past" 
Great, OK, I'll tell you the story of “The Quarrel of the Monkey and the Crab!” 
Yay! I don't know that one! Hey, what's a "quarrel"? 
That's right, you were born in France, weren't you? 
A "quarrel" is like… an argument, but in this story, it means something like a battle. 
Huh… Mr. Monkey and Mr. Crab are having a battle? So, what happens? 
(Uhhh… Huh? Who appears in the story, again?) 
Bee, Chestnut, Mortar <br> Bee, Demon, Mortar <br> Sparrow, Chestnut, Mortar 
(That's right! It was a bee, a chestnut, and a mortar!) 
OK, I'll tell you the story. The tale of "The Quarrel of the Monkey and the Crab" starts now! 
Yay! Tell me! Tell me! 
Once upon a time, in a far off place… 
And then… 
However… 
And so… 
…Finally, thanks to the cooperation between the bee, the chestnut, and the mortar… 
…the crab was able to have his revenge on the monkey. And they all lived happily ever after. 
Yay! I’m so happy for Mr. Crab. 
What did you think of the story, Iris? 
Yeah! It was really interesting! Thank you, Mon Frère! 
You're welcome. OK, I'm going to get going. Sweet dreams. 
Good night Mon Frère! Be careful on your mission!   
(OK. I'm pretty sure it was a bee, a demon, and a mortar.) 
All right, I'll tell you the story. The tale of "The Quarrel of the Monkey and the Crab" starts now! 
Yay! Tell me! Tell me! 
Once upon a time, in a far off place… 
And then… 
However… 
And so… 
…Finally, the crab, monkey, bee, and mortar traveled to the island where the demon resided in his fortress. 
The crab courageously defeated the demon and returned home with the treasure. And they all lived happily ever after!
Yay! It all worked out! 
What did you think of the story, Iris? 
Yeah! It was super interesting! I was a little nervous during the fight with the demon! 
(I don't think that's exactly how the story went. It bothers me a little but… Oh well, it's fine.) 
I'm glad you liked it. OK, I'm going to get going. Sweet dreams. 
Good night Mon Frère! Be careful on your mission!  
(Let me see… I think it was a sparrow, a chestnut, and a mortar.) 
OK, I'll tell you the story. The tale of "The Quarrel of the Monkey and the Crab" starts now! 
Yay! Tell me! Tell me! 
And then… 
However… 
And so… 
…Finally, the crab chose the small wicker basket and discovered vast riches inside when he returned home. 
The monkey greedily chose the big wicker basket, however, the only thing inside was the bee which stung him. The end!
…What did you think of the story, Iris? 
Ahahahaa! That was really funny! I laughed so hard my stomach hurts! 
But I wonder… Why was there a bee inside the larger basket? 
Uh, umm… To show that greed will only disappoint you, of course. 
(I don't think that's exactly how the story went. It bothers me a little but… Oh well, it's fine.) 
OK, I'm going to get going. Sweet dreams. 
Thanks, Mon Frère! Tell me another interesting story sometime, OK? Good night! 
(Oh no, I totally forgot! Well, I guess I'll just make it up as I go!) 
OK, I'll tell you the story. The tale of "The Quarrel of the Monkey and the Crab" starts now! 
Yay! Tell me! Tell me! 
…And so the crab and monkey went head to head in an epic duel. 
The game was Rock, Paper, Scissors! The two battled until they were out of breath. Their fists were flying! But… 
…the crab defeated the monkey with “scissors!” And that is why crabs’ hands look like scissors to this day. 
And they all lived happily ever after! …I don't think that was exactly how the story went. 
Ahahahahaa! That was really funny! I laughed so hard my stomach hurts! 
I'm glad you liked it. OK, I'm going to get going. Sweet dreams. 
Thanks, Mon Frère! Tell me another interesting story sometime, OK? Good night! 
Uhh, long ago, there was a very beautiful maiden named Cinderella… 
I know that one! That's a story for little kids! 
Uh… Well, I thought you'd like it… 
Mon Frère! You're treating me like a child. Are you making fun of me again?! 
N-N-No, that's not true! It was just a little joke. A joke! 
R-Right! I better get going to Fukagawa. Well, see you, Iris! 
What?! He ran away! Now I really hate you, Mon Frère! 
OK, this is a bit more of a grown-up story, "Stories of my Past." 
OK… right. I was admitted to military school in April, when the cherry blossoms were falling… 
Zzz… 
I-Iris!? She fell asleep almost immediately… S-Somehow I feel like this is my fault. 
Oh well. I should leave the room quietly, so I don't wake her… 
…
What's wrong, Mon Frère? 
W-Well, how about I tell the story of… "The Amazing Person"? 
Yay! Tell me! Tell me! 
And then… 
However… 
And so… 
…Finally, they became a really wonderful person and lived happily ever after. What did you think, Iris? 
…That was boring. 
O-Oh… Sorry. 
W-Well, I gotta get going. Sweet dreams! 
Yeah… bye. 
Oh, Ogami. Welcome. 
Oh, Ogami. What's wrong? 
Please come again. 
Let's talk about some juicy gossip. 
All right. 
Do you need something? 
(That ribbon in her hair… it really suits her.) 
(It’s a charming look on someone as mature as Kasumi.) 
(Not a hair out of place.) 
(She really does have beautiful hair… She must spend a lot of time getting ready every day.) 
(Kasumi has a very calm expression…) 
(She looks gentle, but I bet she's scary if you make her angry… She's kind of the reliable older sister type.) 
…Is something the matter, Ogami? 
Oh, no, it's nothing, Kasumi. 
(There's a quiet, calm look in her eyes.) 
(Kasumi always looks people right in the eyes when she talks to them.) 
(Those traditional Japanese clothes look great on her.) 
(Her demeanor is so calm, but her movements have no openings I can see… I wonder if she has experience with martial arts.) 
(Gotta love the chest areas on traditional Japanese clothes…) 
…
(She's actually got quite a…) 
Ogami! This is really inappropriate…
Oh, sorry… 
I wonder if the show can continue like this until next month. What a mess. 
Ogami, couldn't you get Kanna and Sumire to make up somehow? 
That’s easy enough to say, but… hmm… it's gonna be tough… 
Please, Ogami. You're our only hope. 
I hope they don't keep up their fighting in Fukagawa… I'm worried. 
Ogami, I'm sure it'll be a challenge, but try your best. 
Do you need me for anything? 
(She's got her scarf pinned with a brooch.) 
(I wonder what it's made of… Couldn't be a real jewel, right?) 
…Are you interested in this brooch? Oh, hey, listen to this. I actually got it super cheap at a bargain sale. 
…
(The way Yuri's hair curls away from her face is so charming…) 
(That bouncy look is pretty trendy.) 
Is something odd about my hair? Oh nooo, I've got some split ends! 
(Her face is small and balanced. I think even a model would be jealous.) 
(It doesn't seem like she uses a lot of make-up. Well, she's got a nice foundation, I don't think she needs it…) 
What's wrong, Ogami? You've been staring at my face for a while. Haha, you're in love with me, aren't you! 
Hey now… You shouldn't tease adults! 
Hehehe… Sorry, Ogami. 
(Her eyes are shining with curiosity.) 
(Yumi's got a reputation for loving juicy gossip…) 
Hey, Ogami. Have you heard any good rumors lately? 
(Her clothes are pretty colorful.) 
(Maybe she's going for that popular bus guide look?) 
Something the matter, Ogami? 
No I was just thinking… your outfit is pretty cute. 
Oh, you noticed? I'm glad you like it! I actually coordinated this outfit myself. 
Is that so? 
(Goodness… that's certainly an aggressive neckline…) 
(But… isn't this supposed to be a uniform?) 
Ahaha, Ogami. I see you've been stricken by my allure! 
…Whoa, whoa! (You aren't Sumire, you know.) 
Fukagawa…? That's going to be something… there are a lot of awful rumors surrounding that mansion. 
You know, in Fukagawa there's a lovely view from the hill… 
But now that place has an eerie atmosphere. Something spooky is bound to happen… 
Ogami, Kanna isn't always calm, so keep a close eye on her, OK? 
If she gets sulky even once, it'll be a disaster! 
Ogami, if you care for Kanna, don't leave her side! 
Ogami! First it was Iris, and now word is you're going on a date with Sumire. 
How did that rumor get started?! 
Alone inside an abandoned mansion… just the two of you searching… It's just the right mood! 
…Really? It just sounds creepy to me… 
Sumire is strong and independent, but I’m sure she must want someone by her side. 
I haven’t heard good things about that Fukagawa mansion… 
What have you heard…? 
Strange figures seen around the mansion, horrible moaning coming from the building night after night. Stuff like that.
Hey, hey… don't frighten me… 
Sakura is very popular with both children and adults. 
Sumire often receives flowers from young members of the nobility. 
Maria's popular among men AND women. Her performances are just that good. 
It's pretty easy to see why Iris is so popular, though mostly just among our more elderly guests. 
Honestly… I really don't get where Kohran's popularity comes from… 
Kanna's super popular among the kids. 
That's right, Iris has been sleeping a lot lately. She said she’s going to take a nap today as Well… 
Hmmm… She is? 
I wonder if something's wrong…? 
Things are busy even though it's summer, right, Ogami? 
Same to you. Isn't it hard for you having so many more customers than usual? 
Yes. Kanna in particular is very popular with the children. 
Kanna's pictures fly off the shelves. 
It's quite busy, but when I see all the children, I don't mind at all. 
You really like your job, don't you, Tsubaki? 
Of course. But I have to keep at it. 
Welcome, Ogami! Is there something you need? 
(A shopkeeper's outfit. Tsubaki looks good in it.) 
H-Hey, Ogami! Where do you think you're looking? Stop! 
Ogami… come on, don't stare at me like that. It's embarrassing. 
Thanks for your business! Come again! 
Is there something on my face? 
Chief, thanks for your help with the Koubu! Those upgrades will be ready lickety-split. Look forward to it! 
(I don't want to get in the way. I guess I'll leave the hangar for now.) 
Chief, you're just in time. I want your opinion on the Koubu maintenance… 
What's this? Leaving without hardly saying a word? Bit rude, doncha think? 
If you’re not even gonna listen to me, then why are you still here goggling at everything? 
If it's something I can help with then please let me know. 
OK, well, I do have something I want to ask. 
Right now I'm servicing the Koubu, and giving them an update while I’m at it! 
What? That's amazing!! 
So, I want you to decide whether I should focus on their offensive or defensive abilities. 
In that case, I'll happily share my opinion! 
Well, considering our budget, my updates will only improve the Koubu slightly…
Anyway, let's get started. 
Do you want to make your own Koubu more offensive or defensive? 
Ramp up the offenses! <br> Beef up the defenses! 
Offense is the best defense, right? That choice is very in-character for you, Chief. 
OK, next is Maria's Koubu. Which will you choose? 
All right. I'm making the armor lighter so I think that should increase the evasion rate a little. 
OK, next is Maria's Koubu. Which will you choose? 
Let's go with offensive. <br> Make it defensive. 
Got it. Maria's Koubu will be offensive. 
Next is Sakura's Koubu. Which will you choose, Chief? 
Got it. Maria's Koubu will be defensive. 
Next is Sakura's Koubu. Which will you choose, Chief? 
Let's make it offensive. <br> Defensive would be best. 
OK, you want Sakura's Koubu to be offensive. It's exactly as I thought. 
Next is Sumire's Koubu. Which one? 
Oh, you want Sakura's Koubu to be defensive? That could be very interesting. 
Next is Sumire's Koubu. Which one? 
Offensive, I suppose. <br> How about defensive? 
Of course. Sumire's will be offensive. 
Next is Kanna's. What do you think? 
Of course. Sumire's will be defensive. 
Next is Kanna's. What do you think? 
Offensive. <br> How about defensive? 
You're going to make Kanna's Koubu offensive then? 
What will you do with Iris's Koubu that just entered battle not long ago? 
Defensive, huh…? That might actually work pretty well. 
What will you do with Iris's Koubu? Its first battle was not that long ago. 
Let's make it offensive. <br> How about defensive? 
Seems as though Iris is going to be a great asset in battle, so I think that's a good choice. 
Finally, which do you want my Koubu to be? I think I should make it offensive… 
That sounds good to me. <br> Yours should be defensive. 
Exactly! If you don't attack then you can't win, right? 
All right, my Koubu will be offensive. 
No, when I think about your style, Kohran, I think that yours should be defensive. 
Hmm… My "style," huh? Sure… 
…
Understood. I'll do as you say and make my Koubu defensive! 
Now, it's just a matter of budget. If we don’t have enough funds, even simple improvements won't be doable. 
Uhh, so… Add the cost of materials… Hmm… Multiplied by six… and the overall expense is… 
…Chief, what's 1,250 plus 970?
…Is it 2,120? <br> Uh… 2,200. <br> No, 2,320. 
…Correct! Chief, you're so smart. You got it right away! 
Uh, no, I mean… Hahahaha. 
…Looks like it’s 2,220. What's wrong, Chief? You were taking forever. 
C-Crap! I was so close… 
Really? Uhhh… Wait! You're wrong, Chief! 
S-Sorry… 
No, no, that's all right. Everyone makes mistakes! 
…Somehow I think I'll be able to stay within our budget. OK, let's do it! 
I'm sorry for keeping you for so long, but you were a great help. 
No problem, I'm looking forward to our updated Koubu. Good luck. 
Thanks. Be careful on your mission. Catch you later. 
…Captain. When exactly were you going to Fukagawa? 
Huh? Uh… I was just going r-right now! Haha, see you!! 
(Huh… It looks like Maria and Sakura are talking.) 
Captain, weren't you supposed to go to Fukagawa? 
Yes, I was just going to leave. By the way… what are you two doing? 
We were discussing Iris's fighting style on the battlefield. 
Iris is still in the early days of her battling career. 
We were wondering if we can help her ease into it somehow. 
You don't seem to be in any hurry, Captain. Would you like to join the discussion? 
All right, I'm going then… Sorry for interrupting you. 
Goodbye! 
Good luck with Sumire and Kanna. 
Iris is able to move through walls by teleporting. 
Yeah… 
If she gets separated from everyone in a dangerous situation, make sure she retreats to a safe location. 
You know what they say, "one pair of heels is often worth two pairs of hands." 
Wait, I know where that’s from… 
Ancient China? <br> Shingen Takeda? <br> Napoleon? 
That's an ancient Chinese war strategy, isn't it? 
Really, is it? 
That's just like you, Captain. You are very well-read. 
…What does that mean again? 
Captain… "One pair of heels is often worth two pairs of hands"… 
It's an ancient Chinese war tactic. It means… there is no better safety measure than running away. 
What, really? 
I hadn't realized… 
What, really? 
No! 
It’s an ancient Chinese war tactic. It means… there is no better safety measure than running away. 
Really?! That's what it means? 
…
Iris still doesn't have much experience with battle. 
You must protect her well, Captain. 
Please, Ogami. 
Shouldn't you be going to the Fukagawa mansion? 
Now that I think of it, Kohran should be servicing the Koubu in the underground hangar. 
Before you leave, why don't go have a look? 
Ogami, if you use Iris's special move, you can undo the damage done to your Koubu. 
In fact, you can heal everyone within a certain area. It's very helpful. 
She’s a reliable ally. <br> Doing well, for a child. <br> We have to protect her. 
It seems we've gained a reliable ally. 
Absolutely. Iris is sure to be a powerful member of the Flower Division.
I'll have to make sure I don't fall behind! 
She's doing so well, even though she's still a child. 
That's true. When I was ten, all I did was play outside in the fields and mountains… 
When I think about it… I feel a little bad for her. 
Sakura, I don’t think you need to worry. Iris is much more of an adult than you give her credit for. 
And Captain, I advise against treating Iris too much like a child, lest we have a repeat of the incident from July. 
Y-Yes, you're right. 
But we can't push her too hard. We have to protect her. 
Yes… Unfortunately, on the battlefield, we still have to treat her with kid gloves. 
Right, protecting Iris from danger will be one of my most important jobs during combat. 
I’ll have to take special care of her. 
Wow… isn’t Iris lucky to have you protecting her. 
…
Is something wrong, Ogami? 
Well, Iris is a valuable asset to our team but… her power is still unstable. 
Are you worried that she may fly into another rampage like before?
Yes… 
Captain, we must believe in Iris. Now is when she will experience the most growth. 
That's right, Ogami. 
…Yes, that's true. 
Anyway, we’re going to continue discussing the best battle tactics for Iris. 
Right. Good luck. 
Thanks! 
I wonder if the manager is around. 
I guess I'll try somewhere else. 
Zzz… zZz… Zzz… 
He’s certainly sawing some logs in there. 
Still not on your way? If you don't hurry, the sun will set! 
Yes, about that…so we’re really going without Koubu…? 
Yes, but take heart. Even if the Koubu were available, you wouldn't take them on this mission. 
What? 
Were you planning on searching the mansion in a huge Koubu? This is a preemptive investigation, you know. 
And what's more, we don't have definite information about whether the enemy is actually there or not. 
Besides, we can't enter private premises. 
W-We can't? 
Well, don't look so serious about it! If it gets bad, just run away! 
Right… 
Even if you get caught, protect Sumire and Kanna with everything you have! Got it? 
Absolutely… 
Hey, sorry. Were you waiting long? 
No, it's all right. It's just like you to be right on time, Ensign. 
All right, let's go! 
Someone's enthusiastic! You know we're not going on a picnic, right? 
What's that?
Hey, be nice to each other. 
All right, we're headed to the Fukagawa mansion. Our objective is to scout the area and investigate. 
And please, knock it off with the loud arguments. 
Hmph! 
Siiiigh, I can’t say I’m excited for this. 
I'm so sorry. Were you waiting long? Are you angry…? You definitely look angry. 
Of course I'm angry! I told you that I hate to be kept waiting! 
Honestly… what in heaven’s name were you up to anyway? 
Ah, quit makin’ such a fuss! It's fine if he's late just a little bit! 
Punctuality is the politeness of princes. I only ask that the Ensign keep to the scheduled time. 
Well, it's doubtful whether an insensitive woman such as you has any sense of time at all. 
What did you say?! 
Hold on, I was the one who was late. Please stop fighting. 
All right, we're heading for the mansion. Our objective is to scout and investigate. So knock off all the fighting. 
Hmph! 
Siiiigh, I can’t say I’m excited for this. 
(Jeez… It's like last time…)

But isn't it the job of the captain to resolve trouble amongst the troops? 
Don't you think the commander assigned those members to you because he expects you to resolve their issue? 
Even I don't know what the enemy plans to do once they have cast a spell on the capital. 
Isn't it your responsibility to find that out, Ogami? 
Ogami… I understand how hard it is with Sumire and Kanna, and the Hive of Darkness. 
But you can't let your doubts show on your face. It makes everyone anxious.
