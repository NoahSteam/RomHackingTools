﻿It's a photo of Sakura. She's looking right at me. I wonder what she's thinking...
It's a photo of Sumire. This is a side of her you don't see too often.
It's a photo of Maria. ...She's lost in thought and looks kind of sad...
A photo of Kanna. She looks strong and reliable. I can't wait to meet her.
A photo of Iris. She's surrounded by flowers and flashing a radiant smile.
A photo of Kohran. She's looking pretty in profile with her face dyed red by the evening sun.
A letter given to me by a customer. I was asked to give it to Sumire. I have a bad feeling about this...
Maria's pistol. This may help me escape from here...
A hair ornament. It's decorated with flowers and looks very elegant.
A pretty pendant. The delicate workmanship is gorgeous.
A hairpin for use in a traditional bun hairstyle. It would complement a formal outfit well.
This key will let me enter rooms I couldn't before.
I found this in a bedroom on the second floor. I can use it to access the back room.
A teacup Iris asked me to get for her. It has a very stylish design.
This is the matchbox Iris asked for. Its logo is quite colorful.
A knife Iris asked me to get for her. Just a normal utensil you'd use during a meal.
A prop sword and shield used onstage. They're well-made and look just like the real thing.
A prop crown used onstage. It's well constructed and incredibly detailed.
A wig and costume used onstage. I wonder what kind of act could use a flashy outfit like this?
A photo of Sakura in her swimsuit. Wow, this is really something. I'm gonna treasure this.
A photo of Sumire in her stage costume. Her distinctive makeup really makes an impact.
It's a photo of Maria on stage in the military uniform from "For Love"... She's a beautiful woman disguised as a man.
A photo of Kanna in her training gear. Catching her in a private moment like this feels surprisingly intimate.
A photo of Iris in her swimsuit. She's holding a rubber ring and looks ready to have some fun. How cute.
A photo of Kohran. I don't get to see her with her braids undone very often. It's a nice look.
A photo of Ayame in a traditional outfit. I hope she'll always be as happy and content as she is here.
Ayame's gun. Why...? Why did it have to turn out like this...?
Jean-Paul the teddy bear. Iris's best friend. She always carries him with her and takes good care of him.
If you bundle three of them together, they don't get in your way when you're working. It's very convenient. 
(When you look from this angle…you can really tell she has a chest…) 
…Chief. What have you been looking at this whole time?
Uh, well, I…was thinking that work must be tough… 
Is that the line you use when you're looking at somebody's chest? 
(She's going to get mad at me again…I should stop staring at her.) 
Some oil has splattered on your clothes here and there. 
Staring at people's clothes like that… Are you possessed or something? 
Kohran, don't you have work clothes? 
Don't worry! This battle garb is really tough. 
Yeah… 
Everything's built-in from comms to knives. Resists fire, water, and, of course, oil and electricity too! 
Wow, that's amazing! 
Stubborn dirt comes off with just a wipe. Seriously, it's excellent clothing! 
You're sweating a little. 
The koubu also go into battle… I have to service them properly. 
Your expression is so lively. You really love machines, don't you? 
Maybe it's because you've been tinkering with the machines you like so much, but your eyes have so much energy. 
What's gotten into you? Starting into people's eyes… 
Looking at your eyes when you're working on machines, I was thinking how they really light up… 
Stop it, Chief! I'm embarrassed, seriously…But, I'm happy too. 
When I have a moment, I want to read this book. 
However, this is not the time for reading. Let's head to the entrance. 
There's no point in returning to the room. Sumire and Kanna should be waiting at the entrance. 
Sakura should be in the Operations Room. 
I'd better hurry to the entrance too. 
It looks like no one is here. They must still be in the Operations Room. 
Kanna should already be at the entrance. 
I'd better hurry to the entrance too. 
Kanna, are you here…? It doesn't look like it. 
Maria should be in the Operations Room. 
I need to hurry up and join Sumire and Kanna at the entrance. 
…It doesn't look like anyone is here. 
The voices coming from the Operations Room sound passionate. 
Kohran is in the underground hangar. 
I need to hurry up and join Sumire and Kanna at the entrance. 
She's not here. Kohran must still be in the hangar. 
Sumire is definitely at the entrance already. 
Sumire is waiting. I'd better get to the entrance. 
…Doesn't look like anyone is here after all. 
At a time like this, no one should be dawdling. 
I'd better get to the entrance too. 
Ahh, you'd definitely get sunburned being here. 
If I don't hurry up and get to the entrance, they're going to complain. 
I knew it…But, I guess this is what happens after a performance ends. 
I'd better hurry to the entrance. 
The summer sunlight is coming in strong through the window. 
I'd better hurry to the entrance. 
Since I've been at the Imperial Theater, it seems like this room has barely been used. 
I'd better hurry to the entrance. 
When a performance ends, it becomes lonely in here. 
…Anyway, I wonder if those two are already at the entrance. 
This place is usually very lively, but now no one is here. 
I'd better hurry to the entrance. 
I was just about to say that this room also gets quiet when there isn't a performance. 
…Let's go! Sumire and Kanna are waiting at the entrance. 
No matter when I come here, this is somehow a gloomy place. 
I'd better get to the first-floor entrance. 
Kanna doesn't really come through here, does she…I guess not. 
I'd better get to the entrance. 
Before I go to Fukagawa I should eat and…Huh? I felt like Kanna was there for a moment. 
…Ahh, this is bad! If I don't hurry and get to the entrance, they're going to complain. 
I'm pretty sure the meeting place was the outside of the entrance. 
This area is very lonely without patrons too. 
…Anyway, I wonder if those two are already at the entrance. 
The performance is over and the wings are completely silent. 
…I'd better get to the entrance. 
Looks like nobody is here. 
…I'd better get to the entrance. 
Even in the afternoon this storage room is pretty dark… 
…I'd better get to the entrance. 
Looks like nobody is here. 
Let's go! Sumire and Kanna are waiting at the entrance. If we're late… 
Hmm…Now that it's summer, I want to swim here as much as I can… 
However, if I don't hurry to the entrance, they're going to really complain. 
The air feels cool. Even in the summer, the basement is a pretty cold place. 
…Let's go! Sumire and Kanna are waiting at the entrance. 
Nobody here. 
However, if I don't hurry to the entrance, they're going to really complain. 
Nobody here. 
All right, let's hurry to where Sumire and Kanna are! 
I can faintly hear the sounds from the boiler room. 
I'd better hurry up and get to the entrance. 
The alarm isn't ringing so it only follows that nobody would be here right now. 
Next door in the Operations Room, Sakura and Maria are talking. 
Better get to the entrance. 
Nobody here. 
Better get to the entrance. 
Oh, are you done? 
Oh, are you done?

Most of the guys buying Iris's photo are older gentlemen. 
They always glance around nervously when they buy it. I wonder if they're worried what people will think? 
You'd like to buy this photo? Thank you! 
That's a photo of Kohran. That'll be 50 zeni. 
We need to leave some for the guests, so just take one for now, okay?

You'd like to buy that? Thank you! 
Hmm… Kohran's fanbase is a bit of a mystery. 
I'm here! 
Ensign Ogami, thank you for coming. 
Lieutenant General Yoneda has some news for you. Pay attention, Ogami. 
In Fukagawa, there is a former noble's mansion. It's mostly unoccupied and has become abandoned. 
Apparently, the Hive of Darkness is using it somehow. 
You mean the Fukagawa mansion? What would the Hive of Darkness want with that place? 
…I don't know. However, I have one theory as to their motives. 
And that is…sorcery. 
Did you say…sorcery? <br> Why investigate Fukagawa? <br> What's their motive? 
Why investigate Fukagawa? <br> What's their motive? 
What's their motive? 
Why investigate Fukagawa? 
Did you say…sorcery? <br> What's their motive? 
What's their motive? 
Did you say…sorcery? 
Did you say…sorcery? <br> Why investigate Fukagawa? 
Why investigate Fukagawa? 
Did you say…sorcery? 
Sorcery…? As in paper fortunes and Yin and Yang? This is the Taisho era… 
Sorcery is not simply old-fashioned thinking, Ogami. 
Natural explanations for things beyond science… sorcery. The ancient power that underlies all history… 
Could it be that the Hive of Darkness is planning to put a spell on Tokyo? 
On the capital itself… 
Why investigate Fukagawa? 
We've gotten a report from the townspeople. The other night, a suspicious group was seen around the abandoned mansion. 
We've confirmed that something like a Hex Mech was also present. The odds that it's the Hive are very high. 
But why Fukagawa…? 
Until now, every location where the Hive of Darkness has appeared has been one of Tokyo's spiritual places. 
Fukagawa may be an industrial zone now, but it was once a famous sacred place with shrines and temples. 
It may seem unremarkable to us, but there must be something there they want. 
What exactly is their motive? 
What their motive is…I honestly don't know. 
C-Commander?! 
Wait a minute, Ogami. I can make a guess. 
The Hive of Darkness is an organization aiming for the reinstatement of the Shogunate and the destruction of Tokyo. 
Consequently, attacking specific spots in the capital might hold some kind of deep meaning. 
We don't have enough information. This is the perfect opportunity to look into our enemy's movements. 
Absolutely… 
Spying is not technically the responsibility of the Flower Troupe but… 
Right now is a good chance to grasp the Hive of Darkness' plans. 
It is necessary for us to understand the enemy's plan when we go on the offensive as well. 
Of course. That's why we must investigate Fukagawa's mansion. 
We can't use the Koubu this time because Kohran is servicing them and making adjustments. 
Our mission is to spy and investigate. Don't do anything extreme. 
Commander, who is being sent to Fukagawa? 
Hm. This time the spy team will consist of Ogami, Sumire, and Kanna. We'll limit it to three. 
What?! 
Me…and Sumire?! 
Sumire and Kanna?! <br> Understood! <br> I'd prefer Sakura though… 
Sumire and Kanna?! <br> Understood! <br> I'd prefer Maria though… 
Sumire and Kanna?! <br> Understood! <br> I'd prefer Iris though… 
Sumire and Kanna?! <br> Understood! <br> I'd prefer Kohran though… 
What! Sumire and Kanna?! But, why?! 
Maria and Sakura are researching new battle tactics, Kohran is servicing the Koubu… 
Besides Sumire and Kanna, my hands are tied. 
And I-Iris? 
Hm… Iris is… 
Iris is...? 
It's her nap time. 
I'm so tiiired! 
Nap time?! 
…Also, at the moment, you three are the easiest members to move. 
Understood! Myself, Sumire Kanzaki, Kanna Kirishima, together the three of us will head to Fukagawa Mansion. 
Yes, excellent. Good luck, Ogami. 
Ogami! Not feeling very motivated, are we? 
Y-yes, of yourse! 
This isn't the time to dawdle. Honestly! 
I-I apologize. 
Commander Yoneda… Um…Why couldn't we take Sakura? 
If I have to take anyone, I think Sakura would be the best choice… 
Commander Yoneda… Um…Why couldn't we take Maria? 
If I have to take anyone, I think Maria would be the best choice… 
Commander Yoneda… Um…Why couldn't we take Iris? 
If I have to take anyone, I think Iris would be the best choice… 
Commander Yoneda… Um…Why couldn't we take Kohran? 
If I have to take anyone, I think Kohran would be the best choice… 
…… 
Is that impossible? 
Ogami… I've thought about it a lot. Please trust my judgment. 
Ogami… I'm asking you as well. 
Please take Sumire and Kanna with you to Fukagawa. 
Oh… of course. 
…Well then. Get going, you three! 
Right! 
I'm not on board with it but… I concur. 
…… 
Kanna!! 
…Fine. We can't help an order. Let's go together. 
What's this? If you're going to go all annoyed like that you could always just refuse, you know. 
Shut up! You shut your mouth! 
(Man… Are the three of us going to be okay?) 
Oh, Ensign? 
Waaa!! S-Sumire. 
(Well, this isn't good. This is worse than that time with Kanna…) 
Huh… That massive object behind you. Could it be… 
What the hell! Are you looking for a fight?! 
Sumire, could you please cut it out! Hey, Kanna, you calm down too… 
Hmm. You two seem veeery close, don't you… 
You're misunderstanding this! <br> You see… to tell the truth… <br> It's not like that! 
Sumire, this is a misunderstanding! 
Oh, a misunderstanding? Which part am I misunderstanding? 
I only spoke to Kanna as her commanding officer. 
It's not relevant whether we get along or not. 
Oh, I see. As a commanding officer, you sympathized with poor Kanna. 
…! 
No, Sumire. It's not that I felt bad for her… 
Sir…I'm going to go ahead. See you. 
Aww, poor Kanna. I also sympathize with you. 
"Shut up! Just leave it, or you're lookin' to get smacked!" 
Waaa, I'm scared! Ogami, help meee. 
Tch…! 
Uh, wait, Kanna! 
(Not good… This level of animosity can't just be laughed off.) 
(There are only seven members of the Flower Troupe. We need value teamwork…) 
…Ensign. Shall we head to the Operations Room? 
Uh, yeah. Let's go. 
No, Sumire! It's doesn't mean anything… 
It doesn't? What reason do you have to be with Kanna, then? 
Uh, well… 
…What is this, Ensign? You invited me so there must be a reason! 
N-no, actually… 
…I should have known! You aren't a very forthcoming person, you know. I take my leave. 
…Sir. I'm going ahead… 
Aah, you two! Please wait…! 
…They left. I guess I might as well leave too. 
Sumire! You shouldn't say that! 
Hmm, oh, really? 
To talk to people as if they were objects is really terrible! 
And more than that, how can you draw conclusions from nothing more than "They were walking together"? 
Oh, I think I see. I have been truly appalling. Forgive me! 
I wonder if I said too much. 
I think it was just right for that princess. 
I wonder… 
…No one is going to refute it. Of course. 
I don't like…your tone. 
Even though Ensign isn't covering himself very well, you shouldn't talk to him like that! Apologize! 
I don't want to hear that I should apologize. Especially, from you! 
Stop, both of you! Now is not the time for quarreling! 
…Don't forget it! 
I could say the same thing to you! 
Uh, Ensign! 
Huh…! K-Kanna!! 
(Jeez, this is bad. Even worse than that time with Sumire…) 
Huh!? What are the captain and this awful woman doing together? 
Hmm… I see. The two of them are taking a cozy walk together. Whatever. 
This is a misunderstanding! <br> It doesn't mean… <br> Don't say it that way! 
Kanna, this is a misunderstanding! 
Oh, a misunderstanding! Which part!? 
I only reached out to Sumire as captain. 
It's not relevant whether we get along or not. 
Hmmm, I see. As captain, you were only feeling sorry for Sumire. 
…! 
Uh, no, Kanna. I didn't necessarily feel bad for her… 
Captain…I'm taking my leave to go ahead. 
Oh ho ho. It looks like I've usurped him. Sorry. 
…… 
Ah, Sumire…I guess she left. 
(Not good… This level of animosity can't just be laughed off.) 
(There are only seven members of the Flower Troupe. We need to value teamwork…) 
…What do you want to do, Captain? We should get going. 
…Yes. 
No, Kanna! This isn't what it… 
It isn't? Then why were you with that awful woman? 
Uh, well… 
…What is going on, Ensign! You invited me so you must have had a reason!? 
N-no, actually… 
…Seriously! I can't stand to be with you anymore! I'm going ahead!? 
…Ensign. I will also go ahead… 
Aah, you two! Please wait…! 
…They left. I guess I might as well leave too. 
Kanna! You shouldn't say things like that! 
…Oh, yeah? 
That's right! I don't want to hear it from a creature even lower than an amoeba. 
A-amoeba…? 
…W-well anyway, you're going after Sumire too hard! 
…Whatever! 
She left. 
I wonder… if I said too much? 
It's perfect medicine for that person. 
…… 
So, you aren't denying it… I get it. 
You're baiting him… Saying it like that. 
Apologize to me and Ensign! If you do it now I'll forgive you! 
This isn't a joke! Why should I… 
Stop it, both of you! This isn't the time to be arguing! 
…You had better remember it. 
I could say the same thing to you! 
Well then, Captain, please be careful. 
Thanks. Take care of things while I'm gone. 
Understood. Well then, Sakura, please stay in the Operations Room. 
Understood. 
Mon Frère, good luck! I'll be taking a nap. 
I'll be in the hangar servicing the Koubu. Chief, if it's all right, could you stop by sometime? 
I want your opinion on the maintenance policy. See you. 
…Right. Sumire, Kanna, let's meet at the first floor entrance. 
Got it. Aaah, if only a certain someone wasn't coming, this would be the best. 
I agree entirely. If I was alone with the Ensign, this would be an amazing, pleasant assignment. 
Pfft. I'm going ahead, boss. 
I am going as well. I hate to be kept waiting, so please come quickly. 
Jeez. Are those two going to be ok…? 
A-Ayame… 
Uh… well… actually… 
Sumire and Kanna… <br> The Hive’s objective… 
I'm concerned about what's going on between Sumire and Kanna… In this state, can they truly do their duty? 
T-that's right but… I wonder if I can get them to make up? 
Ah… of course… Is that what it is? 
What exactly is the Hive of Darkness planning? 
Y-yes. Forgive me. 
…… 
R-right. I'm sorry, I don't know what's wrong with me. 
Thank you, I’m feeling much better! 
Who am I kidding… This is still terrible. 
Is Ayame around? 
I guess I'll try somewhere else. 
Oh, Ogami. What's wrong? You haven't left for Fukagawa yet? 
Uh, no. 
That's not good. This is an important mission. You need to pull yourself together. 
Uh, of course… My apologies. 
Look after those two, Ogami. 
Ah, Ogami. Didn't you leave already? 
Well… I thought that I would talk with you before leaving… 
Haha, I'm glad I can be of service but… it's also important that you think independently, right? 
Anyway, you said you wanted to talk to me… what about? 
Well… It's about the last battle. 
Oh… what exactly you want to ask, Ogami? 
Situation Report <br> Member Report <br> It's nothing. 
I'd like to hear about how our last battle impacted the surrounding area. 
The damage to the Asakusa area has been kept to a minimum. You did well. Ogami. 
You did particularly well during the battle in the city, your quick response was excellent. 
You realized what the enemy's plan, made a decision, and acted. This is crucial on the battlefield. 
Try your best with what you have, Ogami. 
Unfortunately… you weren't about to respond quickly enough, and the surrounding area took a lot of damage. 
The damage has spread… It seems that the Sanja Festival will be postponed. 
Ahh… and a bundle of petitions has been delivered from the fabric shop. 
Your enemy's actions, the movement of your troops - being able to quickly assess factors is very important. 
…You can do it, Captain. 
I'd like to hear about the troops' fighting style in our last battle. 
Ogami… 
In the 7-person Flower Troupe, even lacking one member is an extraordinarily large loss, don't you agree? 
Though we should be grateful their life was spared. 
Sakura's skills are by no means lacking, nor excellent. She shouldn't be sent without proper support. 
Sumire has excellent combat capabilities, but you mustn't overestimate her. She needs proper support. 
Maria's defenses are weak, so you should avoid placing her in close-quarters combat situations. 
Kanna has the strength to fight in close-quarters combat. She's cut out to be an advance guard. 
Iris was angry. She still can't fight by herself, so we have to protect her… 
Kohran's attack skills are weak, but she can do range attacks. Make sure you understand that, Ogami. 
As the captain, you must provide sufficient support. You are what strengthens the bonds of the unit. 
We took quite a lot of damage… You need to provide better support, or they'll lose their faith in you. 
The damage was vast. If you continue with this style of battle… Ogami, you aren’t fit to be captain! 
The damage to the Flower Troupe was minimal. You did well, Ogami. 
You cared for those in your command and your judgments were spot-on. 
Also… let's see. You shouldn't view these numbers as a complete reflection of the battle's outcome, but… 
The number of enemies destroyed should be used as one rubric to evaluate your troops. 
The one with the most enemies shot down during the last battle was Sakura. 
Sakura's technique shines when the enemies line up facing the same direction. 
Guide her well. You should predict where the enemy will move, and order Sakura accordingly. 
The one with the most enemies shot down during the last battle was Sumire. 
Sumire's technique is especially powerful when she is surrounded by enemies. 
However, that doesn't mean you should send her off alone. 
The one with the most enemies shot down during the last battle was Maria. 
Maria is great as a back-line fighter. She excels when she's firing over the shoulders on the front line. 
With her skills, you can trust that she'll never accidentally hit an ally. 
The one with the most enemies shot down during the last battle was Kanna. 
Kanna has great attacks, so she can fight at the front line. However, this means she shouldn't be at the back. 
The one with the most enemies shot down during the last battle was Iris. 
Since she is able to move around the battlefield freely, she might be best suited for supporting the others. 
The one with the most enemies shot down during the last battle was Kohran. 
Kohran's bombs have a large explosion radius, so you should aim her attacks where enemies are clustered. 
Her performance was truly inspiring. 
Take this as proof of her trust in you as a commanding officer, Ogami. 
You think so…? Well, thank you, ma'am. 
I suppose that summarizes the situation regarding the last battle…Is there anything else? 
No, thank you, ma'am. 
Oh, but… Ogami. About the upcoming mission… 
…Please be careful. I don't hear good rumors about that abandoned mansion. 
Huh…? W-what do you mean? 
At the time of westernization, a noble family apparently summoned an engineer from England and built the mansion. 
At some point, strange rumors began to spread and even after the owner left the house… the strange events have continued. 
For that reason, because it's been abandoned, the inside must be in ruins. 
The floor plan won't be constructed in the Taisho style so don't get lost. 
Understood… though I have enough to worry about with Sumire and Kanna along. 
It's because people with different origins and backgrounds are living under one roof… 
There are going to be conflicts. It was like that until now…and it will continue to be that way. 
Ogami. I'm counting on you to take care of them. 
This is the outside of Iris's room. 
…She might be sleeping already. I should be quiet. 
…Maybe she's still angry. It's in my best interest to keep quiet. 
Hellooooooooo! 
Hi, Mon Frère! 
Hey, Iris. Did I wake you up? 
Nope! I wasn't sleepy so I was just sitting around. Come in! 
Ok, I'll come in…just for a little bit. 
Hey, hey, Mon Frère. I can't sleep…Tell me a story. 
A story? Hmm… 
"The Monkey and the Crab." <br> The Western "Cinderella." <br> "Stories of my Past." 
Great, okay, I'll tell you the story of "The Battle of the Monkey and the Crab! 
Yay! I don't know that one! Hey, what's a "battle?" 
That's right, you were born in France, weren't you? 
A "battle" is… like a "war," but in this story, it means something like a "fight." 
Huh! Mr. Monkey and Mr. Crab's fight? So, what happens? 
(Uhhh… huh? Who appears in the story, again?) 
A bee, a chestnut, and a cow <br> A bee, a monster, and a cow <br> A bird, a chestnut, and a cow 
(That's right! It was a bee, a chestnut, and a cow!) 
Okay, I'll tell you the story. The beginning of "The Battle of the Monkey and the Crab" starts now! 
Yay! Tell me! Tell me! 
Once upon a time, in a far off place… 
And then… 
However… 
And so… 
…And so, thanks to the cooperation between the bee, the chestnut, and the cow… 
The crab was able to have his revenge on the monkey. And they all lived happily ever after. 
Yay! That was really great for Mr. Crab. 
What did you think, Iris? 
Yeah! It was really interesting! Thank you, Mon Frère! 
You're welcome. Okay, I'm going to get going. Sweet dreams. 
You be careful, too, Frère! Good night! 
(Right. I'm sure it was a bee, a monster, and a cow.) 
Okay, I'll tell you the story. The beginning of "The Battle of the Monkey and the Crab" starts now! 
Yay! Tell me! Tell me! 
Once upon a time, in a far off place… 
And then… 
However… 
And so… 
…The crab went with the monkey, the bee, and the cow, but the monster went to the Island. 
The crab got rid of the monster completely, and took all the treasure. And they all lived happily ever after! 
Yay! It all worked out! 
What did you think, Iris? 
Yeah! It was super interesting! I was a little nervous when the monster was being defeated! 
(I don't think that's exactly how the story went. It bothers me a little but…well, it's fine.) 
I'm glad you liked it. Okay, I'm going to get going. Sweet dreams. 
You be careful, too, Frère! Good night! 
(Right. I think it was a sparrow, a chestnut, and a cow.) 
Okay, I'll tell you the story. The beginning of "The Battle of the Monkey and the Crab" starts now! 
Yay! Tell me! Tell me! 
And then… 
However… 
And so… 
The crab chose the small wicker basket and became very rich… 
The monkey chose the big wicker basket and was stung by the bee inside it. And they all lived happily ever after! 
…What did you think, Iris? 
Ahahahaa! That was really funny! I laughed so hard my stomach hurts! 
But I wonder why there was a bee inside the biggest basket. 
Uh, uhh… To show that greed will only disappoint you, of course. 
(I don't think that's exactly how the story went. It bothers me a little but… well, it's fine.) 
Okay, I'm going to get going. Sweet dreams. 
Thanks, Frère! Tell me another interesting story sometime, okay! Good night! 
(Oh, no, I forgot! Well, I guess I'll just say something!) 
Okay, I'll tell you the story. The beginning of "The Battle of the Monkey and the Crab" starts now! 
Yay! Tell me! Tell me! 
…And so it was that the crab and the monkey would go head to head. 
The game was Rock, Paper, Scissors! The fierce battle took their breath away. Their fists were flying! And then… 
The crab beat the monkey with "scissors!" And the crab's hand remained as scissors to this day. 
And they all lived happily every after! …I don't think that was exactly how the story went. 
Ahahahahaa! That was really funny! I laughed so hard my stomach hurts! 
I'm glad you liked it. Okay, I'm going to get going. Sweet dreams. 
Thanks, Frère! Tell me another interesting story sometime, okay! Good night! 
Uhh, long ago, there was a very beautiful maiden called "Cinderella"… 
I know that one! That's a story for little kids! 
Uh… Well, I thought you'd like it… 
Frère! You're thinking of me as a child and making fun of me again, aren't you?! 
N-n-no, that's not true! It was just a little joke. A joke! 
R-right! I was going to head to Fukagawa. Well, see you, Iris! 
What?! He ran away! Now I really hate you, Frère! 
Okay, this is a bit more of a grown-up story, "Stories of my Past" 
Okay… right. I was admitted to military school in April, when the cherry blossoms were falling… 
Zzz… 
I-Iris!? You're sleeping… S-somehow I feel like this is my fault. 
Oh well. I should leave the room quietly, so I don't wake her… 
…… 
What's wrong, Frère? 
W-well, how about we do the really great "The Story of the Amazing Person"? 
Yay! Tell me! Tell me! 
And then… 
However… 
And so… 
…And so, they became a really wonderful person. What did you think, Iris…? 
…That was boring. 
O-oh… Sorry. 
W-well, I'm going to get going. Sweet dreams! 
Yeah… bye. 
Oh, Ogami. Welcome. 
Oh, Ogami. What's wrong? 
Please come again. 
Let's talk about some juicy gossip. 
Alright. 
Do you need something? 
(That ribbon in her hair… it really suits her.) 
(I'd say that's a good charm point to go with Kasumi's mature looks.) 
(Not a hair out of place.) 
(She really does have beautiful hair… she must spend a lot of time getting ready every day.) 
(Kasumi has a very calm expression…) 
(She looks nice, but I bet she's scary if you get her angry… She's kind of the reliable older sister type.) 
…is something the matter, Ogami? 
Oh, no, it's nothing, Kasumi. 
(There's a quiet, calm look in her eyes.) 
(Kasumi always looks people right in the eyes when she talks to them.) 
(Those traditional Japanese clothes look great on her.) 
(Her demeanor is so calm, but it seems like she has no free time…I wonder if she has experience with martial arts.) 
(Gotta love the chest areas on traditional Japanese clothes…) 
…… 
(She's actually got quite a…) 
Ogami! Please, I'd rather you didn't… 
Oh, sorry… 
I wonder if the show can continue like this until next month. I'm worried. 
Ogami, couldn't you get Kanna and Sumire to make up somehow? 
When you put it like that… hmm… It's very difficult… 
Please, Ogami. You're our only hope. 
I hope they don't fight in Fukagawa… But I'm worried. 
Ogami, I'm sure it'll be a challenge but try your best. 
Do you need me for anything? 
(She's got her scarf pinned with a brooch.) 
(I wonder what it's made of… Couldn't be a real jewel, right?) 
… are you interested in this brooch? Oh, hey, listen to this, I actually got it super cheap at a bargain sale. 
…… 
(The way Yuri's hair curls away from her face is one of her charm points…) 
(That bouncy look is pretty trendy.) 
Is something odd about my hair? Oh no~, I've got some split ends! 
(Her face is small and balanced. I think even a model would be jealous.) 
(It doesn't seem like she uses a lot of make-up. Well, she's got a nice foundation, I don't think she needs it…) 
What's wrong, Ogami? You've been staring at my face for a while… Haha, you're in love with me, aren't you! 
Hey, you shouldn't be teasing an adult. 
Hehehe… sorry, Ogami. 
(Her eyes are shining with curiosity.) 
(Yumi's got a reputation for loving juicy gossip…) 
Hey, Ogami. Have you heard any good rumors lately? 
(Her clothes are pretty colorful.) 
(Maybe she's going for that popular bus guide look?) 
Something the matter, Ogami? 
No I was just thinking… your outfit is pretty cute. 
Oh, you noticed? I'm glad you like it! I actually coordinated this outfit myself. 
Is that so? 
(Goodness… that's certainly an aggressive neckline…) 
(But… isn't this supposed to be a uniform?) 
Ahaha, Ogami. I see you've been stricken by my allure~! 
…Whoa, whoa! (You aren't Sumire, you know.) 
Fukagawa…? That's going to be something… Somehow, there are a lot of awful rumors surrounding that mansion. 
You know, in Fukagawa…there's a lovely view from the hill… 
Now, that place has an eerie feeling. Like something is going to happen… 
Ogami, Kanna isn't always calm, so pay attention to her, okay? 
If she gets sulky even once, it'll be a disaster! 
Ogami, if you care for Kanna, don't leave her side! 
Ogami! After Iris, the word is you're going on a date with Sumire. 
How did that rumor get started! 
Alone inside the abandoned mansion…just the two of you searching…it's just the right mood! 
…Really? It just sounds creepy to me… 
It's Sumire. She is strong, but she must want someone by her side 
I don't hear many good things about the Fukagawa Mansion… 
What… do you hear? 
I hear things about strange people hanging around, moaning coming from the building night after night, things like that… 
Hey, hey… don't frighten me… 
Sakura is… very popular with both children and adults. 
Sumire often receives flowers from young members of the nobility. 
Maria-san's popular among men AND women. Her performances are just that good. 
It's pretty easy to see why Iris is so popular, though mostly just among our more elderly guests. 
Honestly… I really don't get where Kohran's popularity comes from… 
Kanna's super popular among the kids. 
That's right, Iris has been sleeping a lot lately. She said she is going to take a nap today as well… 
Hmmm… She is? 
I wonder if something's wrong…? 
It's hard even though it's summer, isn't it, Ogami? 
Isn't it hard for you having so many more customers than usual? 
Yes. Kanna in particular is very popular with the children. 
Kanna's pictures fly off the shelves. 
It's quite busy, but when I see all the children, I don't mind at all. 
You really like your job, don't you, Tsubaki? 
Of course. But I have to keep getting better. 
Welcome, Ogami! Is there something you need? 
(A shopkeeper's outfit. Tsubaki looks good in it.) 
H, hey, Ogami! Where do you think you're looking? Stop! 
Ogami… come on, don't stare at me like that. It's embarrassing. 
Thanks for your business! Come again! 
Is there something on my face? 
Chief, thanks for that! They'll be remodeled ASAP. I hope you're looking forward to the finished product! 
(I don't want to be in the way. I guess I'll go to the hangar for now.) 
Chief, you're just in time. I want your opinion on the Koubu maintenance… 
What's this? Leaving without hardly saying a word? That's not very nice… 
You haven't even heard what I was going to say so why are you so restless? 
If it's something I can help with then please let me know. 
Okay, well, I do have something I want to ask. 
Actually, right now I'm servicing the Koubu, and I'm updating them while I'm at it! 
What? That's amazing!! 
And so, I want you to decide whether I should focus on their offensive or defensive abilities. 
In that case, I'll happily share my opinion! 
Well, considering the budget, an "update" really means more a "slight improvement" but… 
Well, let's hurry up and go then. 
Do you want to make your own Koubu more offensive or more defensive? 
Ramp up the offenses! <br> Beef up the defenses! 
Offense is the best defense, right? That's a very Chief-like choice. 
Okay, next is Maria's Koubu. Which will you choose? 
Alright. I'm making the armor lighter so I think that should increase the evasion rate a little. 
Okay, next is Maria's Koubu. Which will you choose? 
Let's go with offensive. <br> Make it defensive. 
Got it. Maria's Koubu will be offensive. 
Next is Sakura's Koubu. Which will you choose, Chief? 
Got it. Maria's Koubu will be defensive. 
Next is Sakura's Koubu. Which will you choose, Chief? 
Let's make it offensive. <br> Defensive would be best. 
Okay, you want Sakura's Koubu to be offensive. It's exactly as I thought. 
Next is Sumire's Koubu. Which one? 
Oh, you want Sakura's Koubu to be defensive? That could be very interesting. 
Next is Sumire's Koubu. Which one? 
Offensive, I suppose. <br> How about defensive? 
Of course. Sumire's will be offensive. 
Next is Kanna's. What do you think? 
Of course. Sumire's will be defensive. 
Next is Kanna's. What do you think? 
Offensive. <br> How about defensive? 
You're going to make Kanna's Koubu offensive then? 
What will you do with Iris' Koubu that just entered battle not long ago? 
Defensive, huh…? That might actually work pretty well. 
What will you do with Iris' Koubu that just entered battle not long ago? 
Let's make it offensive. <br> How about defensive? 
I think Iris is going to be a great asset in battle, so I think that's fine. 
Finally, which do you want my Koubu to be? I think I should make it offensive… 
That sounds good to me. <br> Yours should be defensive. 
Exactly! If you don't attack then you can't win, right? 
Alright, my Koubu will be offensive. 
No, when I think about your style, Kohran, I think that yours should be defensive. 
Hmm…my "style," huh? Of course… 
…… 
Understood. I'll do as you say and make my Koubu defensive! 
Now, it's just whether we have enough funds. If we go over budget, even the things we could do won't be doable. 
Uhh, so, add the cost of materials… Hmm… multiplied by six… and the overall expense is… 
...Chief, what's 1250 plus 970?
…Is it 2120? <br> Uh… 2200. <br> No, 2320. 
…Right! Chief, you're so smart. You fixed it! 
Uh, no, I mean… Hahahaha. 
…Is it 2220? What's wrong, Chief? You're taking forever. 
C-crap! I was so close… 
Really? Uhhh… wait! You're wrong, Chief! 
S-sorry… 
No, no, that's alright. Everyone makes mistakes! 
…Somehow I think I'll be able to stay within the budget. Okay, let's do it! 
I'm sorry for making you help me for so long. You really helped me though. 
I'm looking forward to our updated Koubu. Good luck. 
Thanks. Be careful. See you later. 
…Captain. When exactly were you going to Fukagawa? 
Huh? Uh… I was just going r-right now! Haha, see you!! 
(Huh…it looks like Maria and Sakura are talking.) 
Captain, weren't you supposed to go to Fukagawa? 
Yes, I was just going to leave. By the way… What are you two doing? 
We were discussing Iris' fighting style on the battlefield. 
Iris is still in the early days of her battling career. 
We were thinking if we can help her ease into it somehow. 
You don't seem to be in any hurry, Captain. Would you like to join the discussion? 
Alright, I'm going then… Sorry for interrupting you. 
Goodbye! 
Good luck with Sumire and Kanna. 
Iris is able to move through walls by teleporting. 
Yeah… 
If the situation becomes dangerous, please make her go to a safer place. 
"One pair of heels is worth two pairs of hands,"…they say. 
Wait, I know where that’s from… 
Ancient China? <br> Shingen Takeda? <br> Napoleon? 
That's an ancient Chinese war strategy, isn't it? 
Really, is it? 
That's just like you, Captain. You know a lot of things. 
…What does that mean again? 
Captain… "One pair of heels is worth two pair of hands"… 
It's ancient Chinese war tactic. It means… there is no better safety measure than running away. 
What, really? 
I hadn't realized… 
What, really? 
No! 
It means… there is no better safety measure than running away. 
Really?! That's what it means? 
…… 
Iris still doesn't have much experience with battle. 
You must protect her well, Captain. 
Please, Ogami. 
Shouldn't you be going to the Fukagawa mansion? 
Now that I think of it, Kohran should be servicing the Koubu in the underground hangar. 
Before you leave, why don't go have a look? 
Ogami, if you use Iris's special move, you can undo the damage done to your Koubu. 
In fact, you can revive everyone within a certain area. It's very helpful. 
We've gained a reliable ally. <br> She's doing well, for a child. <br> We can't protect her. 
It seems like we've gotten a reliable ally. 
Absolutely. Iris is going to have the best battle power in the whole Flower Troupe. 
I'll have to make sure I don't fall behind!! 
She's doing so well, even though she's still a child. 
That's true. When I was ten, all I did was play outside in the fields and mountains… 
If I think about it… I feel a little bad for her. 
Sakura, you shouldn't think that. Iris is much more of an adult than you give her credit for. 
And you, Captain. If you treat Iris like a child then things won't go well for you, just like last time. 
Y-yes, you're right. 
But I can't push her too hard. I have to protect her. 
Yes… Unfortunately, in battle, you still can't treat her as an adult. 
Protecting Iris is also one of my important jobs. 
I have to take care of her. 
…How nice for Iris that she gets protected by you. 
…… 
Is something wrong, Ogami? 
Well, Iris is a valuable asset to our team but…her power is still unstable. 
Are you worried that she may fly into another rampage like before?
Yes… 
Captain, believe in Iris. This is the time when she is going to have the most growth. 
That's right, Ogami. 
…Yes, that's true. 
We’ll go on to discuss the best battle tactics for Iris. 
Right. Good luck. 
Thanks! 
I wonder if the manager is around. 
I guess I'll try somewhere else. 
Zzz… zZz… Zzz… 
He's sleeping so well. It looks nice. 
Still not on your way? If you don't hurry the sun will set! 
Yes, that is…I don't have my Koubu… 
Oh, yes, take heart. Even if you did have it, you wouldn't take it. 
What? 
Were you planning on searching the mansion in a huge Koubu? This is a preemptive investigation you know. 
And what's more, we don't have definite information about whether the enemy is actually there or not. 
Besides, we can't enter private premises. 
W-we can't? 
Well, don't look so serious about it! If it gets bad just run away! 
Yes… 
Even if you get caught, protect Sumire and Kanna with everything you have! Got it? 
Absolutely… 
Hey, sorry. Were you waiting long? 
No, it's alright. It's just like you, Ensign. Right on time. 
Yeah, let's go! 
Someone's enthusiastic! You know we're not going on a picnic, right? 
What's that! 
Hey, be nice to each other. 
Alright, we're headed to Fukagawa mansion. Our objective is to scout the area and investigate. 
No loud arguments. 
Hmph! 
Siiiigh, I don't know if I can. 
I'm so sorry. Were you waiting long? …Are you angry? …You definitely look angry. 
Of course I'm angry! I told you that I hate to be kept waiting! 
Honestly…Where were you hanging around at anyway? 
You're the one who's messed up! It's fine if he's late just a little bit! 
Punctuality is the politeness of princes. I only ask that Ensign keep to the scheduled time. 
Well, it's doubtful whether an insensitive woman such as you has any sense of time at all. 
What did you say?! 
Hold on, in the end I was the one who was late. Please stop fighting. 
Alright, we're headed to the mansion. Our objective is to scout and investigate. Fighting is not allowed. 
Hmph! 
Siiiigh, I don't know if I can. 
(Jeez… It's like last time…)

But isn't it the job of the captain to resolve trouble amongst the troops? 
The commander expects you to resolve the issue and that's why he decided on them, don't you think? 
Even I don't know what the enemy plans to do once they have cast a spell on the capital. 
Isn't it your responsibility to find that out, Ogami? 
Ogami… I understand how hard it is with Sumire and Kanna, and the Hive of Darkness. 
But you can't let your doubts show on your face. It makes everyone anxious.
