﻿﻿﻿﻿Yes! With the high levels of spirit energy in this area… there can't be any doubt! 
It's a dead end. 
Fuhahaha! Oh well done, Assault Troupe! 
Isn’t he one of the Hive of Darkness’ followers? 
Guess that means Tenkai isn't here, huh. 
Master…!? Hahaha… 
Seems you haven't learned your lesson after the trouncing I gave you at Ueno Park. 
Sir! We need to take him down and extract Tenkai's location from him! 
Oh, we'll see about that! 
Yaahhh!! 
Sorry for being late, everyone! Sakura Shinguji, engaging the enemy! 
There you are! Finally!… Honestly, girl! 
Captain! Everyone! I located the base of the Hive of Darkness. We need to move on, quickly! 
Really!? 
I'll explain later. I'm going to break through the enemy line! Everyone, follow me! 
I'll make you pay for hurting my friends!! 
Roger!! 
Tenkai… the Assault Troupe… it makes little difference which wins in the end… 
Sumire! It was around here, right? 
We don't have time to waste on an underling like you! Tell us where your master, Tenkai, is! 
Damn! Everyone, prepare for battle! 
…Oga-… it's a tra-… retre-… 
Ayame? Did you say 'trap'? Everyone, keep fighting, but pull back! 
Hahaha… you won't get away! 
Damn, how are we going to get out of this!? 
We're gonna lose! 
Dammit, are we seriously going down like this? 
As long as we can stand, we have to keep fighting! 
Damn! There's too many of them!! 
What're we gonna do, Boss!? 
I can't see a way out of this… but if we're going down we're going down like heroes! 
Sir! It's too early to give up hope! 
If we… if the Imperial Assault Troupe is eliminated here… who will defend the capital!? 
She's right! This isn't the time to be talking about going down, as heroes or any other way! 
We're the only ones who can take out Tenkai… the only ones who can defeat the Hive of Darkness! 
Ensign, let's assume a more defensive formation and look for an opening to break free! 
Everyone, don't gamble your lives! We're in no position to try taking on this number of enemies. 
For now let's take a defensive formation! Then we can look for an opening to escape! 
Understood. It's far too early for Sumire Kanzaki's last curtain call. 
Roger! 
OK, got it! 
Got it! Retreating and regrouping is as good a strategy as any. 
Got it, Boss! No sense throwing away our lives here! 
It's a nice plan and all but… how long can we hold out against this many enemies? 
Sitting here like this… sooner or later we're gonna get overwhelmed. Then it's curtains for us. 
That said… I don't see this ending well for us. 
Just how long can we stand against an enemy force of this size… 
…So you're out of ideas. Looks like they got us… 
It would take a miracle to open a path through this large a force. 
What… What was that!? 
Is that…!? 
The Soaring Whale!! 
Sakura! You're OK!! 
OK, everyone! Follow Sakura!! 
Fight with all your might! <br> Don't throw your lives away! 
I think everyone will be fine without my protection. 
I will protect you, Sakura! 
I'll always be there to protect you, Sumire. 
Let me watch your back for you, Maria. 
I'll always be there for you, Iris. 
Don't worry, Kohran! I'll protect you! 
Kanna! I've got your back! 
I've got to focus! 
Here I go! 
Leave it to me!! 
Watch this, Ogami. 
I'm fine, I can still fight… 
Thank you! 
Keep it up, Ogami! 
I knew I could count on you! 
Kyaaa! 
Ngh, I'll show you next time! 
I'm sorry… Ogami… 
It's my turn in the spotlight. 
Hahaha! 
I'm off!! 
Today's performance is all for you! 
It'll take more than that to bring me down… 
Ensign, so you really do care for me… 
Come, Ensign, it's your move! 
I'll be watching you! 
Uwahhh!! 
I suppose I'll let you win for now! 
The captain needs me!! 
I'll have to take down the enemies myself! 
Where's my next target!? 
Whoever wants to die first, just step forward… 
I'll be relying on your orders, sir! 
I'm not finished yet!! Not yet!! 
You would go that far… for my sake… 
Focus, sir! 
We'll make it out of this alive, sir! 
Ahhh!! 
They're too strong!! I need to withdraw!! 
Forgive me, sir. I need to withdraw! 
I can fight too! 
Here I go! 
I'm super strong! 
I'll fight hard for Mon Frère!! 
Uh, some of these lights are flashing… 
You're the best, Mon Frère! 
Go get 'em Mon Frère! 
I'll be watching! 
Kyaaaa!! 
Stupid… stars… 
Sorry, Mon Frère… 
Gonna go all out. 
Better not underestimate science~! 
Movin' out!! 
Check this out! 
I'm takin' too much damage here! 
Aww, you're the best! 
I'm rootin' for ya! 
Take 'em down, Boss! 
Uwahhh… 
Dangit… they got me… 
Sorry Chief… 
All right! Let's do this!! 
Full power! Hiyaaaaa! 
Feast your eyes on the killer techniques of the Kirishima! 
Let's take 'em down, Boss!! 
No problem! It's just a scratch!! 
Thanks! I owe you one! 
Get in there, Boss! 
Let's see what you can do! 
Uwahhh… 
Damn. Guess I still haven't trained enough… 
I've gotta keep fighting… for the Boss. 
All right! 
We did it! 
We did it! 
Phew! 
Nice one! 
Woo! We did it!!
