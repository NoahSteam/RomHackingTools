You did well to make it this far… It's finally time for us to settle the score. 
Please, move aside, Ayame.

If you insist on getting in our way, we'll have no choice… 
No choice but to do what… 
Heh heh heh… Can you bring yourself to defeat me, Ogami? 
Ayame… 
Heh heh heh… How adorable. Come, let's put an end to this, just you and me. 
Commander, wait! 
It's all right. I'll find a way to bring her around. Don't try to interfere. 
I've been looking forward to this…we can finally put an end to this. I won't let anyone get in the way.

Something's wrong with the main engine. Our power output is going down fast! 
The auxiliary engines are all out of action! There's no way we can fix them on the fly! 
Port-side cannons, out of action! 
Yaaaaaargh!

What?! Even the Mikasa is no match for them…? 
This doesn't change our objective! We must protect the capital at all costs! 
Oh, Lord… Even if it costs me my life, please, let justice be done…! 
Our main cannon's been completely destroyed! 
What?! 
The port-side anti-aircraft cannons have caught fire! 
Raaargh! 
We've lost our auto-flight regulators! We won't be able to stay in the air much longer! 
Switch to manual controls! I'll take the helm. We're not done yet!
