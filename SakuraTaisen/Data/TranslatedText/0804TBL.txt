﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿It's a photo of Sakura. She's looking right at me. I wonder what she's thinking…
It's a photo of Sumire. This is a side of her you don't see too often.
It's a photo of Maria. She's lost in thought and looks kind of sad…

A photo of Iris. She's surrounded by flowers and flashing a radiant smile.
A photo of Kohran. She's looking pretty in profile with her face dyed red by the evening sun.
A letter given to me by a customer. I was asked to give it to Sumire. I have a bad feeling about this…
Maria's pistol. This may help me escape from here…
A hair ornament. It's decorated with flowers and looks very elegant.
A pretty pendant. The delicate workmanship is gorgeous.
A hairpin for use in a traditional bun hairstyle. It would complement a formal outfit well.
This key will let me enter rooms I couldn't before.
I found this in a bedroom on the second floor. I can use it to access the back room.
A set of cups Iris asked me to get for her. They have a very stylish design.
This is the matchbox Iris asked for. Its logo is quite colorful.
Some knives Iris asked me to get for her. Just a normal utensil you'd use during a meal.

January 2nd. Imperial City Daily Report. News Extra 
"A New Enemy Has Appeared!" "Mass Chaos at Meiji Shrine!" 
Hideous monsters appeared at Meiji Shrine the other day. It was a desperate struggle for the Imperial Flower Division.
Bizarre beasts appeared during New Years Day celebrations at the crowded Shrine, causing mass hysteria. 
The Flower Division was dispatched, and victorious, yet seriously injured. Were the group’s battlesuits destroyed?
Citizens of the Imperial capital are unable to hide their shock at the appearance of this new threat. 
With all due respect… <br> It's my responsibility… 
With all due respect, Lt. General Yoneda, the Koubu were no match for that enemy. 
Ogami! What the hell are you saying?! Aren't you the commanding officer of the Flower Division!? 
Were you only taught to talk crap at military school?? 
… 
I'm sorry… It's my fault. I am fully prepared to receive the punishment I deserve. 
You damn fool! What good will it do us if you resign your post?! 
And… the Koubu were totally destroyed! 
…I have no words. 
Jeez… we’re going to have to face this new enemy somehow with our precious Spirit Armor in pieces… 
I… I'm so ashamed…! 
First the Hive of Darkness, and now this new threat… the citizens are terrified… 
And because everyone is hiding away in their houses out of fear, the economy has totally broken down. 
The big shots up in government have been giving me nothing but grief about this incident since yesterday. 
No wonder my stomach is killing me. 
Are you sure that's not being caused by all the alcohol you drink…? 
Did you just say something? 
No, I didn't say anything! 
Better not have, Ogami! 
We can't just assume there'll be peace because we defeated the Hive of Darkness! 
If I see any more shameful behavior out of you, I'll be demoting you to full-time ticket collector! 
Fu… Full-time ticket collector!? 
If you don't like it, I suggest you hurry up and think of a counterattack against these monsters quick-like! 
Y-Yes, sir! 
If you got it, then go already! 
Y-Yes! Excuse me! 
…
Even so… if there are monsters like that still alive out there… 
The Kouma… 
Six years ago… Lt. General Yoneda and the Anti-Kouma Corps managed to seal away the Kouma beneath the earth… 
I wonder if Cerulean Satan's minions have been resurrected in the city now… 
If the Koubu aren’t repaired quickly… it will be real trouble for the capital. 
Yes, just a minute… 
Chief… sorry for comin' in so late. 
…What's wrong, Kohran? 
…I, uh, got somethin' I wanna talk to ya about. Mind if I… come in? 
…All right. Come inside then. 
…Kohran? 
Kohran… what could she possibly wish to talk with the Ensign about at this hour… 
…So then, Kohran. What exactly did you want to talk about? 
Lemme cut right to the chase… there isn't much chance of the Koubu getting repaired. 
What? 
I took a look at them, but the Koubu’s spirit engines are totally busted. It'll be real difficult to fix… 
And frankly, even if I could fix them… they wouldn’t stand a chance against the enemy next time. 
…So we need a weapon other than the Koubu, you mean… 
Well, that won’t be easy, either. The Imperial Assault Troupe sucks up tons of money and makes almost nothing back. 
Developing, maintaining and improving the Spirit Armor… who knows how much all that’ll cost us. 
Not only are the Koubu in pieces but the capital’s economy is also shaky 'cause of this new enemy.
There's just no way we could make new Spirit Armor at a time like this… 
What about a loan…? 
…Hm?! 
What's up, Chief? Ya look a bit scary… 
Sorry… Did you hear something just now? 
Nope, I didn't hear nothin'. Maybe it was just your imagination? 
Maybe… 
Chief… What are we gonna do? 
Go and talk to Yoneda. <br> Go and talk to Ayame. 
Chief, there’s nothing we can do about the Koubu right now. 
We should talk to Yoneda and see if he can give us a hand somehow. 
In the meantime, why don't we figure out if there's something each of us can do on our own?
Good idea. Get everyone to meet in the War Room. 
Got it. 
Right… I'll go and talk to the commander. 
This isn't a problem I can solve on my own. I’ll discuss the situation with Yoneda. 
…All right. I'll go and get everyone from the Flower Division together in the War Room. 
Please do. 
OK… I should go to the manager's office. 
It's Ogami. I'd like to talk to you. 
Come in! 
Excuse me. 
Sir, the truth is… 
This is about the Koubu, I suppose? 
Yes, exactly. The Koubu's potential is exhausted, and our funds are limited… 
Can't you do anything about this? 
I've been wracking my brain about this whole pickle… 
Can I ask you to leave the whole thing to me? 
Really? But… 
Trust me, I’ve got a plan, but it'll take some time. So, Ogami… 
You do your job and put some spirit back in the Flower Division! 
Understood. I’ll take my leave. 
The members of the Flower Division should be gathered in the War Room by now. 
I can't solve this problem alone. I'll ask Ayame for help. 
…All right. I'll go and get everyone from the Flower Division together in the War Room. 
Please do. 
OK… I should go see Ayame. 
It's Ogami… do you have a minute? 
Oh, Ogami? Come right in. How can I help you? 
I'm sorry to disturb you so late. To be honest, I need your help… 
…About the Koubu, right? 
Yes… It pains me to say it, but I have no idea what we should do… 
Don't beat yourself up about it. This problem is just too big. 
Producing entirely new Spirit Armors… that would be a national effort. 
Yes… 
I'll have a word with Lieutenant General Yoneda about the Koubu. I think he had some kind of idea. 
But, Ogami… could I offer you a word of advice? 
I mentioned it before, but the most important thing for a leader is to not waver in your decision-making. 
…Understood. 
But additionally, you mustn't cause your teammates undue concern. 
…! 
You can bet they all feel as uneasy as you about the loss of the Koubu. 
You need to act as positively as possible. 
If you can't keep it together, they'll only feel all the more worried. 
I'm sure you can figure out the rest yourself. Good luck, Ogami. 
…All right. 
Everyone should be in the War Room by now. 
Looks as though everyone's gathered. 
Yes… all right, let’s begin.
We need a strategy to fight those monsters… the Kouma. 
First off, let’s hear your thoughts, Boss. 
What can we do to stand against those monsters? 
Go back to training. <br> Get more powerful weapons. 
We all need to go back to training. The Koubu are only as strong as their pilots. 
The Flower Division can only become stronger as a unit if we first grow stronger as individuals. 
Go back to our roots, you mean? 
In order to stand against the Kouma, we need more powerful weapons. 
That's a tough one, Chief… 
… 
Oh, right… I already asked for help with that problem. 
All right… it seems we have to come up with a different solution. 
Captain… the fighting capabilities of the Spirit Armor grows in proportion with the abilities of their pilots. 
Even using the same Koubu as before, if we grow stronger, we'll be much more powerful in battle. 
Chief! This is an important meeting, so how can you space out like that!? 
Yes, er… Sorry… 
Oh boy… are we really out of ideas? 
…I have a proposal. 
The fighting capabilities of the Spirit Armor grows in proportion with the abilities of the pilot. 
Even if we use the same Koubu as before, if we grow stronger ourselves, we'll be much more powerful in battle. 
Back to basics, eh? Not bad. 
OK, then I'll return to the remote mountains where I practiced karate! 
And I'll ask my old sword fighting master for a refresher. 
OK! So, all of you… 
I'm not too keen on special training. 
Do we really HAVE to do that? 
…Huh? 
I think it would be much better to build new Koubu! 
I agree. In any case, this is not an enemy we can fight unarmed. 
But don't you think the ones who've steeled their spirit will survive the longest? 
If that's what you believe, then hide yourself in the mountains and continue your karate training… 
Maybe you'll become king of the jungle while you’re at it! 
What’d you say!? 
Settle down, you two! 
…What shall we do, Captain? 
Time for special training! <br> Leave it to their judgment. 
All right, it's time for some special training! 
I want each of you to go back to your original fields of expertise and try to rekindle that flame that we've lost. 
Right! 
OK! 
How about the rest of you? 
… 
… 
I will follow your orders, Captain… 
…And you, Kohran? 
Well… even special training isn't like flipping a switch to become stronger in a few days. 
Different strokes for different folks. That's true for mind and body. Right, Chief? 
Even if you think this is good for some of us, it might not be ideal for everyone. 
But… 
Besides, I'm busy with a new invention at the moment. 
All right, enough of this! If someone doesn't agree, I won't force them to do anything. 
It's obvious to all of us that we can't win against the Kouma as we are now. 
…OK. I’ll leave it to your discretion. 
Ogami? 
I'm sure every one of us knows in our hearts what we have to do. 
Please do whatever you see fit… as long as it will help us fight the Kouma! 
…What is it, Captain? 
I suppose it can’t be helped… 
Kohran. 
Yeah? 
Contact the Hanayashiki workshop and improve the Koubu as much as you can! 
Roger! 
I'll leave the rest of you to make your own decisions. Do you agree, Captain? 
Very well then, we'll follow our own judgement. 
Yay, I’m gonna take lots of naps! 
…Thanks, Chief. 
Oh boy, maybe I'm out of practice? 
Heheh… Looks like I won this time. 
Not so fast, this isn't over! 
Hmm, I’m so close… 
Wow, you bought a LOT of stuff! 
Hohoho… Next, I need a new dress! Then we'll have some tea when we return. 
And then… it's nappy time! 
I'll show you all! I know I can do it… I'll show you I'm stronger than even my father! 
The way of the sword is the way of the heart. Your heart speaks through your sword… fast and light…

What kind of moronic article did these idiots write? 
Haha… Don’t you think you were a bit hard on him, Lieutenant General? 
It was just enough to shake that brainless moron out of his holiday mood. Besides… 
"In prosperity, prepare for adversary". Even in times of peace, we can't let our guard down. 
In our last fight against the Hive, we didn't finish the job. 
This Cerulean Satan… He may be even more dangerous than Tenkai. 
Giyaah… Gyagyagyaaaahh! 
At last, the time has come for you to emerge to the surface. 
Kill every living thing in this world… Drink their blood and eat their flesh… 
But first, we must rid ourselves of those pesky humans who stand in our way. 
A formidable foe awaits you… 
Giyaah… Gyagyagyaaaahh!
