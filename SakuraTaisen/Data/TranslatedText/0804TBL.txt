It's a photo of Sumire. This is a side of her you don't see too often.

A photo of Kanna. Kanna's signature strength comes through clearly.
A photo of Iris. She's surrounded by flowers and flashing a radiant smile.
A photo of Kohran. She's looking pretty in profile with her face dyed red by the evening sun.
A letter given to me by a customer. I was asked to give it to Sumire. I have a bad feeling about this…
Maria's pistol. This may help me escape from here…
A hair ornament. It's decorated with flowers and looks very elegant.
A pretty pendant. The delicate workmanship is gorgeous.
A hairpin for use in a traditional bun hairstyle. It would complement a formal outfit well.
This key will let me enter rooms I couldn't before.
I found this in a bedroom on the second floor. I can use it to access the back room.
A teacup Iris asked me to get for her. It has a very stylish design.
This is the matchbox Iris asked for. Its logo is quite colorful.

2nd January. Imperial City Daily Report. News Extra
"A New Enemy Has Appeared". "Mass Chaos at Meiji Shrine"
A hideous monster has appeared at Meiji Shrine. It was a desperate struggle for the Flower division of the Imperial Combat Revue.
The bizarre-looking beast appeared on the grounds of Meiji Shrine, which was crowded with people visiting to wish in the new year, and caused mass hysteria in the area for a time.
The Flower division of the Imperial Combat Revue were subsequently dispatched. Although able to drive the enemy back, they sustained serious injury. Have the Spirit Armor and Koubu been destroyed?
It seems that the citizens of the imperial capital are unable to hide their shock at the appearance of a new demon.
With all due respect… <br> It's my responsibility…
With all due respect, Commander Yoneda. Their "Koubu" was no match for that enemy.
Ogamii! What the hell are you saying?! Aren't you the commanding officer of the Flower division!?
Were you only taught to talk crap at military school??
…
I'm sorry… It's my fault. I am fully prepared to receive the punishment I deserve.
You bloody idiot! If you go off and kill yourself now then it's all over!!
And yet… the Koubu was totally destroyed!
…I have no words.
Geez… we're gonna have to go back without a single piece left of our precious Spirit Armor…
I… I'm so ashamed…!
The Hive of Darkness will come after the inhabitants of the Imperial City next. They will be very afraid of these new threats…
And cos everyone's just hiding away in their houses now the economy has totally broken down.
The big shots up in government have been giving me nothing but shit about this since yesterday.
No wonder my stomach is killing me.
Are you sure that's not just cos you drink too much…
Did you just say something??
No, I didn't say anything!
Better not have, Ogami!
We can't just assume there'll be peace once the Hive of Darkness are defeated!
If I see any more bad behavior out of you I'll be demoting you to full-time ticket collector!
F…full-time ticket collector!?
If you don't like it I suggest you hurry up and think of a counterattack against these monsters quick smart!
Y, yes sir!
If you got it then go already!
Y, yes! Excuse me!
……
Even so… if there are monsters like that still alive out there…
The kouma…
Six years ago… Lieutenant General Yoneda and the Anti-Kouma Corps managed to seal away the kouma in other bases…
I wonder if Aoi Satan's hands have been resurrected in the city now…
If the Koubu isn't healed quickly… it will be real trouble for the Imperial City.
Yes, just a minute…
Ogami… sorry for comin' in so late.
…What's wrong, Kohran?
…I uh, got somethin' I wanna talk to ya about. Mind if I… come in?
…Alright. Come inside then.
…Kohran?
Kohran… what could she possibly want to talk to the Ensign about at this time…
…So then, Kohran. What on earth did you want to talk about?
If I get right to the point… there ain't much chance of the Koubu gettin' repaired.
What?
I had a look at it, but the Koubu's spirit engine is totally bust. It'll be real difficult to fix…
And frankly, even if I could fix it… it's got no chance against the enemy next time.
…So we need a weapon other than the Koubu, you mean…
Well, that ain't that easy either. This Imperial Combat Revue sucks up loads of cash and makes nothin' back.
Developin', maintainin' and improvin' the Spirit Armor… who knows how much all that's cost us.
And now the Koubu is totally wrecked… and to make matters worse, there ain't no money in the city either cos of this new enemy.
There's just no way we could make a new Koubu at this kinda time…
What about a loan…?
….Huh!?
What's up, Ogami? Ya look a bit scary…
Sorry… did you hear something just then?
Nope, I didn't hear nothin'. Maybe it was just ya imagination?
Maybe…
Ogami… what are we gonna do?
Go and talk to Yoneda. <br> Go and talk to Ayame.
Ogami, there ain't nothin' we can do about the Koubu thing now.
We should talk to Yoneda and see if he can give us a hand somehow.
Until then, should we gather everyone and see if we can't figure out somethin' together?
Good idea. Get everyone to meet in the tactics room.
Got it.
Right… I'll go and talk to the higher ups.
This isn't a problem I can solve on my own. I will discuss it with Yoneda.
…Alright. I'll go and get everyone from the Flower Division together in the tactics room.

You were always there for me last year. Thank you for everything!
Sakura! I didn't expect such a well-mannered greeting from you!
Thank you. I'll try hard this year to be a proper lady like you, Sumire!
Ohohohoho… Seems like you have finally seen the light!
Hmph… I was planning to make it from Nishijin brocade imported from Kyoto…

Yo, boss! Chinese New Year is still some weeks off though…

Happy New Year, uncle Ichi!
I'll be eleven this year! How long do you think until I can get married?
Oh, really?
You've come a long way as a commander! I have a feeling we've got an awesome year ahead of us.
Like you would know anything about that…
How dare you, you evil hag!
Stop your screaming, gorilla!
Want to pick a fight, you rotten snake?

That makes me happy! Let's get out of here right away.
Just kidding! Hohohoho… How innocent you are!
Untranslated
All right, just what I wanted to hear! Let's get out of here!
Hahaha! All right, let's drink and be merry! Right?
I really like you, boss. Come on then, show me how you celebrate New Year's day in Tokyo. Just the two of us!
This is our little secret… OK, let's go!
Untranslated

Hey, uncle Ichi… Take me to the shrine please!
Just the two of us, having fun. Hihihi… Wouldn't that be nice?
Yaaay, I'm so happy! Let's leave right now!

Even if you're only flattering me, that makes me happy.
Thank you, really.
Ah! The train's here! Let's get on!
What a crowd! So this is what New Year's day is like in Tokyo!
I'm so glad Tokyo is finally at peace…
OK… Let's go too then!
What a crowd…
Of course…

Come on, commander! Let's go.
Quickly!
Oh, not bad! Very festive.
Oh, stop it… You really went all out there.
You're a great guy.
Hey… Do you have to talk shop when it's just the two of us?
But… that's just what I like about you.
Come one, let's go.
So… this is what you do on New Year's day? Not really what I imagined.
Hmmm, it seems to unmotivated, lonely…
Oh, let's light some firecrackers! Then we'll get in the mood!
Really? How boring…
Right. Wanna go on?
Whoaaa… So many people! Don't you think, uncle Ichi?
Hey, hey, hey… What's that real big house over there?
Come on, uncle Ichi!
Let's go already!
I'm not telling.
Let's go then.
Ohohoho… That's a secret.
Should we get going?
Nah, it's nothing…
Wanna get going?
No, it's nothing.
Let's go somewhere else, uncle Ichi!
Not telling!
Step right up, step right up! We've got a monkey straight from China!
How about it? Wanna give it a go, sir?
Let's try it, Mr. Ogami!
Hmph… A childish diversion.
Commander! Let's try that!

Hey, uncle. I wanna try!

Not bad at all!
I'm impressed, boss!

Please come here, Mr. Ogami.
Come here for a moment.
Really, commander… Why did you have to take me to such an out of the way place?
Oh, you don't need to blush. There's no one around who could see us.
Oh, commander! And Sumire, too…
Sakura…
Untranslated
Heya, Sakura! Fancy running into you here!
Wh… Why are you all here?
Untranslated
That's right! Isn't it nice for all of the Flower Division to celebrate New Year together?
Exactly. We wanted to have fun together.
That was fun! Something like this isn't bad once in a while. A bit like a date.
What? What what what? What's with that artificial laugh?
So being with me really isn't enough…?
Oh, commander! And Kanna, too.
S-Sakura!?
Untranslated
Untranslated
Wh-wh-why is everyone here all of a sudden!?
Come on, boss… Where else would we go on New Year's day but the shrine?
That's right! Isn't it nice for all of the Flower Division to celebrate New Year together?
Well… That's it, really.
Phew… There's a bunch of people everywhere. Really makes me tired.
Thanks. Tell me one thing, boss…
Are you happy you visited the shrine with me?n
Really? Makes me happy to hear you say so, boss!
Oh, commander! And Kohran, too.
S-Sakura!?
Untranslated
Oooh, there's Sakura! Yoohoo!
Why's everyone here all of a sudden!?
Ohohoho… Where else would we go on New Year's day but the shrine?
Didn't we agree on celebrating New Year together?
Not really…
That's right! Isn't it nice for all of the Flower Division to celebrate New Year together?
That's it!
Tell me, uncle Ichi… What do you think of me?
Do you… like me?
Hihihi… I love you too, uncle!
Aww, come on! If you wanna confess your love, you have to be serious!
Oh, commander! And Iris, too.
Ah… Sakura!
So you really wanted to visit the shrine with everyone, Mr. Ogami?
Sakura! What are the odds?
Why's everyone here?
Come on, boss… Where else would we go on New Year's day but the shrine?
Just get crazy for once!
That's right! Isn't it nice for all of the Flower Division to celebrate New Year together?
Oh, look… A manifestation of the North Star Buddha!
I have to pay my respects, as a user of the North Star Fencing style.
Daaaaaaaa!
Whoa…
Untranslated
We just followed you!
We can't let you have all the fun!
Ohohohoho…
Don't surprise me like that! You just wanted to give me scare!
Let's all visit the shrine together!
That's right! Isn't it nice for all of the Flower Division to celebrate New Year together?
Right on! That's what I like about you!
It feels like we're being watched…
Hahahaha…!
That voice…
Over there!
So we meet again, my friends of the Imperial Floral Storm Troop!
My name is Aoi Satan!
The Black Web…? Don't make me laugh.
That Tenkai's finished for good. After all, he was nothing more than the shogunate's lap dog.
But I, Aoi Satan, am of a different breed! I'll never give up!
Your precious peace won't continue forever. Pray all you want!
A ridiculous man like you, so easily bewitched by the charms of women…
You'll never stop me.
I'll level this city for good. All humans will cower before me!
What I want? Hehehehe…
I just can't stand the sight of happy humans!
On the other hand, nothing excites me like the look of pain and fear in their eyes!
You won't get to enjoy that on our watch!
I'll destroy everyone and everything you love!
What!?
Hihihi… Come to me, all ye children of the gutter, all ye oppressed and evil!
I am the great liberator of demons! Come forth, Koma!
That's…!?
Gihi… Gihihihihi!
What the hell?
Look out, everyone!

Ah! The Shogeimaru!
Seems like we just made it!
The Shogeimaru! We're saved!

Yeah!!
You should work hard and follow my example so you can make your debut in high society.
By the way, Mr. Ogami, what do you think about this dress? Isn't it a little too plain?
Hmph… I was planning to make it from Nishijin brocade imported from Kyoto…
I wanted to wear a luxurious long-sleeved kimono. Such a pity…
Yeah, yeah… Suits you perfectly, Sumire, like always.
Do I detect some sarcasm in your tone?
Ahahaha, what gave you that idea? I was being honest! Wasn't I, boss?
Why the sudden silence, Mr. Ogami?!
Indecisive as ever!
But I'm right, aren't I? Whatever you're wearing, it always suits you!
Ooooohohohoho! Looks like you finally learned to appreciate my beauty.
So, Mr. Ogami… If you're going to visit the shrine, I could accompany you.
You don't look very busy to me, commander! Come one… Let's celebrate New Year's day, just the two of us!
What!? You gonna turn me down, boss?
That's just… I hate you! To play with my feelings like that…
Boohoo… I hate you, uncle! So you don't like me after all!
Commander… Would you like to take me to the shrine?
In my country, we didn't have this custom…
Oh, really? I understand.
Really? I'll come by your room later then.
Ogami? What's up?
What? With me?
A New Year's shrine visit with you… Hihi, that doesn't sound so bad.
But… I'm sorry. I can't really leave my post right now.
Just take one of the girls. Didn't some of them ask you already?
Everyone wanted to go with you.
You shouldn't let them wait too long.
Oh, and one more thing… "He who runs after two hares will catch neither". Keep that in mind.
Hihi, why not? It's only New Year's day once a year, so let's get a little crazy.
Take care of the girls! Don't mess this up, Ogami.
Untranslated
Sorry. I wanted to stop them all…
I never expected a day like this to come…
To finally be able to enjoy these carefree days…
You're right… I could never go back to what I was like back then.
Oh, what am I saying? I shouldn't dwell on those old stories.
New Year's day in Russia?
It's not that different from Japan.
We get together with friends and party all night.
And then, when the day is dawning across the snowy fields, we turn towards it and say a prayer.
We pray to have another good year.
Maybe not, but… Am I really that different now?
Hihi… I'm sorry. Back then, I was just…
But even so… That greenhorn Lieutenant Ogami risked his life to save me.
Don't play it down, commander. I'm really grateful.
Hihi, I guess you're right.
Untranslated
Visiting the shrine at the side of a gentleman… This is a first for me.
Is it that strange?
What did you think I am, Mr. Ogami!
Oh no, those gentlemen never talk to me.
They don't talk to ME. They talk to the daughter of the Kanzaki conglomerate.
I'm sure you would look splendid in formal wear though.
You're a lieutenant, after all. You must at least have learnt ballroom dancing, right?
Just say the word, and it would be my pleasure to help you remember…
Hohoho, impossible! I could teach you all the secret techniques of ballroom dancing.
We should definitely give it a go sometime. As I said… whenever you want!
You're late, Lieutenant! Didn't you practice running in the Navy?
Ahaha… This feels so good I got carried away a little.
Come on! This little stroll is enough to make you huff and puff like you're about to die?
Pathetic… In Okinawa, the men aren't that weak.
Yeah, my old man was very strong, too. He'd never bitch and moan. Always training like a fiend.
Ha! But, as a woman I can't really brag about this. That's why I like strong men.
And I'm not talking about Karate and stuff.
A guy who doesn't give up, no matter what… That's real strength.
Hehe… You should do some exercising under Okinawa's scorching sun, too!
I just love the place! Every time I go back there, I forget about all my troubles.
I'd really like to take you there some day. That endless sky, the azure sea…
Uuuuncle Iiiichiiii! Come one, come ON!
Can I ask you something? What do people think when they see us like this?
That we're siblings? A couple? Or a girl who's being kidnapped by a stranger?
Hihi! Just kidding!
About that place we're going to… It's called a "shrine", right?
Hihihi, that's great! I have to tell Mama and Papa in a letter!
I wrote one just the other day. I told them of you, uncle Ichi.
How you kissed me!
How you told me you loved me.
Did I do something wrong? I'm not so much younger than Sakura!
Soon, you won't see me as a child anymore!
I'll be older than the other girls in no time!
Untranslated
It's all right! Trust me!
There was just a little problem with the engine back then.
It's a whole different beast now!
I improved it a lot, especially the suspension! Thanks to my special fuel, the engine is 2.5 times more powerful!
If I put wings on it, it'd probably take off!
This is the first run with human passengers though.
Don't worry! Just think about how lucky you are, boss!
You're the first guy who gets to ride behind me!
Other than certain individuals, I don't let just anyone near me!
All right! Here we fly!
Wa-wa-wait a second, boss! Where do you think you're holding on to!?
Stop it, stop it! Move your hands a little lower!
Eeek! Not THAT low! Higher, higher!
I gotta ask, boss… You didn't do that on purpose, did ya?
Well, all right.
Wow… So many people…
Everyone looks like they're having fun.
Ah, sorry. I'm not used to something like this…
Yes…
Hihihi… You're right.
Me? I'll wish for this peace to go on forever.
Thank you, commander. This was a lovely day.
I felt like I could forget about all those hard times for the first time.
Do you have anything planned for later?
I was wondering… Maybe you'd want to take a stroll to Yokohama with me?
A friend of mine has a cafe at the harbor. It's small, but…
I've been meaning to go there. But it would have felt stupid going there alone.
Yeah, that's true…
Thank you!
Guys…!
What are you all doing here?
