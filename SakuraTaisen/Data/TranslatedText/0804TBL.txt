﻿﻿It's a photo of Sakura. She's looking right at me. I wonder what she's thinking…
It's a photo of Sumire. This is a side of her you don't see too often.
It's a photo of Maria. …She's lost in thought and looks kind of sad…

A letter given to me by a customer. I was asked to give it to Sumire. I have a bad feeling about this…
Maria's pistol. This may help me escape from here…
A hair ornament. It's decorated with flowers and looks very elegant.
A pretty pendant. The delicate workmanship is gorgeous.
A hairpin for use in a traditional bun hairstyle. It would complement a formal outfit well.

I found this in a bedroom on the second floor. I can use it to access the back room.
A teacup Iris asked me to get for her. It has a very stylish design.
This is the matchbox Iris asked for. Its logo is quite colorful.

2nd January. Imperial City Daily Report. News Extra 
"A New Enemy Has Appeared". "Mass Chaos at Meiji Shrine" 
A hideous monster has appeared at Meiji Shrine. It was a desperate struggle for the Imperial Flower Division. 
The bizarre beast appeared at the crowded Shrine and caused mass hysteria in the area. 
The Troupe was dispatched, and victorious, yet seriously injured. Were the Spirit Armor and Koubu destroyed? 
It seems that the citizens of the imperial capital are unable to hide their shock at the appearance of a new demon. 
With all due respect… <br> It's my responsibility… 
With all due respect, Commander Yoneda. Their "Koubu" was no match for that enemy. 
Ogami! What the hell are you saying?! Aren't you the commanding officer of the Flower division!? 
Were you only taught to talk crap at military school?? 
… 
I'm sorry… It's my fault. I am fully prepared to receive the punishment I deserve. 
You bloody idiot! If you go off and kill yourself now, then it's all over!! 
And yet… the Koubu was totally destroyed! 
…I have no words. 
Geez… we're gonna have to go back without a single piece left of our precious Spirit Armor… 
I… I'm so ashamed…! 
The Hive of Darkness will come after the civilians next. They should beware these new threats… 
And because everyone's just hiding away in their houses now, the economy has totally broken down. 
The big shots up in government have been giving me nothing but grief about this since yesterday. 
No wonder my stomach is killing me. 
Are you sure that's not just because you drink too much… 
Did you just say something?? 
No, I didn't say anything! 
Better not have, Ogami! 
We can't just assume there'll be peace once the Hive of Darkness are defeated! 
If I see any more bad behavior out of you I'll be demoting you to full-time ticket collector! 
F…full-time ticket collector!? 
If you don't like it I suggest you hurry up and think of a counterattack against these monsters quick smart! 
Y-yes sir! 
If you got it then go already! 
Y-yes! Excuse me! 
…… 
Even so… if there are monsters like that still alive out there… 
The Kouma… 
Six years ago… Lt. General Yoneda and the Anti-Kouma Corps managed to seal away the Kouma in other bases… 
I wonder if Aoi Satan's hands have been resurrected in the city now… 
If the Koubu aren’t healed quickly… it will be real trouble for the Imperial City. 
Yes, just a minute… 
Chief… sorry for comin' in so late. 
…What's wrong, Kohran? 
…I uh, got somethin' I wanna talk to ya about. Mind if I… come in? 
…Alright. Come inside then. 
…Kohran? 
Kohran… what could she possibly want to talk to the Ensign about at this hour… 
…So then, Kohran. What on earth did you want to talk about? 
If I get right to the point… there isn't much chance of the Koubu gettin' repaired. 
What? 
I had a look at them, but the Koubu's spirit engines are totally busted. It'll be real difficult to fix… 
And frankly, even if I could fix them… they wouldn’t stand a chance against the enemy next time. 
…So we need a weapon other than the Koubu, you mean… 
Well, that ain't that easy either. The Imperial Assault Troupe sucks up loads of cash and makes nothin' back. 
Developin', maintainin' and improvin' the Spirit Armor… who knows how much all that will cost us. 
And now the Koubu are ruined… and to make matters worse, there ain't no money, 'cause of this new enemy. 
There's just no way we could make a new Koubu at this kinda time… 
What about a loan…? 
…Huh!? 
What's up, Chief? Ya look a bit scary… 
Sorry… did you hear something just then? 
Nope, I didn't hear nothin'. Maybe it was just ya imagination? 
Maybe… 
Chief… what are we gonna do? 
Go and talk to Yoneda. <br> Go and talk to Ayame. 
Chief, there ain't nothin' we can do about the Koubu thing now. 
We should talk to Yoneda and see if he can give us a hand somehow. 
Until then, should we gather everyone and see if we can't figure out somethin' together? 
Good idea. Get everyone to meet in the tactics room. 
Got it. 
Right… I'll go and talk to the higher ups. 
This isn't a problem I can solve on my own. I will discuss it with Yoneda. 
…Alright. I'll go and get everyone from the Flower Division together in the tactics room. 
Please do. 
OK… I should go to the manager's office. 
It's Ogami. I'd like to talk to you. 
Come in! 
Excuse me. 
Manager, please listen to me… 
This is about the Koubu, I guess? 
Yes, exactly. The Koubus' potential is exhausted, and our funds are limited… 
Can't you do anything about this? 
I've been wrecking my brains about this whole pickle… 
Can I ask you to leave the whole thing to me? 
Really? But… 
I have a plan that should solve our problems, but it'll take some time. So, Ogami… 
You do your job and put some spirit back in the Flower Division! 
Understood. See you later. 
The members of the Flower Division should be gathered in the command room by now. 
I can't solve this problem alone. I'll ask Ayame for help. 
…Alright. I'll go and get everyone from the Flower Division together in the tactics room. 
Please do. 
OK… I should go see Ayame. 
It's me, Ogami… Do you have a minute? 
Oh, Ogami? Come right in. How can I help you? 
I'm sorry to disturb you so late. To be honest, I need your help… 
…about the Koubu, yes? 
Yes… It pains me to say it, but I have no idea what we could do… 
Don't beat yourself up about it. This problem is just too big. 
Producing entirely new Spirit Armors… That would be a national effort. 
Yes… 
I'll have a word with Lieutenant General Yoneda about the Koubu. I think he had some kind of idea. 
But, Ogami… Please allow me one word of warning. 
Like I said before, the most important thing for a leader is to make a decision and stick with it. 
…Understood. 
…And another thing is to never make your team members worry. 
…! 
You can bet they all feel as uneasy as you about the loss of the Koubu. 
You need to act as positively as possible. 
If you can't keep it together, they'll only get all the more worried. 
I'm sure you can figure out the rest yourself. Good luck, Ogami. 
…All right. 
Everyone should be in the command room by now. 
Looks as though everyone's gathered. 
OK… So, should we start? 
Let's think about a strategy to fight those monsters… the Kouma. 
To start with, please let us hear your thoughts, Boss. 
What can we do to stand against those monsters? 
Go back to training. <br> Get more powerful weapons. 
We all need to go back to training. The Koubu are only as strong as their pilots. 
The Flower Division can only become stronger if each of its members grows stronger. 
Go back to our roots, you mean? 
In order to stand against the Kouma, we need more powerful weapons. 
That's a tough one, Chief… 
… 
Ah, yes… I asked Lieutenant General Yoneda for help with that problem. 
All right… It seems we have to come up with a different way. 
Captain… The fighting capabilities of the Spirit Armors grow in proportion with the abilities of their pilots. 
Even using the same Koubu as before, if we grow stronger, we'll be much more powerful in a battle. 
Chief! This is an important meeting, so how can you space out like that!? 
Yes, er… Sorry… 
Oh boy… Are we really out of ideas? 
…I've got a proposal. 
The fighting capabilities of the Spirit Armors grow in proportion with the abilities of their pilots. 
Even using the same Koubu as before, if we grow stronger, we'll be much more powerful in a battle. 
A return to our origins? Not bad. 
OK, then I'll return to the remote mountains where I practiced karate! 
And I'll ask my old sword fighting sensei for a refresher. 
OK! So, all of you… 
I'm not too keen on special training. 
Do we really HAVE to do that? 
…huh? 
I think it would be much better to build new Koubu! 
I agree. This is not an enemy we can fight empty-handed anyway. 
But don't you think the ones who've steeled their spirit will survive the longest? 
If that's what you believe, feel free to go live on your remote mountains… 
Maybe you'll become king of the jungle there! 
What did you say!? 
Settle down, you two! 
…What shall we do, Captain? 
Time for special training! <br> Leave it to their judgment. 
All right, it's time for some special training! 
I want each of you to go back to their original fields of expertise and try to rekindle that flame that we've lost. 
Right! 
OK! 
What about the others? 
…… 
…… 
I'll follow your orders… 
…And you, Kohran? 
Well… even special training isn't like flipping a switch to become stronger in a few days. 
Different strokes for different folks. That's true for mind and body. Right, Chief? 
Even if you think this is good for some of us, it might not be ideal for everyone. 
But… 
Besides, I'm busy with a new invention at the moment. 
All right, enough of this! If someone doesn't agree, I won't force them to do anything. 
It's obvious to all of you that we can't win against the Kouma as we are now. 
…OK. Just do whatever you like. 
Ogami? 
I'm sure everyone of us knows in their hearts what we have to do. 
Please do whatever you see fit… as long as it will help us fight the Kouma! 
…What is it, Captain? 
That's how it is… 
Kohran. 
Yeah? 
Contact the Flower Mansion's workshop and improve the Koubu as much as you can! 
Roger! 
I'll leave the rest to everyone's own decision. Do you agree, Captain? 
All right, then we'll do as we see fit. 
Yay, I can have lots of naps! 
…Thanks, Chief. 
Oh boy, maybe I'm out of practice? 
Hehe… Seems like I won this time. 
Not so fast, this isn't over! 
Hmm, we were so close… 
Wow, you bought a LOT of stuff! 
Hohoho… Next, I need a new dress! After that, we'll have some tea. 
And then… it's nappy time! 
I'll show you all! I know I'll do it… I'll show you I'm stronger than even my father! 
The way of the sword is the way of the heart. Your heart speaks through your sword… Fast and light…

What kind of moronic article did that idiot write? 
Hihihi… No need to freak out like that, Lieutenant General. 
It's just the right amount for this brainless moron still stuck in the holiday mood. Besides… 
"In prosperity, prepare for adversary." Even in times of peace, we can't let our guard down. 
In our last fight against the Hive, we didn't finish the job. 
This Aoi Satan… He may be even more dangerous than Tenkai. 
Hehe… Heeheeheeheeheeee! 
At last it's time for you to emerge to the surface. 
Kill everyone alive in this world… Drink their blood and eat their flesh… 
But first, we have to get rid of those pesky humans who stand in our way. 
A formidable foe awaits you… 
Hehe… Heeheeheeheeheeee!
