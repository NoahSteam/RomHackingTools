It's a photo of Sakura. She's looking right at me. I wonder what she's thinking...
It's a photo of Sumire. This is a side of her you don't see too often.
It's a photo of Maria. ...She's lost in thought and looks kind of sad...
A photo of Kanna. She looks strong and reliable. I can't wait to meet her.
A photo of Iris. She's surrounded by flowers and flashing a radiant smile.
A photo of Kohran. She looks good in her traditional outfit. What kind of person is she?
A letter given to me by a customer. I was asked to give it to Sumire. I have a bad feeling about this...
Maria's pistol. This may help me escape from here...
A hair ornament. It's decorated with flowers and looks very elegant.
A broach. It's a beautiful piece of delicate craftsmanship.
A hairpin for use in a traditional bun hairstyle. It would complement a formal outfit well.
Jean Paul the teddy bear. Iris's best friend. She always carries him with her and takes good care of him.
This key will allow me to enter rooms I couldn't get into before.
I found this in a bedroom on the second floor. Now I can get into the room at the back.
A teacup Iris asked me to get for her. It has a very stylish design.
A matchbox Iris asked me to get for her. The brand logo is very colorful.
A knife Iris asked me to get for her. Just a normal utensil you'd use during a meal.
A prop sword and shield used onstage. They're well made and look just like the real thing.
A prop crown used onstage. It's well constructed and incredibly detailed.
A wig and costume used onstage. I wonder what kind of act could use a flashy outfit like this?
A photo of Sakura in her swimsuit. Wow, this is really something. I'm gonna treasure this.
A photo of Sumire in her stage costume. Her distinctive makeup really makes an impact.
It's a photo of Maria on stage in the military uniform from "For Love"... She's a beautiful woman disguised as a man. 
A photo of Kanna in her training gear. Catching her in a private moment like this feels surprisingly intimate.
A photo of Iris in her swimsuit. She's holding a rubber ring and looks ready to have some fun. How cute.
A photo of Kohran. I don't get to see her with her braids undone very often. It's a nice look.
A photo of Ayame in a traditional outfit. I hope she'll always be as happy and content as she is here.
Ayame's gun. Why...? Why did it have to turn out like this...?
Nothing I can do here. I'd better check somewhere else...
There's no one here. I'd better check somewhere else...
I'd better check somewhere else...
I'm not making any progress here. Maybe I should go to the manager's office and talk to Lt Gen Yoneda.
The more I wander around this place, the less it seems like a theater...
Imperial Navy Ensign Ogami-san Ichiro:
(……It's already well into the night.)
(I'd like to go to sleep, but…… Maybe it's because I'm just not used to the bed, but I can't manage to fall asleep……)
(It's almost 12:00, huh……)
…………
(……! Who in the world could it be…… at this late an hour?)
Ogami…… It's Sakura……
Sakura? Just a second. I'll open up the door.
(What could it be, this late at night……?)
Hey, Sakura. How did the play go?
Yes, it was a huge success.
But more importantly…… I'm sorry about just now. I didn't mean to make so much noise……
No, no, it's all right. More importantly…… what is it, this latenat night?

Untranslated
Um, Ogami……
The truth is, I was instructed to have you make the nighttime rounds in the theater……
I was told so by Manager Yoneda……
Nighttime…… rounds?
Yes…… I'm terribly sorry for bringing it up so suddenly, but…… nPlease.
All right, I'll do it! <br> I guess there's nothing I can do about it. I'll do it. <br> ……I'm going to sleep.
……I'm going to sleep. After being put to work clipping tickets Incan't stand to be made to go on patrol too.
Ogami…… Are you really going to sleep?
All right. I'll do it. <br> Yea, I'm going to sleep.
Yes. I'm really going to sleep.
……I understand. If that's the way you're going to be, that's just fine with me. I'll make the rounds.
Ogami……
What happened to the Ogami who was so full of life when I first met him in Ueno Park?n
I…… don't want to look at you the way you are now!
Sakura………… I wonder if I was a little too stubborn……
……There's nothing I can do about it. I guess I'll go to sleep for today.
All right, I'll do it!
I was having trouble getting to sleep. This'll be just the exercise I need.
Thank goodness…… I'm so glad you're accepting this in such goodnspirit.
Well then, shall we go?

Not exactly. The Imperial Theater contains the headquarters of the Imperial Assault Force.

I'm still just a burden to everyone at the theater.
But I'm ready to put my life on the line to protect this city.

Come on, let's go! Lieutenant General Yoneda is waiting!
This is your first time here, isn't it? Let's enter through the front lobby.
Untranslated
Untranslated
Oooh! Sakura, is this your boyfriend?
Iris! You shouldn't tease grown-ups like that.
This is Ensign Ichiro Ogami. He's just transferred to the Imperial Assault Force.
I'm Iris. I'm in the Imperial Assault Force too, in the Flower Division.
And this bear here is Jean Paul. He's my very best friend, so you better be nice to him.

Well then, do you expect me to pick it up myself?
I'll have you know I'm the sole heir to Kanzaki Industry and the leading star of this theater! And furthermore...
The queen of Japanese high society, Sumire Kanzaki! Now pick up my fork from the floor!
How very dare you! You're fired! You'll be sent packing as soon as I've reported you to the director!
Oh! ...Oh dear me...Ohohohoho....
No wonder you made such a strange waiter...So terribly sorry.

My thanks. By the way, I happen to be Sumire Kanzaki, the top star of this theater.

Lieutenant General Yoneda is in the director's office. I have training now, so I'll be on my way...
I leave you with a bit of advice. Do not stare when you're talking to a woman! Now, if you'll excuse me!
Yesh, come on in.
Ah, I've heard about you from Count Hanakoji. Now, let'sh drop the formalities.
Thish here is the Imperial Theater. No need for all that military talk.

Thank you so much for today.
It's a good thing you were here, Ogami.
