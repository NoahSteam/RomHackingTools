Thank you for attending Tokyo Game Show, and welcome to Sakura Wars! 
We now present Sakura Wars, tonight's exclusive special program. 
Our curtain opens on the year Taisho 12. The season is spring, when cherry blossoms dance and scatter in the wind. 
The scene is Imperial Tokyo, where the adventurous spirit of a boom town floats through the air. And more... 
Horse-drawn carriages, steam engines, airplanes... Tokyo is the height of civilization, where East meets West. 
The hero of this tale is Ichiro Ogami. 
A young ensign in the Navy, made commander of the Flower Division, a secret corps of the Imperial Assault Force. 
The story begins as Ichiro Ogami... in other words, you... meets with a certain girl... 
Under the blooming cherry trees of Ueno Park. 
Now sit back, relax, and enjoy the tale of Sakura Wars. 
Well, here I am at Ueno Park...but is there really a secret corps member around here? 
Y-yes. I am Ogami... 
Um... Excuse me, but who are you? 
Wait, it's a... theater?! 
I'm on duty! <br> I'd like to know about you. 
I'm on duty! <br> Sorry, but I don't have time to see a play right now. 
First I'd like to know more about you. 
N-no... I just spaced out for a moment. 
Such a large building... 
This is the front lobby of the Imperial Theater. 
Since it's your first time here, I'll show you around the theater. 
You can choose what rooms to visit with the map on the next screen. 
Oh... that's right! The basement and second floor are being cleaned, so please be careful not to go in there. 
Huh? That sound... 
W-whoa! What was that racket?! 
U-um... 
Are you OK? <br> What's with that messy bike? 
...Are you OK? And, um...by the way, who are you? 
What's with that mess of a bike...? 
Ye- yes, ma'am. 
I-I apologize. 
Er... 
I'm Imperial Japanese Navy Ensign Ichiro Ogami. 
I'm... well, you could say I'm captain-in-training of the Imperial Assault Force. 
Ogami, Kohran is another member of our Imperial Assault Force Flower Division. 
She's a brilliant scientist from China, though as you've heard, she speaks in Kansai dialect for some reason. 
But...sometimes she causes explosions like the one just now, so please take care around her. 
Now, let's go see another room. 
Wow... So this is where the audience sits. 
The Imperial Opera Revue, Flower Division is the other face of the Imperial Combat Revue, Flower Division. 
Normally, we perform all kinds of shows on this stage. 
Today's show, "For Love," is special because it's a sequel to an earlier work. Please take a look. 
...I-I apologize. I picked an awkward scene to show you... 
Everyone makes mistakes. <br> You really goofed that one! 
Everyone makes mistakes. Don't sweat it, Sakura. 
...Oh, thank you. Ogami, you're... such a kind person. 
Now, let's head for the next room! I'll give you my best tour! 
Ahaha, you really goofed up that one! 
...Hmph! Yes, I know, I'm an idiot. 
Just go away and leave me alone! 
Hey, Sakura! H-hold on a minute! 
...Ogami... I'm so hopeless... 
T-that's not true at all! Look, you've all been trying your best... 
Do you mean it? Thank goodness... I-I'm not usually that much of a klutz! 
Now, let's move on to another room. 
So this is the shop. 
N-no... It's nothing, really... 
Tsubaki is our shop assistant. 
You can buy lots of different photographs here. 
It looks like there aren't any customers here yet. 
Ah... I'm... Imperial Navy Ensign Ichiro Ogami. 
Stare. <br> Introduce yourself. 
(Such beautiful blonde hair...I wonder where she's from.) 
Oh... N-no! 
Pleased to meet you. I'm looking forward to working together... 
Maria is the vice captain of the Imperial Combat Revue. 
She was born in Russia. She's a very calm and reliable person. 
W-what's your problem?! 
Ye- yes, ma'am... 
I'm Imperial Japanese Navy Ensign Ichiro Ogami. 
This is Kanna Kirishima. She's another member of the Flower Division. 
She's a karate master, which makes her a big help in battle. 
(Whoa! ...T-that outfit doesn't leave much to the imagination!) 
Why should I do that...? <br> All right. 
Why should I have to do such a thing...? I refuse! 
I'm Imperial Japanese Navy Ensign Ichiro Ogami. As of today, I've transferred to the Imperial Combat Revue. 
You can tell me I'm fired, but I'm not going anywhere without orders from Navy Headquarters. 
...! 
Certainly... Here you go. 
Why should I have to do such a thing...? I refuse! 
I'm Imperial Japanese Navy Ensign Ichiro Ogami. As of today, I've transferred to the Imperial Combat Revue. 
You can tell me I'm fired, but I'm not going anywhere without orders from Navy Headquarters. 
...! 
Her family runs the Kanzaki financial group. 
She may seem harsh, but she's really a nice person. 
(Ah... Someone's here!) 
Pleased to meet you as well. 
Kasumi and Yuri take care of the Imperial Theater's office work. 
You can ask them if you have any questions about the theater. 
This is the Imperial Assault Force director's office. It's Manager Yoneda's room. 
That's right. Let's move on to another room. 
Zzz... Zzz... 
...Sounds like he's asleep. 
Waking him up would be a bad idea, so let's go somewhere else. 
...Excuse me. 
I am Imperial Japanese Navy Ensign Ichiro Ogami. Today at 12:00, I was assigned to the Imperial Combat Revue... 
I have just reported for duty! 
Manager Yoneda is always drunk... 
But he's a wonderful person who truly understands our needs. 
What's this room? 
A long time ago, the night watchman used to sleep here... 
But now it's not really used for anything. 
..Huh? W-who are you? 
This is Ayame Fujieda, Deputy Commander of the Imperial Combat Revue. 
Th... the pleasure is all mine! 
Ayame is knowledgeable about lots of things... She's someone you can really count on. 
I suppose... she's the kind of person you like, Ogami? 
Yes, I like her. <br> I like you better, Sakura. 
Yes, I like her. An older woman...is someone I can look up to. 
Hmph. Is that so? Well, why don't you ask Ayame to show you around the theater, then? 
Hey! W-wait a minute, Sakura! 
I like you better, Sakura. 
D-do you really? 
Yes, of course. It's very kind of you to show me around like this. 
...Thank you so much. I'm... really glad to hear that. 
Well, Ogami... Shall we be going soon? 
I-I'm sorry. That was a strange thing to ask you... 
W-well then, why don't we go to another room? 
Whaaa?! W-why is there a child here?! 
Ah... I'm... Imperial Navy Ensign Ichiro Ogami. 
Iris is a fellow member of the Imperial Combat Revue. 
She may still be little, but they say her latent power is too much to measure. 
This is... oh, a dressing room. 
Everyone in the Flower Division comes here to relax. 
Sometimes we all meet in here to talk to each other... 
Now and then, a big fight breaks out... 
We have some fun wrap-up parties after plays here, too. 
Ogami, if you have time, feel free to make an appearance. 
Ogami! This is called the "wing." 
The actors wait their turn to go on stage here. 
Oh? 
When we're closed or don't have performances, we hold rehearsals. 
But sometimes things can get out of hand... 
Moving on... I'd like to show you one of our rehearsals. 
I-I'm sorry. How embarrassing to have shown you that... 
It was your fault, Sakura! <br> It was Sumire's fault! <br> What's going to happen now? 
It was your fault, Sakura! 
...You think so? It's true that I lost my cool... 
But Sumire had no business saying what she did! 
O-OK, OK. No point in fighting with me too, is there? 
Come on, let's check out another room. 
Sumire was at fault there. She shouldn't have talked to you like that. 
Y-you're right. 
But... now that I've calmed down, I think I went a little overboard too. 
As a member of the Imperial Combat Revue, maybe I should have shown more poise. 
What's going to happen now? I'm anxious to see the conclusion of this fight. 
Honestly, Ogami...You worry about the silliest things. 
You can look forward to the next part of the story in our original show. It comes out this fall! 
...Um, we don't fight like that all the time, you know. 
...I suppose I really shouldn't have made you watch that... 
......! 
W-what is this alarm?! 
Let's go, Ogami! The Imperial Combat Revue Flower Division is reporting for duty! 
What...is this... 
Ogami! The Imperial Combat Revue Flower Division is finally on call! 
...Huh? Kanna's taking her sweet time getting here. 
You're right... Where could she be? 
M-my bad! I'm running a little late! 
Kanna! I've told you time after time, you can't afford to be late! 
I-I'm really sorry. The time just flew by. 
Let me guess. You were so busy eating, you didn't hear the alarm. 
...Damn. You never know when to keep your mouth shut. 
Enough chatter, now... Lieutenant General Yoneda, please speak. 
Very well. Ogami, our enemy is an organization called "Hive of Darkness." 
...Hive of Darkness? 
They're a group that seeks to destroy the capital and restore the Tokugawa Shogunate. 
Their leader's name is Tenkai. He's a demon whose lifespan transcends time. 
And under Tenkai are the Four Lords of Death... 
They'll be... a tough opponent for the Flower Division. 
It's all right, Ogami. The Flower Division will never fall to this Hive of Darkness! 
You're here. We're all here. And...we have the Koubu! 
...Koubu? 
Come along, Ogami. I'll take you to the Koubu. 
Here it is...the secret weapon of the Flower Division! 
Now get going, Ogami! The white Koubu is yours! 
I'm leaving you in charge of the Flower Division on the battlefield! 
Yes, sir! 
All right...I'll finally be seeing some action! 
Ogami, give the order to attack! 
Flower Division, attack! <br> Time for the flower party! <br> ...uh, where are we fighting? 
Flower Division, attack! 
Roger! 
Hive of Darkness... 
We ain't scared of them! 
As long as we're around... 
We won't let them do anything bad! 
Let's go, Ogami!! We need to keep peace in the capital!! 
Flower Division, get ready for the flower viewing party! 
Drinks, check! 
Food, check! 
Mats, che... 
Hey, you! Quit messing around and get going! 
Y-yes, sir! 
...Huh? Where are we going to be fighting? 
...Not that you mention it, we haven't been told yet. 
O-oh dear, my apologies. It must have slipped my mind. 
A-Ayame... 
A-anyway, time to move out! Start up the Koubu! 
You're the captain, you fool! Don't just stand there twiddling your thumbs! 
It may be your first battle, but you still need to order the attack! 
Y-yes, sir! 
I-Imperial Combat Revue, attack! 
What did you think of the Sakura Wars special edition? 
Did you have a chance to learn more about the world of Sakura Wars? 
Well... this was just a little sneak peak! 
All kinds of drama awaits you in the full story of Sakura Wars! 
It's got friendship... 
Comedy... 
Action... 
And... romance! 
Amid the Taisho cherry blossoms... 
It's a storm of adventure! 
September 27 is coming soon... 
We finally get to be onstage! 
We'll be waiting for you! 
We look forward to seeing you again this fall! 
The director's office... Looks like Manager Yoneda isn't here. 
The door is locked, and everything seems fine. Let's continue the watch. 
...Manager Yoneda's probably getting hammered again. 
Ogami, I think we already came this way earlier. 
Now that we're out here, why don't we visit another room? 
...Um... Are you Ensign Ichiro Ogami? 
I'm Sakura Shinguji. 
Lieutenant General Yoneda has tasked me with being your escort.

About me...?

I'm still just a burden to everyone at the theater. 
But I'm ready to put my life on the line to protect this city.

Come on, let's go! Lieutenant General Yoneda is waiting! 
This is your first time here, isn't it? Let's enter through the front lobby.

Oooh! Sakura, is this your boyfriend? 
Iris! You shouldn't tease grown-ups like that. 
This is Ensign Ichiro Ogami. He's just transferred to the Imperial Assault Force. 
I'm Iris. I'm in the Imperial Assault Force too, in the Flower Division. 
And this bear here is Jean-Paul. He's my very best friend, so you better be nice to him.

I seem to have dropped my fork. I don't supposed you could pick it up and fetch me a new one? 
Well then, do you expect me to pick it up myself? 
I'll have you know I'm the sole heir to Kanzaki Industry and the leading star of this theater! And furthermore... 
The queen of Japanese high society, Sumire Kanzaki! Now pick up my fork from the floor! 
How dare you! You're fired! You'll be sent packing as soon as I've reported you to the director! 
Oh! ...Oh dear me... Ohohohoho.... 
No wonder you made such a strange waiter...So terribly sorry.

My thanks. By the way, I happen to be Sumire Kanzaki, the top star of this theater. 
Although somehow or other, Maria ended up as the leader of our opera troupe. What do you think of that?

Is there... something stuck to my face? 
Lieutenant General Yoneda is in the director's office. I have training now, so I'll be on my way... 
I leave you with a bit of advice. Do not stare when you're talking to a woman! Now, if you'll excuse me! 
Yesh, come on in. 
Ah, I've heard about you from Count Hanakoji. Now, let'sh drop the formalities. 
Thish here is the Imperial Theater. No need for all that military talk.

My name is Sakura Shinguji. I just arrived here from Sendai. I'm a new member of the Imperial Theater. 
Cough, cough...Um...This is the Imperial Theater, right? 
Cough...Awww...My steambike is totaled... 
The name's Kohran Li. Starting today, I've transferred from the Imperial Revue Hanayashiki Branch to Ginza Headquarters. 
Agh! My face is up here, y'know! 
My steam bike boasts 4 cylinders and 5 valves! It runs at 100 HP and 200km per hour! 
Does that sound like a mess to you?! You better watch yourself, buddy... 
Or I'm gonna knock your block off! 
As long as you get it, we're cool! I'm Kohran Li, scientific genius. 
I'll be living here from now on. Nice to meetcha! 
Anyways, who are you? 
Huh, I guess that makes you my boss... 
I humbly introduce myself as Kohran Li, just transferred from the Garden Branch to Ginza Headquarters! 
Whoa, you're the ensign?! You sure have got the look for it! Man, I like you!! 
Yo! 
Eh, no worries...I 'm Kanna Kirishima. Who're you? 
Thank you for your hard work. 
I'm Ayame Fujieda. I'm pleased to meet you, Ogami. 
A captain must be able to make judgments in an instant. I have high hopes for you. Good luck.
