﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿Hey everyone, let's do it! 
Victory pose… Yeah! 
I've got to focus! 
Here I go! 
Leave it to me!! 
Watch this, Ogami. 
I'm fine, I can still fight… 
Thank you! 
Keep it up, Ogami! 
I knew I could count on you! 
Kyaaa! 
Ngh, I'll show you next time! 
I'm sorry… Ogami… 
It's my turn in the spotlight. 
Hahaha! 
I'm off!! 
Today's performance is all for you! 
It'll take more than that to bring me down… 
Ensign, so you really do care for me… 
Come, Ensign, it's your move! 
I'll be watching you! 
Uwahhh!! 
I suppose I'll let you win for now! 
The captain needs me!! 
I'll have to take down the enemies myself! 
Where's my next target!? 
Whoever wants to die first, just step forward… 
I'll be relying on your orders, sir! 
I'm not finished yet!! Not yet!! 
!! 
Focus, sir! 
We'll make it out of this alive, sir! 
Ahhh… 
They're too strong!! I need to withdraw!! 
Forgive me, sir. I need to withdraw! 
I can fight too! 
Here I go! 
I'm super strong! 
I'll fight hard for Mon Frère!! 
Uh, some of these lights are flashing… 
You're the best, Mon Frère! 
Go get 'em Mon Frère! 
I'll be watching! 
Kyaaaa… 
Stupid… stars… 
Sorry, Mon Frère… 
Gonna go all out. 
Better not underestimate science~. 
Movin' out!! 
Check this out! 
I'm takin' too much damage here! 
Aww, you're the best! 
I'm rootin' for ya! 
Take 'em down, Chief! 
Uwahhh… 
Dangit… they got me… 
Sorry, Chief… 
All right! Let's do this!! 
Full power! Hiyaaaaa! 
Feast your eyes on the killer techniques of the Kirishima! 
Let's take 'em down, Ogami!! 
No problem! It's just a scratch!! 
Thanks! I owe you one! 
Get in there, Chief! 
Let's see what you can do! 
Uwahhh… 
Damn. Guess I still haven't trained enough… 
I've gotta keep fighting… for the captain. 
All right! 
We did it! 
We did it! 
Phew! 
Nice one! 
Woo! We did it!! 
Om khili khili vajra hum phat… Om khili khili vajra hum phat… Om khili khili vajra hum phat…
I can see the gates of the infernal realm! 
Hold it right there! 
The Imperial Assault Troupe has arrived! 
What…? 
All right, that's the last of the enemies. 
No, look at that!! 
Wh… What on earth? Look at the demonic energy pouring out of it! Is it some kind of monster!? 
I see… So these are the ones who defeated Satan… 
Who are you?! 
I am Tenkai! Leader of the glorious Hive of Darkness… The ultimate and absolute ruler of this empire! 
What!? 
Fools who dare to interfere with my ambitions… know your place!! 
You worms aren't fit to face me!! 
Kaaaaaahhhh!! 
I've done what I came to do… You peasants can dance with this plaything of mine! 
Dance for me, as you feel the flames of Hell licking your feet… Hahahaha! 
The enemy leader is over here! We need to focus our attacks there! 
Eliminate all the enemies. We need to get rid of them if we want to save Teito Tower. 
Hehe, well now, Ogami. Looks like Kohran has taken a shine to you… 
Th-That's not it at all… I just, I dunno, feel like really giving it my all when the Chief’s around… 
Having faith in each other is important. Focus your will and synchronize your attack with Kohran. 
I think everyone will be fine without my protection. 
I will protect you, Sakura! 
I'll always be there to protect you, Sumire. 
Let me watch your back for you, Maria. 
I'll always be there for you, Iris. 
Don't worry, Kohran! I'll protect you! 
Kanna! I've got your back! 
OK, let's defend Teito Tower! 
Wh-What!? 
Sir, this enemy is stronger than anything we've faced up to now. You should concentrate our formation on defense. 
We'll lose if we try to face it head-on. We need to get up on that steam stand and look for an opening! 
That voice… Who on earth is it? 
Here we go! Time for my first battle! 
Dammit! This thing's a monster!! 
!? This thing’s on a completely different level compared to the Hex Mechs we faced earlier! 
Impossible… I can't believe the damage it dealt me… 
No way! This thing's too strong! 
Man, no kidding, this thing is crazy strong! 
We've located the Shadow Hex Mech’s main body! The Soaring Whale is starting bombardment! Get out of the blast area! 
So that's it… If we eliminate the main body, the enemy should disperse. I leave the rest to you, Captain Ogami. 
R-Roger that. Everyone, focus your attacks on the main body! 
We did it! 
Of course, with me here, it was a given that we would win. 
Well done, Ogami. 
!? 
Oh no! 
I can't believe it… And this was my first battle too… 
Ensign Ogami… I think I may have overestimated you. 
!? What the heck? Why's it moving all strange like that…? 
What on earth!? Those movements are so strange… 
What's the matter!? It looks like it's heading somewhere. 
Ensign Ogami, the main body seems to be heading for Teito Tower. You need to destroy it before it gets there! 
What?! Curse you…! You think I'll let you get away with this?! 
This is bad! It's gonna blow itself up when it gets to Teito Tower!! We've gotta stop it!! 
Oh no! It's going to self-destruct when it reaches Teito Tower! We need to stop it before it gets there!! 
Ensign, you need to stop its movements somehow!! 
Dammit! Things aren't looking good… 
Ensign Ogami! Surround the enemy with allied units and halt their advance!  
Ensign Ogami! If you surround the enemy with our units, we can halt its movement! 
Right. Everyone! Surround the enemy with your Koubu and keep it from moving! 
Kohran and I can destroy the enemy cannon installations with our ranged attacks. 
Kohran and I can take down the cannons set up by the enemy from a distance. 
The enemy looks quite formidable. We should focus on defense and look for an opening. 
Let's focus our attacks on the Shadow’s main body. We should also periodically stop its movements with our units. 
All right, we did it! My first gold star!! 
Good! Let's keep this up! 
Ensign Ogami. The enemy's strength is incomparable to anything we've faced before. Focus on defensive tactics.
So basically, the mission's a failure if we let Teito Tower get destroyed? 
Curse you! Teito Tower can wait. Focus on crushing them!! 
.
Hey Chief, how should I be fightin'?
Hey, Chief. How should I be fighting? 
Head to the front line. <br> Use ranged attacks. <br> Just sit back and watch. 
You serious, Chief? Doesn't sound like you're considering my strengths at all. 
Listen up, I'm good at bombing groups of enemies from a distance. Try to keep that in mind! 
You got it! Nice one, Ogami! You got my strengths all figured out!
Good one, Chief! You've got my strengths all figured out! 
My attacks are best for spots where the enemy is bunching up!! 
Wh-What!? You want me to just sit and watch while everyone else is out there fighting for their lives? 
Hey, I'm in the Imperial Assault Troupe too, you know! No way can I just sit back and watch! 
I mean, yeah I'm good at distance attacks from the back line, but… 
Trust me, I'll shine when it comes to ranged attacks and attacking multiple targets! 
Oh come on… Don't you know? 
This is my first battle and all, I was hoping you'd give me a bit of advice or something… 
Well… I'm just gonna give it my all. You just do the same, got it, Chief? 
Wait, sir! It appears the enemy has had plenty of time to prepare for this battle. 
Wait a moment, Ensign! It looks like the enemy has already made preparations for battle here. 
These installations look like cannons. They'll aim at anything in sight. Destroy them to open the path forward. 
This is a “steam stand.” It can recover your durability. They're a beneficial spot to hold. 
I understand. OK everyone, let's move out!! 
Ogami, you skipped out on helping repair the stage today! 
Ogami, I noticed you didn't come to help repair the stage today! 
I assume you were too busy thinking about that lovely woman? 
Well, yeah… <br> Hey, that's not true. <br> I was thinking about you. 
Oh, I see! Well try not to get hit while you're daydreaming about her! 
… 
I see. Well, I trust you, Ogami. Let's focus and fight hard!! 
Ogami! Women are sensitive to those kinds of lies! 
Did you really need to lie? Just be honest next time! 
You're right, now's not the time for that kind of question. 
And… I believe in you, Ogami! Let's focus and fight hard!! 
Those are “rockets.” They were developed back in my country during the 10th century! 
Rockets…? You mean those flying bombs they talked about in Officer Academy!? 
That's right… But this is my first time seeing a real one. Better be careful, everyone!
