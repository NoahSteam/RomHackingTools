﻿﻿﻿﻿It's a photo of Sakura. She's looking right at me. I wonder what she's thinking… 
It's a photo of Sumire. This is a side of her you don't see too often. 
It's a photo of Maria. …She's lost in thought and looks kind of sad… 
It's a photo of Kanna. She looks strong and reliable. I can't wait to meet her. 
It's a photo of Iris. She's surrounded by flowers and flashing a radiant smile. 
It's a photo of Kohran. She looks good in her traditional outfit. What kind of person is she? 
A letter given to me by a patron. I was asked to give it to Sumire. I have a bad feeling about this… 
Maria's pistol. This may help me escape from here… 
A hair ornament. It's decorated with flowers and looks very elegant. 
A brooch. It's a beautiful piece of delicate craftsmanship. 
A hairpin for use in a traditional bun hairstyle. It would complement a formal outfit well. 
Jean-Paul the teddy bear. Iris's best friend. She always carries him with her and takes good care of him. 
This key will allow me to enter rooms I couldn't get into before. 
I found this in a bedroom on the second floor. Now I can get into the room at the back. 
A set of cups Iris asked me to get for her. They have a very stylish design. 
A matchbox Iris asked me to get for her. The brand logo is very colorful. 
Some knives Iris asked me to get for her. Just a normal utensil you'd use during a meal. 
A prop sword and shield used onstage. They're well-made and look just like the real thing. 
A prop crown used onstage. It's well-constructed and incredibly detailed. 
A wig and costume used onstage. I wonder what kind of act could use a flashy outfit like this? 
It's a photo of Sakura in her swimsuit. Wow, this is really something. I'm gonna treasure this. 
It's a photo of Sumire in her stage costume. Her distinctive makeup really makes an impact. 
It's a photo of Maria during a performance of "For Love." Even in a man's uniform, her beauty shines through. 
It's a photo of Kanna in her training gear. Catching her in a private moment like this feels surprisingly intimate. 
It's a photo of Iris in her swimsuit. She's holding a rubber ring and looks ready to have some fun. How cute. 
It's a photo of Kohran. I don't get to see her with her braids undone very often. It's a nice look. 
It's a photo of Ayame in a traditional outfit. I hope she'll always be as happy and content as she is here. 
Ayame's gun. Why…? Why did it have to turn out like this…? 
Nothing I can do here. I'd better check somewhere else… 
There's no one here. I'd better check somewhere else… 
I'd better check somewhere else… 
I'm not making any progress here. Maybe I should go to the director's office and talk to General Yoneda. 
The more I wander around this place, the more it seems like an ordinary theater… 
General Yoneda should know what's going on here. I'll go ask him to explain the situation to me. 
He's on the phone… 
Sounds like he finished his call. 
Please excuse me! Ogami, reporting in! 
Ah, good to see you, Ogami. That uniform looks good on you. 
How's your work going? Have you gotten the hang of punching tickets all right? 
Please explain my assignment. <br> Were you on the phone? 
Can you please explain my assignment? No one told me anything about taking tickets at a theater! 
And all of my squad members are women! One of them… I think her name was Iris… is just a little girl! 
I thought I was accepting the post as captain of a secret strike team. This is nothing like what I imagined! 
Commander, who were you speaking to just now? 
Count Hanakouji, as it happens. The man who recommended you for this position. 
He wanted to make sure you weren't shirking any of your new duties. 
I see. Actually, I have a question for you regarding that, Commander. 
Aww, don't look so glum, Ogami. Loosen up. How 'bout we have a drink or two, huh? 
(Is this guy really the Lt. General Ikki Yoneda I've heard about? He's drinking in the middle of the afternoon…) 
Whatcha think of the job? I thought punchin' tickets'd be right up yer alley. 
Give me a break! This job is nothing like the assignment I was told about! 
I'm supposed to be captain of this Imperial Assault Troop, right? What are my duties? 
Actually, before you answer that… This IS the Imperial Assault Troop, right? It looks like a regular theater! 
Hm? Ogami, I think you're misunderstanding something here… 
Take a good, long look at the plaque above my head. 
Imperial… Assault TROUPE…?! 
Whaaat?! Like a troupe of actors? This isn't a misprint or something, is it? 
Sorry m'boy, this is the real deal. 
I could have sworn the documents said I'd been assigned to a secret assault force. Did I read it wrong…? 
Well, the performances we put on here sure are an assault on the senses. Bah ha ha ha! 
And as for secret… Well, you didn't know a government-run theater like this existed before, did you? 
Gaaaah! I can't believe this! 
Ha ha ha! Take some time, let it all sink in. 
This is… How did this…? 
The top-secret squad is just a bunch of actors…? 
This is all way too bizarre. Am I dreaming? 
Ogami, are you all right? What are you doing out here? 
Oh, Sakura… 
You look so pale… I think you should take a break. 
Do you remember the way to your room? If you like…I could accompany you. 
Yes, please do. <br> Sorry, I want to be alone. 
That would be great. I'm so confused right now I barely know what I'm doing… 
Are you sure you're going to be all right? 
Maybe you'll feel better if you rest up a little. Let's get you back to your room. 
Thanks for the offer, but I'd prefer to be alone right now… 
All right, whatever you say… 
I have a performance to prepare for myself. If you'll excuse me… 
An assault on the senses, not on enemy troops, huh? 
That's fine for Sakura and the others. They're right at home on the stage. 
They all have their roles to play…parts only they can perform. But what about me? 
Does my being here help protect our nation's peace at all? 
… 
Ogami… 
… 
All right, let's go! I'll take you as far as your door. Right this way! 
Whoa! Hey, slow down a little. 
No time to dilly-dally. 
Thanks for the help. Sorry to make you worry about me. 
Oh, it was no trouble. Besides… 
Huh…? 
Oh, it's nothing, really. I-if you'll excuse me, I have a performance to prepare for… 
Would you like to come in? <br> OK, see you later. 
If you have some time, would you like to come in? There's something I'd like to discuss with you. 
…I'm very sorry. The performance is due to start any minute now. 
I really would like to spend some more time with you, but duty calls. 
Oh, I see. That's fine, I understand. 
Break a leg out there. And thanks again for coming this far with me. 
You're welcome! I'd better get going. 
…Yeah, I guess I should rest up a little. 
Ogami… 
Huh? Oh, Sakura. Did you need something? 
I… Well… 
Cheer up, Ogami! That gloomy expression you're wearing doesn't suit you at all. 
When I think back to the way you were when we first met, back at Ueno Park, that's the way I… 
Sorry, I've said too much. I should get going. 
No, I'm the one who should apologize. 
It's just… You have your roles to play here, parts only you can perform. 
But what about me? I don't feel like I'm doing anything to safeguard the capital. 
I was so happy when I got the news I was being transferred here. 
Being promoted to captain of my own squad, straight out of the academy… it was like a dream come true. 
It didn't even matter what my assignment was. I'd be satisfied with any post if it meant protecting the capital. 
I thought I was taking control of a crack assault force, so when I found an exclusively female theater troupe, well… 
Does my being here help protect our nation's peace at all? 
Ogami… You look so sad… 
You were so quiet when I called out to you before, too… 
Oh, I know! Since I'm here already, how about I come in and spend some more time with you? 
Thanks, Sakura. The place is a bit messy, but come on in. 
Make yourself at home. 
Oh, thank you. 
To tell you the truth, I've never been inside a man's room before. It makes me a little nervous… 
Well now… 
Oh, right. Thanks for seeing me back to my room. 
I'd better get going. I hope you'll feel better soon! 
…I'm sorry, Sakura. 
It's just… You have your roles to play here, parts only you can perform. 
But what about me? I don't feel like I'm doing anything to safeguard the capital.

… 
Ogami, please don't look so gloomy! 
What happened to that cheerful young man I met in Ueno Park earlier today? 
Sakura… 
…Excuse me. 
…I'm sorry, Sakura. 
It's just… You have your roles to play here, parts only you can perform. 
But what about me? I don't feel like I'm doing anything to safeguard the capital.

Ask about the theater <br> Ask Sakura about herself <br> Ask about the Troupe 
Sakura, what do you do here at the theater? 
The Troupe puts on a new show at the Imperial Theater every month. 
This month's performance is "The Eve of Lady Camellia", with Sumire in the lead role. 
We also put on court plays, musicals, sketch comedies, and various other sorts of performances. 
Wow…seems like a lot of fun. 
Onstage, we can dazzle the audience by leading them into a different world. 
It makes our work feel tremendously rewarding. 
… 
I'm sorry…just listen to me prattling on. 
No, it's all right. 
It lifts my spirits to hear you speak with such passion. 
Ogami… 
Huh?…Seems like someone's here. 
Tell me about yourself, Sakura. What's it like living here? 
About me, you say? To tell the truth, I'm still fairly new here, too. 
On performance days, I'm up on stage. Our play for this month is "The Eve of Lady Camellia", with Sumire in the lead role. 
On our days off… well, I do a lot of rehearsing. 
Aside from that, there's cleaning, laundry… and my sword training. 
Sword training? 
Yes. Before I came to the capital, I would practice at a dojo in Sendai. 
Actually, there was something of an uproar the day I first arrived here… 
Wow, so you can use a sword. Not bad for a young woman like you. 
Oh, no… it's not all that impressive. 
Huh? …Seems like someone's here. 
…Actually, there's something I'd like to ask you. 
Oh, of course. What is it? 
I was assigned the role of captain of a secret squad called the Imperial Assault Troop. 
… 
But this place is just a theater where the "Imperial Assault Troupe" holds performances… 
Sakura, tell me the truth. Does the "Imperial Assault Troop"… really exist? 
Well… 
Now, who could THAT be? 
Um, well…s-sorry. I'm pretty nervous, myself. 
N-no, I'm the one who should apologize. What a thing for me to say… 
But I'm relieved…you seem to be such a sincere man. 
Huh?… 
N-no, it's nothing. 
Now, who could THAT be? 
Come in, it's open. <br> Ogami's not here right now! 
Come in, it's open. 
Maria…what is it? 
Well, the play will be starting shortly… 
…and Sakura is nowhere to be found. Have you by chance seen her, Ensign? 
Oh! I completely forgot! 
S-Sakura… 
S-Sakura! Why are you in the Ensign's room? 
Um, well, you see… 
…No matter! Hurry on backstage! Unless you were intending to play hooky?! 
Y-yes ma'am! 
Well, please excuse me, Ogami. 
…Uh, yes? 
…Ensign. 
Y-yes? 
There's nothing wrong with idle talk, but it would be a problem if you disturb the order of the Flower Division. 
Ah…understood. I'll take care not to disturb you all. 
Then if you'll excuse me, the stage is calling. 
Undoubtedly, you all have your roles to play here…parts only you can perform. 
But what about me? I don't feel like I'm doing anything to safeguard the capital. 
I was so happy when I got the news I was being transferred here.

Does my being here help protect our nation's peace at all? 
Come in, it's open. 
Sumire…what is it? 
Ensign, terribly sorry to bother you while you're off-duty. 
Truthfully, the play I'm to star in - "The Eve of Lady Camellia" - is due to begin quite soon, but… 
…we've been waiting for Sakura to show up backstage. Would you happen to have seen her? 
Oh! I completely forgot! 
S-Sakura… 
S-Sakura? Why in heaven's name are you in the Ensign's room?! 
Um, well, you see… 
A-at any rate! Head backstage posthaste! Everyone is awaiting your arrival! 
U-understood! 
Well, please excuse me, Ogami. 
…Uh, yes? 
Ensign… 
…My my, so that's the sort of man you are. 
Sumire, it's not like that! 
Now if you'll pardon me, I've a performance to star in. 
Sumire!…Ah, she's gone. 
Undoubtedly, you all have your roles to play here…parts only you can perform. 
But what about me? I don't feel like I'm doing anything to safeguard the capital.

Come in, it's open. 
Oh, Iris…what is it? 
Um, so, the play's gonna start soon. 
Sakura didn't show up backstage, so we're all looking for her. Have you seen her, Mon Frère? 
Oh! I completely forgot! 
S-Sakura… 
Oh, you're here! Found you, Sakura! 
I'm so sorry! I'll come right away. 
Well, please excuse me, Ogami. 
…Uh, yes? 
Yaay! I found Sakura! 
Huh? But…why was she in your room, Mon Frère? 
Ehh?! W-well… 
…Mon Frère, what were you and Sakura doing together in here? 
I-it wasn't anything…we were just talking! 
Huuh? No fair! I wanna talk to you, too! 
OK, OK. Sorry, Iris. But don't you need to get back to the stage? 
…Oh, yeah! Then let's talk another time! Pinky promise, OK? 
The play's starting, so I better go. Bye-bye, Mon Frère! 
Phew…that was close. 
So Iris performs as well…I guess that would make her a child actress. 
Honestly, I'm envious. You all have your roles to play here… parts only you can perform. 
But what about me? I don't feel like I'm doing anything to safeguard the capital.

Sorry, but Ogami's not in at the moment! 
… 
That voice…that IS Ensign Ogami, isn't it? 
O-Ogami! What are you saying?! 
Pardon me, Ensign. I'm coming in. 
S-Sakura! Why are you in the Ensign's room? 
Um, well, you see… 
…No matter! Hurry on backstage! Unless you were intending to play hooky?! 
Y-yes ma'am! I'm so sorry! 
Well, please excuse me, Ogami. 
…Uh, yes? 
…Ensign. 
…Uh, yes? 
There's nothing wrong with idle talk, but it would be a problem if you disturb the order of the Flower Division. 
Ah…understood. I'll take care not to disturb you all. 
Pardon my intrusion, Ensign Ogami. If you'll excuse me, the stage is calling. 
Undoubtedly, you all have your roles to play here…parts only you can perform. 
But what about me? I don't feel like I'm doing anything to safeguard the capital.

Ohohoh! What an amusing jest. 
If the Ensign is out, then to whom am I speaking now? 
Uh… 
Quite a sense of humor you have, Ensign. I approve. 
I've come in search of Sakura, since she's yet to show up backstage… 
…but if you are not here, then I suppose I cannot ask for your help. I'll take my leave. 
… 
She's gone. 
Phew…saved by Sumire's sense of humor. 
Honestly! What a ridiculous way to hide from people! 
But… 
That WAS pretty funny, Ogami! I nearly burst out laughing. 
R-really? 
Ohhh heavens, quite a sense of humor you have, Ensign. I approve! 
Haha! How did you like my impression of Sumire? 
Ahahaha! <br> …What was THAT? 
Ahahaha! That was spot-on, Sakura! 
Really? Thanks! I was afraid it wouldn't hit the mark. 
Ogami! 
I hope you'll keep on smiling like this. 
That gloomy expression you had earlier doesn't suit you at all. 
Sakura… 
Well, I should get going. They need me onstage. 
I'll get out of your way, Ogami. Excuse me. 
…I'm sorry, Sakura. 
It's just… You have your roles to play here, parts only you can perform. 
But what about me? I don't feel like I'm doing anything to safeguard the capital.

…What was THAT? Was that really supposed to be Sumire? 
Uhh…no good, huh? Ohh, that was just pathetic… 
S-Sakura, there's no need to cry! 
Eheheh, just kidding. I'm no good at impressions, but my acting's not bad, right? 
Sheesh… you had me going for a second, there. 
Feeling a little better, Ogami? 
Huh? Sakura, were you trying to cheer me up? 
How did I do? Well, I should get going. They need me onstage. 
I'll get out of your way, Ogami. Excuse me. 
…I'm sorry, Sakura.

S-Sakura, there's no need to cry! 
Eheheh, just kidding. I'm no good at impressions, but my acting's not bad, right? 
Sheesh…you had me going for a second, there. 
Feeling a little better, Ogami? 
Huh?! 
Sakura, were you trying to cheer me up? 
How did I do? Well, I should get going. They need me onstage. 
I'll get out of your way, Ogami. Excuse me. 
Ogami… chin up, all right? 
Sakura… you were trying to cheer me up, weren't you? 
All this is fine for you. You have a role to play here. 
But what about me? I don't feel like I'm doing anything to safeguard the capital.

Huh…Mon Frère's not here? Guess I gotta look somewhere else. 
Aww, the play's starting soon…Sakura, where did you go? 
Phew… that was close. 
Honestly! What a ridiculous way to hide from people! 
But… 
That WAS pretty funny, Ogami! I nearly burst out laughing. 
R-really? Hahaha, I'm flattered… 
Feeling a little better, Ogami? 
Huh? Sakura, were you trying to cheer me up? 
How did I do? Well, I should get going. They need me onstage.

…He doesn't appear to be here. 
At any rate… where could Sakura be? 
…He's of no use, then. I shall search elsewhere. 
But really…where on earth could Sakura have wandered off to? 
…He's not here. Ohhh, the play's gonna start soon! 
… 
Seems like they left. 
Oh my goodness…I thought my heart was going to jump of of my chest! 
Seems like they were looking for you, Sakura. 
I'll bet they came looking for me since the play's starting soon. 
Well, I'll get out of your way now, Ogami. 
Sakura…you were trying to cheer me up, weren't you? 
All this is fine for you. You have a role to play here. 
And this is a part only you can perform. But…what about me?

It looks like this is Sumire's room. 
Ensign! The door is locked, which means you cannot simply enter as you please! 
(Sheesh… doesn't seem like she wants to talk.) 
Enough of your foolishness. Say something if you want my attention! 
Sumire! I need to speak with you! 
I'm terribly sorry, but I'm changing at the moment. 
…Not here, I guess. 
…Not here, I guess. 
Yes? Who's there? 
Um…it's Ogami. Do you have a minute? 
I'm right in the middle of changing. Could you wait just one moment, please? 
Gulp… she's changing? 
Open the door. 
…I can't wait any longer. I'm coming inside! 
E-Ensign! What DO you think you're doing?! 
S-sorry… I just got tired of waiting, so - 
I asked for just one moment, did I not?! 
How outrageous of you to simply barge into a lady's room! 
I'm sorry. I got impatient… 
Had you come in before I'd begun changing, that would be one thing. But… 
Enough of your excuses! Leave, right this instant! 
No way around it… I screwed that up. 
Forget it. I'll go somewhere else. 
Thank you for waiting, Ensign. 
Such impeccable patience is nothing less than I'd expect from a military officer. 
It was nothing, hahaha… 
By the way…did you have some need of me? 
Could you show me your room? <br> Ask about the Troop. <br> Give her the letter. 
Could you show me your room? <br> Ask about the Troop. 
Could you show me your room? I'd love to see what it's like in there. 
Most certainly not. 
Why, the very thought of allowing a man into my room so casually… 
Y-yeah, but - 
In any case, I refuse. Now, if you will excuse me, I've my own matters to attend to. 
Ah… she closed the door right in my face. 
Sumire, please. Can't you tell me more about the Imperial Assault Troop? 
…This again? You certainly are a persistent fellow, Ensign! 
I'm begging you! I can't have been sent here just to take tickets all day, right? 
Aren't I meant to be captain of the Imperial Assault Troop? 
Gracious me, what a pest you are! I am forbidden to speak of… 
…!! 
"Forbidden"? Did you say "forbidden"?! 
Sumire, what do you mean? What are you forbidden to speak of, and by whom?! 
…P-pardon me. There are some pressing matters I must attend to. 
I hate to leave after you took the time to come and see me, but I must bid you adieu for now. 
Ah, Sumire, wait! 
(Hmm…what was all that about?) 
Sumire, could you tell me about the Imperial Assault Troop? 
Imperial Assault Troop… 
By the look of it, this is just an ordinary theater. 
I have a hard time believing it's the HQ for a secret force. Sumire, won't you tell me what's really going on? 
Well… 
…Pardon me. There are some pressing matters I must attend to. 
I hate to leave after you took the time to come and see me, but I must bid you adieu for now. 
Ah, Sumire, wait! 
(She seemed awfully flustered… what's going on here?) 
While taking tickets earlier, I was entrusted this letter by someone calling himself a devoted fan. 
I figured I should pass it along to you. Here you are. 
Goodness! You went to such trouble for my sake? 
You have my deepest thanks, Ensign. 
Still, why would a member of a secret troop like this receive fan mail? 
Why, beauty such as mine can hardly be hidden away from the rest of the world. 
Wherever I go, I have fans. It's not especially surprising. 
I-I see… 
I've still some matters of my own to attend to, so I will take my leave. Thank you ever so, Ensign. 
…I guess that patron ought to be satisfied now. 
… 
…Ensign, you grew so silent all of the sudden. Whatever is the matter? 
Uh… sorry. I was trying to think of what to say. 
I'm a busy woman, you know. I simply haven't the time to stroll along at your pace. 
Now if you will excuse me, I shall take my leave! 
Ah…she shut the door in my face. 
This appears to be a salon where the troop members come to relax. 
Sumire was drinking tea out here earlier… 
…Seems there's no one here. Better head somewhere else. 
(Oh! Sumire is here.) 
Why, Ensign Ogata. What brings you here? 
…It's Ogami. 
Oh, pardon me. I know - I'll call you "Ensign" from now on, to simplify things. 
(This is one daring outfit, all right…) 
(It's a wonder it hasn't slipped right off her shoulders.) 
…Is something the matter, Ensign? Your eyes have been fixed upon my body for some time. 
(This is one daring outfit, all right…) 
(C-crap! My eyes are being drawn towards her chest!) 
(Then again, it's pretty hard NOT to look!) 
…Ensign, just where do your eyes keep wandering off to? 
(I'd better quit staring if I don't want to get chewed out again…) 
(Such silky, perfectly straight hair…) 
(What would you call this hair color?) 
(…Looking more closely, there appears to be a beauty mark beneath her eye.) 
(I think it's called a "tear mark". It's pretty alluring…) 
Ensign, you've been gazing at my face for some time now. 
Oh, I, uh… s-sorry. 
Not to worry. 
A man would have to be mad to not be captivated by my beauty. 
(I'd better stop staring like an idiot.) 
(…Looking more closely, there appears to be a beauty mark beneath her eye.) 
What is it, Ensign? Did you wish to speak with me? 
Drinking tea before a performance is the perfect way to dissolve tension. 
By the way, Ensign… what was it you needed? 
(Her hair is gathered back in a hairband.) 
(…I wonder what her hair would look like without it?) 
'Scuse me… 
…! 
E-Ensign! What on EARTH do you think you're doing, grabbing at a lady's hair?! 
I-I just wanted to see what your hair is like without the hairband… 
You'd have better luck were you to try such a thing with Iris's ribbon! 
And here I believed you to be rather mature…how frightfully rude! 
I'll be going! 
Guess I pushed Sumire too far… she really let me have it. 
…Oh well. I'd better go too. 
Ensign, do you really mean to leave in the middle of our conversation? 
Ask about the Troop. <br> Ask Sumire about herself. 
Ask about the Troop. <br> Ask Sumire about herself. <br> Hand her the letter. 
Sumire, could you tell me about the Imperial Assault Troop? 
Imperial Assault Troop… 
By the look of it, this is just an ordinary theater. 
I have a hard time believing it's the HQ for a secret force. Sumire, won't you tell me what's really going on? 
Well… 
I hope it's not too forward of me to say, but I'd love to know more about you… 
My my, Ensign… how unexpectedly straight to the point you are. 
As I mentioned before, I am the daughter of the Kanzaki family, which controls the Kanzaki Group. 
Originally, the only stage I stood upon was the stage of high society. 
But then Kanzaki Inc. became linked with this theater due to their efforts, and so I came to live here. 
Kanzaki Heavy Industries? Why would a theater collaborate with an industrial manufacturing company? 
Ah, w-well now… 
While taking tickets earlier, I was entrusted this letter by someone calling himself a devoted fan. 
I figured I should pass it along to you. Here you are. 
Goodness! You went to such trouble for my sake? 
You have my deepest thanks, Ensign. 
I had been wondering just what sort of man had been assigned to us… 
…but it puts me at ease to see how attentive you are. 
I-is that so… 
Hang on, there's something strange about this… 
Why would a member of a secret troop like this receive fan mail? 
Well, no matter where I go or what I do, I've no shortage of gentleman admirers. 
I-I see… 
Whatever is the matter? Has a cat got your tongue? Oh, I do despise an unreliable man. 
You would do well to straighten up your act, Ensign. 
Sumireee! …Oh, you're here too, Ogami? 
Sakura… 
Sumire, it's almost time for you to go on stage. Please come get ready. 
How good of you to come for me. I must drop by my room for a moment, then I'll be right there. 
By the way…may I pose a question to you, Ensign? 
Eh, to me? 
Yes. Between myself and Sakura, what sort of woman do you prefer? 
…! 
Won't you tell me, Ensign? 
Girls like Sumire. <br> Girls like Sakura. 
I suppose…Sumire is my type. 
…Hmph. 
Ohohoho! Naturally. You have excellent taste, Ensign. 
…I'll be going. 
Oh, Sakura… 
I don't want to hear it! 
My, that was rather harsh of her… 
Well, I shall take my leave now, Ensign. 
I guess I offended Sakura… 
I suppose… Sakura is my type. 
What was that?! Ensign, you simply have no eye for the finer things! 
How very distasteful! I will be going, now! 
Ah, Sumire! 
Ogami, I need to go after her…please excuse me. 
I really shouldn't have said anything with both of them there… 
Oh! …Sakura… 
Ogami… 
What you said… it made me happy. 
Well, see you later, then… 
Sakura… 
What sort of woman I prefer…well… 
…Ugh, what an indecisive man you are, Ensign! 
Sumire, don't be like that. You're putting him in an awkward position. 
I would hardly think there is any room for debate on the matter… 
I will let it slide for now, I suppose. Well, I must be off. 
I should go too. See you later, Ogami. 
Yeah, sure. 
Ogami… 
I'm kind of relieved, but also a bit disappointed… what a complicated feeling this is. 
…Well, I should get going. 
Sakura… 
…Ensign. Just where are your eyes wandering off while I'm speaking to you? 
…Ensign. Just where are your eyes wandering off while I'm speaking to you? 
Ensign, you've been restlessly fidgeting during this entire conversation! 
Oh, I-I'm sorry… 
Good heavens…I can scarcely believe you'd wish to look away when I'm standing right before you. 
…Ensign. Just where are your eyes wandering off while I'm speaking to you? 
All right, time to head for the director's office. 
This must be the secretary's office. 
The pleasure's all mine. 
If you wouldn't mind, please fill out these forms for me. 
No problem. Let's see…will this do? 
Yes, that's fine. Thanks very much. 
Director Yoneda is in his office, right next door. 
Thank you. 
(Ah…Someone's here!) 
The pleasure's all mine. 
It's nice to meet you. I look forward to working with you. 
(This is the secretary's office. Yuri and Kasumi are here.) 
I came by to see you. <br> There's no particular reason. 
Actually, I did come by to see you. There's a few things I wanted to ask about… 
Y-yes, but I wasn't… 
There's no particular reason. 
I-it's not that I DON'T want to see you or anything… 
Ah…well, I just… 
N-no, it's…I just meant… 
(Yuri and Kasumi are here.) 
I'll come by again later. Keep up the good work. 
I'll come by again later. Keep up the good work. 
I'll come by again later. Keep up the good work. 
By the way, Ogami… 
The stairway to the basement is off-limits, by order of Director Yoneda. 
Please take care that you don't wander into the basement, Ogami. 
There won't be any performances tomorrow. It's so nice to have a day off. 
Ogami, I'm quite knowledgeable about this theater. 
If you ever run into a problem, feel free to ask me! 
Sumire spends a lot of time in the upstairs lounge. 
By the way, you heard about that mysterious girl who defeated a monster in Ueno Park a while back, right? 
You know, that was actually - 
Yuri! 
Oh… so-rry! 
Ogami, go ahead and forget what I just said! 
Hm…? 
Maria is an avid book reader! 
Seems like she's in the library every night picking out books to read. 
Iris is just the cutest thing! She reminds me of a little doll. 
But you know… she's rumored to be the daughter of a very rich family. 
The Flower Division has 6 members in total. 
Huh? But I've only met 4 members so far. 
The other two aren't here right now. Their names are Kanna and Kohran. 
They'll be returning to the theater before too long. 
All right, I'm going to ask Commander Yoneda more about my position. 
Whoa! You startled me…W-who might you be? 
Of course. <br> I'm a little busy… 
Of course. 
I'm a little busy at the moment…could it wait until later? 
I-I understand. 
Y-yes, sorry. I just blanked out for a moment… 
(Someone's coming up behind me…) 
Whooaa! Wh-who's covering my eyes?! 
Sumire? <br> Sakura? <br> Maria? 
That voice…is that Sumire? 
Nope! 
Oh… it was you, Sakura. You sure startled me. 
Hehe… I'm a little disappointed though, Ogami. 
I thought you would've remembered my voice by now… 
I'm… I'm sorry. 
Oh, it's fine. Just try to remember it from here on. 
Well, I should get going. 
Ah - Sakura, hold on! There's something I wanted to ask you. 
What is it? 
That voice… is that you, Sakura? 
Hehe… you got me. 
…So it was you. Boy, you sure startled me. 
Even you have a mischievous side then, huh? 
Hehe… sorry about that. 
But…it makes me so happy that you remembered my voice. 
Huh?… 
Uh…s-sorry. I guess that was a strange thing to say. 
W-well, I should get going… 
Ah - Sakura, hold on! There's something I wanted to ask you. 
What is it? 
That voice…is that Maria? 
…Wrong. 
…Oh, it was you, Sakura. 
How could you mistake my voice for Maria's? We sound completely different! 
We've spent all this time together, and you can't even remember my voice? 
S-Sakura… 
I'll be going! Pardon me for saying such an odd thing. 
Ah…looks like I offended her. 
Oh well. I'd better go. 
Huh? …Um, uh… 
Come on…you really don't know, Ogami? 
Oh, it was you, Sakura? You sure startled me. 
Sorry… you came up behind me so suddenly, I didn't have time to think. 
No, it's all right. I should be apologizing to you. 
I mean… it does seem very like you to be startled by someone's touch. 
Huh?… 
Uh… I-I'm sorry. What a strange thing for me to say… 
W-well, I should get going… 
Ah - Sakura, hold on! There's something I wanted to ask you. 
What is it? 
Tell me about the Troop! <br> Where are you headed? <br> …Do you have a boyfriend? 
Sakura, could you please tell me about the Imperial Assault Troop? 
…! 
This place is just an ordinary theater. Where exactly is the secret squad, the Assault Troop, supposed to be?! 
W-well, uh… 
I'm sorry…I need to find Sumire. Please excuse me. 
Sakura, wait! 
…There she goes. 
Why do I get the feeling… she was running from me? 
I'd better check somewhere else… 
Where are you headed, Sakura? 
The performance is due to begin soon, so I'm looking for Sumire. 
I'm willing to bet she's somewhere on the second floor… well, I'll be going. 
…Shoot, I forgot to ask her about the Imperial Assault Troop. 
…Oh well. I'd better go too. 
Where are you headed, Sakura? 
Me? Rehearsal is about to begin, so I need to get going. 
Well, I'll be on my way! 
…Rehearsal? Rehearsal for what? 
…Oh well. I'd better go too. 
U-uh… Sakura, do you have a boyfriend? 
Huh!? 
Ogami… 
No, I don't. But… 
… 
S-sorry, I need to go. 
Ah, Sakura… did I do something wrong? Maybe that was a strange thing to ask. 
Guess I'll go somewhere else… 
Uh, never mind. 
You're an odd one, Ogami. Well, I'll be on my way! 
…I never did ask her anything. 
…Oh well. I'd better go too. 
Well, keep up the good work. 
Well, keep up the good work. 
I'd better check somewhere else… 
You'd like to buy a photo? Thank you! 
Oh, are you done? 
Ah, Ogami! The photos are extremely popular items - they always sell out right away. 
For that reason, I'm afraid I can only sell you one at a time. My apologies. 
Hmm…by the way, just whose photo is this? 
Wh-what the - ?! 
(Why are photos of a secret combat squad… being sold to the public?!) 
(Wouldn't this reveal their true identities?!) 
Ogami, what's the matter? 
Uh, n-nothing. 
(I suppose I could buy one for now.) 
Ogami, I appreciate your interest, but… 
…since the photos are meant for our patrons, I'm afraid I can only sell you one at a time. 
I'll have more stock by next month, so please wait until then. 
…I understand. 
That's a photo of Sakura. That'll be 50 zeni. 
You'd like to buy that? Thank you! 
Sakura may be new, but her photos are selling like hotcakes! 
(Sure enough, that's Sakura…Is it really OK to be selling photos of a secret combat squad like this?) 
(But, it IS a cute photo…I guess I'll take it.) 
That's a photo of Sumire. That'll be 50 zeni. 
You'd like to buy that? Thank you! 
Her family runs the Kanzaki Group. 
Meaning, she's a big name in high society, too! How incredible! 
(That's Sumire, all right…Is it really OK to be selling photos of a secret combat squad like this?) 
(But I guess I could get it, since I'm already here.) 
That's a photo of Maria. That'll be 50 zeni. 
You'd like to buy that? Thank you! 
Maria is from Russia, but I've heard her mother is Japanese. 
She's got that stoic aura about her, and gorgeous blond hair. Wish I was that cool… 
(Th-there's even a photo of Maria? Is it really OK to be selling photos of a secret combat squad like this?) 
(Well, I guess I could get it since I'm already here.) 
That's a photo of Kohran Li. That'll be 50 zeni. 
Kohran… Li? Is she Chinese? 
Yes, she was born in China. She's a brilliant scientist. 
You'd like to buy that? Thank you! 
Kohran's always joking around. She's so funny! 
I believe she's at the Hanayashiki branch in Asakusa right now. 
(Hmm… she's wearing a Chinese dress.) 
(Guess I could get it for now.) 
That's a photo of Kanna Kirishima. That'll be 50 zeni. 
Kanna… Kirishima? 
She's very popular with children. Right now, she's in her hometown in Okinawa. 
Hmm… 
You'd like to buy that? Thank you! 
Kanna is an expert in the art of karate. Plus, she's got an amazing figure! 
I hear she went back home to Okinawa to continue her karate training. 
(I can tell she must be strong from the photo alone.) 
(Guess I could get it for now.) 
That's a photo of Iris. That'll be 50 zeni. 
You'd like to buy that? Thank you! 
Apparently, Iris is the daughter of a very wealthy French family. 
I hear she came to Japan after being scouted from France. 
(Th-there's even a photo of Iris? Is it really OK to be selling photos of a secret combat squad like this?) 
(Still…I already paid for it, so I may as well take it.) 
(A shopkeeper's outfit. Tsubaki looks good in it.) 
H-hey, Ogami! Where do you think you're looking? Stop! 
Ogami… come on, don't stare at me like that. It's embarrassing. 
(I know. Maybe if I ask casually, I can weasel the truth about this place out of her.) 
Tsubaki, could I ask you about this theater? 
Oh? If you want to know something about the theater, then I'm the girl to ask! 
Its official title is the Grand Imperial Theater, but most people just call it the Imperial Theater for short. 
We put on a different kind of performance each month! This month is a play called "The Eve of Lady Camellia". 
My name means "camellia", so hearing it like that makes me kind of happy! 
(That's not exactly what I wanted to ask about…) 
Um, Tsubaki… 
Ogami! Since you're here, why not buy a photo? 
S-sure… 
I'll have some new photos in stock next month, so I hope you'll be all right with just the one for now. 
Hey, Iris. Do you know where everyone else went? 
Sumire is upstairs. Sakura went to go get her. 
Maria said she was going to the stage. 
I see. Thanks. 
(Oh, Iris is here.) 
… 
(…Is she angry with me for what happened earlier?) 
… 
Mon Frère, sorry about before… 
…'cause it's not good to "eavesdrop". 
Iris…… 
Maria scolded me earlier. 
Mon Frère…please don't hate me. 
Don't worry. I wouldn't hate you because of something like that. 
You mean it? OK, then let's make up! 
By the way, Iris…there's something I wanted to ask. 
Yeeess? 
(Oh, Iris is here.) 
Oh, it's you, Mon Frère. Do you need something? 
Actually, yeah. There's something I wanted to ask you about real quick. 
Yeeess? 
(Oh, Iris is here.) 
Oh, Mon Frère! I had a lot of fun earlier! 
Yeah. Thanks for before, Iris. 
By the way…there's something I wanted to ask you. 
Yeeess? 
(Oh, Iris is here.) 
Oh, it's you, Mon Frère. Do you need something? 
Actually, yeah. There's something I wanted to ask you about real quick. 
Yeeess? 
Ask about the Troop. <br> Ask Iris about herself. 
I was wondering if you could tell me about the Imperial Assault Troop… 
Sure, OK. 
Why is the troop headquartered in a theater? 
We're in a theater, because that's where the "troop" performs. 
Isn't that obvious? You're pretty strange, Mon Frère. 
…? 
(I don't get it. There's nothing obvious about it!) 
I'd like to know more about you, Iris. 
About me? OK! Eheheh, gosh, you're making me blush… 
So, I used to live in France. 
I was recruited and came to Japan, and now I live here. 
I hadn't realized… 
Thank you for sharing that with me, Iris. Now I know a little more about you. 
Uh-huh! Next time, you should tell me something about yourself, Mon Frère! 
What is it, Mon Frère? Didn't you want to ask me something? 
Huh?… Oh, sorry. I blanked out for a second. 
You're acting so odd. Are you OK? 
(What adorable clothes. She looks like a doll.) 
Doesn't this dress look good on me? I have lots of fancy clothes. 
(What adorable clothes. She looks like a doll.) 
Mon Frère, do you remember my bear's name? 
Jean Pierre? <br> Jumper? <br> Jean-Paul? 
Umm… it's Jean Pierre, right? 
Noo! It's Jean-Paul! Jean-Paul! 
S-sorry. I forgot. 
…You better remember. He's my very best friend. 
He's a bear, not a sweater! And his name is Jean-Paul! 
S-sorry. I forgot. 
…You better remember. He's my very best friend. 
I remember. It's Jean-Paul, isn't it? 
Yaay! Mon Frère, you really remembered! 
Of course. He's your very best friend. 
Thank you, Mon Frère…I'm so happy you remembered. 
Erm…sorry. I forgot… 
You forgot? He's Jean-Paul the bear. 
Make sure you remember his name, OK, Mon Frère? 
You got it. 
Hey, Jean-Paul. Mon Frère here is our new friend. 
(That's an enormous ribbon…but it looks great on her.) 
Isn't this ribbon sooo cute? It's my favorite! 
(She has beautiful blond hair.) 
You know, tying up this ribbon all nice is hard. 
(Such pretty blue eyes…) 
Mon Frère… if you keep looking into my eyes like that, I'm gonna get embarrassed… 
(Such pretty blue eyes…) 
Do you know where everyone else is? 
Sumire is upstairs. Sakura went to go get her. 
Maria said she was going to the stage. 
I think Mr. Yoneda is in his room? 
I see. Thanks. 
I'm waiting here for everybody else. 
Bye, Iris. 
Bye-bye, Mon Frère! 
Mon Frère, what are you looking at? You should talk to me! 
Mon Frère, what are you looking at? You should talk to me! 
Mon Frère, what are you looking at? Are you bored of talking to me?! 
Mon Frère, what are you looking at? You should talk to me! 
This is… a library? Huh…it sure is cozy. 
…Seems there's no one here. Better head somewhere else. 
The library. Maybe I should drop by at night and see what sort of books they have here. 
…Seems there's no one here. Better head somewhere else. 
The library. Maybe I should drop by at night and see what sort of books they have here. 
…Seems there's no one here. Better head somewhere else. 
This is… a library? Huh…it sure is cozy. 
Sumireee…oh, Ogami. 
Hey, Sakura. Did you find Sumire? 
No, not yet…Where on earth could she be? 
Well, I need to hurry. Please excuse me, Ogami. 
Looks like Sakura's having a hard time, too… 
Hey, Sakura. Are you looking for Sumire? 
Yes, I am… Where on earth could she be? 
Well, I need to hurry. Please excuse me, Ogami. 
Looks like Sakura's having a hard time, too… 
I'd better check somewhere else… 
Hi, Maria. 
You appear to have a considerable amount of free time, don't you, Ensign. 
As I mentioned before, the stage is currently off-limits. Your cooperation is appreciated. 
Oh well. Guess I'll head somewhere else. 
It's Maria, right? What are you doing here? 
I could ask the same of you. What business do you have here? 
(She looks about as tall as me.) 
(Her clothes are so prim and proper… her demeanor too, for that matter.) 
(Her hair color is lovely. Platinum blond, I think it's called?) 
…Is there something stuck in my hair? 
(She got angry when I stared at her earlier…) 
Ensign, I believe I previously instructed you not to leer at people. 
(Her face shows a dignified, guarded expression…) 
Ensign, do you need me for something? 
(Her eyes are keen…I get the sense that she can see right through me with a single gaze.) 
Ensign, I believe I previously instructed you not to leer at people. 
Ensign, do you need me for something? 
…Did you need something from me? 
Tell me about the Troop. <br> Tell me about yourself, Maria. 
Maria, tell me something. I was assigned here as the captain of a secret combat squad. 
…Yes. I heard as much from Director Yoneda. 
But the only duty I've been given is that of a ticket puncher. What's the meaning of this? 
Please tell me…what is my true role in the Imperial Assault Troop?! 
…Forgive me, but I do not have the authority to answer that question. 
You had best ask Director Yoneda directly regarding that matter. 
Maria… 
Maria, would you tell me a little about yourself? 
What…? 
As captain of the Imperial Assault Troop, I'd like to know how a woman such as yourself came to be here. 
…I don't believe there's any need for me to answer that. 
In any case, I hardly acknowledge you to be the captain as it is. 
E-excuse me?! 
Ensign, you're interfering with my duties. Please refrain from speaking with me. 
If you have no business with me, I must ask you to take yourself elsewhere. 
The play is about to begin, so this area is off-limits. Please keep your distance, Ensign. 
The stage, prop room, and large prop room are all off-limits. Take care not to enter. 
G-got it. 
The play is about to begin, so this area is off-limits. Please keep your distance, Ensign. 
The stage, prop room, and large prop room are all off-limits. Take care not to enter. 
(It's hard to tell through her clothes, but… that's a fine-looking chest.) 
Just what are you looking at, Ensign? 
N-nothing… 
I had heard that you were an excellent soldier… 
…but by the way you act, I'd say you still have a long way to go. 
(If I keep staring, I'll just make her angry again.) 
Oh well. Guess I'll head somewhere else. 
The play is about to begin, so this area is off-limits. Please keep your distance, Ensign. 
Oh well. Guess I'll head somewhere else. 
Ensign, you ought to look someone in the eye when you're speaking to them. 
Ensign, you ought to look someone in the eye when you're speaking to them. 
You'd do well to compose yourself a little more while conversing with someone, Ensign. 
Ensign, you ought to look someone in the eye when you're speaking to them. 
What's with this room? There's a futon or something laid out. 
Oh, this must be the night watchman's room. We had one in the navy, too. 
This looks like a night watchman's room. Whoever is on night watch duty stands guard from here. 
There's so many outfits… this must be the wardrobe room. 
Could these be disguises for a secret squadron? …No. These are just costumes, no matter how I look at them. 
The wardrobe room. All the clothes here are for women. 
So this is the dining hall… I suppose it's normally for the patrons' use. 
The dining hall. 
Is this the kitchen? Looks like one you’d find in a restaurant. 
The kitchen. There's an irresistible smell coming from the soup simmering on the stove. 
This is the lobby. I was taking tickets here a little while ago. 
It's the theater's entryway. A steady stream of patrons is flooding inside. 
So this is the theater's auditorium…what a magnificent structure! 
The auditorium. Patrons are beginning to trickle in. 
This is the second-floor hallway. There's a fair amount of patrons here, too. 
Wow… this theater has two floors' worth of audience seating? 
You can see the entire stage from here. These are some really great seats. 
These are the second-floor audience seats. What a fantastic view! 
Wow, this is spacious. It's even got a desk. This is a pretty nice room. 
So this is my room from today forward…but I've still gotta take tickets at the theater's front desk. 
I'd love to kick back and relax, but that's not gonna happen right now. 
Wonder whose room this is… 
It's the mystery room. 
…No reply. Seems there's no one inside. 
Looks like this is Sakura's room. 
This is Sakura's room. Doesn't seem like anyone is here. 
…Not here, I guess. 
Looks like this is Maria's room. 
This is Maria's room. Doesn't seem like anyone is here. 
…Not here, I guess. 
Looks like this is Iris's room. 
This is Iris's room. Doesn't seem like anyone is here. 
…Not here, I guess. 
Wonder whose room this is… 
It's the mystery room. 
…No reply. Seems there's no one inside. 
Wonder whose room this is… 
It's the mystery room. 
…No reply. Seems there's no one inside. 
What beautiful weather. Looking out from here, the capital's springtime scenery appears quite tranquil. 
… 
The weather looks great today.

Ah, Ogami, welcome! What can I do for you? 
I hope I was able to be of service. Thank you very much for coming by! 
Unused
Ah, hello?… Yes yes, hello. 
Yes, he's here… just a little while ago. Well, I'm going to wait a bit longer, see how things shake out… 
But you know, Hanakoji…the matter of this secret corps is a tough pill to swallow. 
We force girls onto the battlefield, while all we do is sit back and watch. Frankly… it's humiliating. 
And yet, right now they are the only ones who can operate the Koubu. 
That's why I'm making it a point to protect these girls, while giving them as much freedom as possible. 
If only we could make use of that young one… 
Oho, looks as though he's come by to complain. Well, goodbye for now… 
Ah, good morning. You're Ogami, right? I'm Yuri Sakakibara! 
I do the theater's office work. I'm looking forward to working with you! 
Oh my, did you come by to see me? Hee hee, only teasing you! 
Do you need me for anything? 
Unused
It's nice to meet you, Ogami. I'm Kasumi Fujii. 
I'm the theater's office work manager. 
Do you need something? 
Good work today.

Come again! 
Ohh goshhh, I was only joking! 
Hee hee. Thanks, Ogami. 
Oh, OK then. I got it! 
Hee hee. You're a hoot, Ogami! 
Seriously, don't give it another thought. 
It's fine, Ogami. Don't worry yourself over it. 
Nice to meet you. You're Ogami, right? I'm Kasumi Fujii, the theater's office manager. 
I'm sorry to impose, but would you mind coming with me to the secretary's office to fill out some new-hire forms? 
I'm afraid it's regulation, but it shouldn't take too long. I hope you understand. 
Um… did you hear me, Ogami? 
Then I'll guide you there. This way, please.
