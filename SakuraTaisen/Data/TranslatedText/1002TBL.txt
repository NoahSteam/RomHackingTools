﻿﻿﻿﻿It's a photo of Sakura. She's looking right at me. I wonder what she's thinking…
It's a photo of Sumire. This is a side of her you don't see too often.
It's a photo of Maria. …She's lost in thought and looks kind of sad…
A photo of Kanna. Her signature strength comes through clearly.
A photo of Iris. She's surrounded by flowers and flashing a radiant smile.
A photo of Kohran. She's looking pretty in profile with her face dyed red by the evening sun.
A letter given to me by a customer. I was asked to give it to Sumire. I have a bad feeling about this…
Maria's pistol. This may help me escape from here…
A hair ornament. It's decorated with flowers and looks very elegant.
A pretty pendant. The delicate workmanship is gorgeous.
A hairpin for use in a traditional bun hairstyle. It would complement a formal outfit well.
This key will let me enter rooms I couldn't before.
I found this in a bedroom on the second floor. I can use it to access the back room.
A teacup Iris asked me to get for her. It has a very stylish design.
This is the matchbox Iris asked for. Its logo is quite colorful.
A knife Iris asked me to get for her. Just a normal utensil you'd use during a meal.
A prop sword and shield used onstage. They're well-made and look just like the real thing.
A prop crown used onstage. It's well constructed and incredibly detailed.
A wig and costume used onstage. I wonder what kind of act could use a flashy outfit like this?
A photo of Sakura in her swimsuit. Wow, this is really something. I'm gonna treasure this.
A photo of Sumire in her stage costume. Her distinctive makeup really makes an impact.
It's a photo of Maria on stage in the military uniform from "For Love"… She's a beautiful woman disguised as a man.
A photo of Kanna in her training gear. Catching her in a private moment like this feels surprisingly intimate.
A photo of Iris in her swimsuit. She's holding a rubber ring and looks ready to have some fun. How cute.
A photo of Kohran. I don't get to see her with her braids undone very often. It's a nice look.
A photo of Ayame in a traditional outfit. I hope she'll always be as happy and content as she is here.
Ayame's gun. Why…? Why did it have to turn out like this…?
Jean-Paul the teddy bear. Iris's best friend. She always carries him with her and takes good care of him.

Ayame! 
You did well to make it this far… The time has finally come for us to settle the score. 
Please, move aside, Ayame. 
We have a mission we need to carry out. 
If you insist on getting in our way, we'll have no choice… 
No choice but to do what… 
Heh heh heh… Can you bring yourself to defeat me, Ogami? 
Ayame… 
Heh heh heh… How adorable. Come, let's put an end to this, just you and me. 
Boss, wait! 
It's all right. I'll find a way to bring her around. Don't try to interfere. 
I've been looking forward to this… we can finally put an end to this. I won't let anyone get in the way.

Something's wrong with the main engine. Our power output is going down fast! 
The auxiliary engines are all out of action! There's no way we can fix them on the fly! 
Port-side cannons, out of action! 
Yaaaaaargh!

What?! Even the Mikasa is no match for them…? 
This doesn't change our objective! We must protect the capital at all costs! 
Oh, Lord… Even if it costs me my life, please, let justice be done…! 
Our main cannon's been completely destroyed! 
What?! 
The port-side anti-aircraft cannons have caught fire! 
Raaargh! 
We've lost our auto-flight regulators! We won't be able to stay in the air much longer! 
Switch to manual controls! I'll take the helm. We're not done yet!
