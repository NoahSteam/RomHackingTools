I need to focus! 
Here I go! 
Leave it to me!! 
Watch this, Ogami. 
I'm fine, I can still fight… 
Thank you! 
Keep it up, Ogami! 
I knew I could count on you! 
Kyaaa! 
Ngh, I'll show you next time! 
I'm sorry… Ogami… 
It's my turn in the spotlight. 
Hahaha! 
I'm off!! 
Today's performance is all for you! 
It'll take more than that to bring me down… 
Ensign, so you really do care for me… 
Come, Ensign, it's your move! 
I'll be watching you! 
Uwahhh!! 
I suppose I'll let you win for now! 
The commander needs me!! 
I'll have to take down the enemies myself! 
Where's my next target!? 
Whoever wants to die first, just step forward… 
I'll be relying on your orders, sir! 
I'm not finished yet!! Not yet!! 
!! 
Focus, sir! 
We'll make it out of this alive, sir! 
Ahhh…! 
They're too strong!! I need to withdraw!! 
Forgive me, sir. I need to withdraw! 
I can fight too! 
Here I go! 
I'm super strong! 
I'll fight hard for Uncle Ichi!! 
Uh, some of these lights are flashing… 
You're the best, Uncle Ichi! 
Go get 'em Uncle Ichi! 
I'll be watching! 
Kyaaaa!! 
Stupid… stars… 
Sorry, Uncle Ichi… 
Gonna go all out. 
Better not underestimate science~! 
Movin' out!! 
Check this out! 
I'm takin' too much damage here! 
Aww, you're the best! 
I'm rootin' for ya! 
Take 'em down, boss! 
Uwahhh… 
Dangit… they got me… 
Sorry boss… 
Alright! Let's do this!! 
Full power! Hiyaaaaa! 
Feast your eyes on the killer techniques of the Kirishima! 
Let's take 'em down, boss!! 
No problem! It's just a scratch!! 
Thanks! I owe you one! 
Get in there, boss! 
Let's see what you can do! 
Uwahhh… 
Damn. Guess I still haven't trained enough… 
I've gotta keep fighting… for the boss. 
Alright! 
We did it! 
We did it! 
Phew! 
Nice one! 
Woo! We did it!! 
Hold it right there, Hive of Darkness!! 
The Imperial Combat Revue has arrived!! 
Hmph! So the imperial dogs have come yapping at my heels! 
But I'm afraid you're too late. Fuhahaha! 
I, Jade Setsuna, have already released the 2nd seal of the Hexagram of Infernal Calling! 
Om khili khili vajra hum phat… Om khili khili vajra hum phat… Om khili khili vajra hum phat…
I think everyone will be fine without my protection. 
I will protect you, Sakura! 
I'll always be there to protect you, Sumire. 
Let me watch your back for you, Maria. 
I'll always be there for you, Iris. 
Don't worry, Kohran! I'll protect you! 
Kanna! I've got your back! 
Hahaha…! 
Go my minions, don't let them leave here alive! 
Those drums scattered here and there on the battlefield are nothing but hindrances. Destroy them to clear a path. 
Kanna is skilled at close-range combat. She should join you and Sakura on the front line. 
We need to destroy the enemy leader. You can ignore everything else. 
Oh yeah! My first match! I'm pumped! 
Alright! That's one down! You're a pretty good coach, boss! 
We've got you now, Setsuna! 
Ahahaha… you think so, do you? 
Ogami! There's a boy there that didn't evacuated in time!! 
This is bad, boss! 
What should we do, sir? 
Stop!! 
Got you!! 
Guwahhhhh!! 
We need to focus on attacking! Our first priority is taking down the enemy!! 
Look out!! 
Dammit! What should we do!? 
Fool! Distraction means death on the battlefield! 
My mission is complete. I'm afraid I don't have any more time to waste playing with you! 
Save the kid. 
Hey boss! How do you want me to fight? 
Attack from the back lines. <br> Break through the front line. <br> Go get some lunch? 
Is that some kinda joke, boss? 
When someone new joins your squad, you should at least try to figure out what their strengths are. 
Whatever… 
My specialty is karate. I need to be face-to-face with the enemy. Put me on the front lines! 
Sounds good to me, boss! Looks like you've got my strengths figured out! 
My specialty is karate. I need to be face-to-face with the enemy. Put me on the front lines! 
I'll use my Ryukyu-style karate skills to smash the enemies! 
!! 
!! 
Right… thanks a lot! It was stupid of me to even ask you! 
Hey, don't you know? 
Well, whatever… I guess I can give you a hand this time. 
Ogami, that unit there belongs to Setsuna, one of the leaders of the Hive of Darkness. 
If we defeat it, this whole mess should clear up. We should make it our priority! 
Roger!!
