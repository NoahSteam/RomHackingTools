The Mikasa! <br> Chief Yoneda... <br> Did we do it? 
We... did we win? 
Y-yes, we won! 
Wha... What!? 
I... have returned... I am sin, I am darkness. I am eternal. I am the snake of old. 
The original rebel, who shunned our almighty father. My name is... 
Satan!! 
So that's Aoi Satan's true form? 
Th-that's Satan! Is this.. is this how the world will be destroyed? 
Th-that's Satan! Is this.. is this how the world will be destroyed?

Th-that's Satan! Is this.. is this how the world will be destroyed? 
Yeah... You're right! We won't let him get away with this! 
No matter how desperate things look, we won't give up! We will be victorious in the end! 
The lives of all the people in the world depend on us! 
Ugh! 
!? 
Ms... Ms. Ayame? 
Archangel... Michael? 
But... I can't... I lost someone... very dear to me... 
...!

Lieutenant General! Energy levels in the Spirit Cannon are rising fast! 
What?! 
Third main cannon, destroyed! That's all the main cannons gone! 
The main engine is overheating! 
We can't continue fighting! If we go on, the Spirit Cannon will...! 
Very well... Evacuate! 
Lieutenant General! 
What about you, sir? Aren't you coming? 
Me? Ha! I have one last trump card left... 
Huh!? ...Impossible! 
Evacuate now! 
Lieutenant General! 
Get out of here! 
Y-yes, sir! 
Ohoho... You've given me a nice place to die a soldier's death, Ayame! 
I have to thank you! 
All engines, full power! Our target is... the Sacred Demon Castle! 
Don't underestimate us humans! 
Attaaaaaaack! 
The high angel Lucifer, arch-angel of the highest stratum, the being said to be closest to God... 
He used his boundless power to rebel against his heavenly father... And after a ferocious battle, he was defeated. 
The Lord cast Lucifer down from the heavens, and far he fell to the bottom of the earth. 
This was how hell came into being. 
And thus, Lucifer became the perennial opponent to God... He was reborn as Satan, King of Devils. 
Come forth...! 
The time of judgment has arrived... This world will be cast into the darkness of beginning. 
Cry, you heavens! Quake, you lands! Today is the day that brings the Great Darkness! 
Today, our wish will finally be fulfilled!

We must not lose heart! That would be like selling your soul to the devil!

Let there be... light... 
Stand up... 
No, I am the lord of angels, arch-angel Michael. 
I have walked with Satan on his path, drenched in immeasurable sin, and I have led him... 
When Satan returns, so will I... 
I was sealed in the body of this person. 
Stand up now. If you desire to save the world, get up and stand on your own two legs! 
Bringing justice can be a terrible thing. Sometimes blood has to be spilled. 
But what counts is an unwavering spirit... 
And a loving heart. If you have those two, you cannot lose! 
No matter what stands in your way... The light of hope lives in people's hearts. 
Now go... and fight for all that is good! 
I pray that our heavenly Father will grant you His blessings.
