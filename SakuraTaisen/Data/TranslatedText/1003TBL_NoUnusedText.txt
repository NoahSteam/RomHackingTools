That's Sakura's photo. I'm staring at this. I wonder what she is thinking...
Ah, this is Sumirei's photo. She doesn't usually show it, but this one has her whole face.
Maria's photo. ...lost in thought. She somehow looks sad.
Connor's photo. As you see, Connor's powerful appearace comes through.
A photo of Iris. She's surrounded by flowers and flashing a radiant smile.
A photo of Kohran. She's looking pretty in profile with her face dyed red by the evening sun.
A letter given to me by a customer. I was asked to give it to Sumire. I have a bad feeling about this...
Maria's pistol. This may help me escape from here...
A hair ornament. It's decorated with flowers and looks very elegant.
A pretty pendant. The delicate workmanship is gorgeous.
A hairpin for use in a traditional bun hairstyle. It would complement a formal outfit well.
This key will let me enter rooms I couldn't before.
I found this in a bedroom on the second floor. I can use it to access the back room.
A teacup Iris asked me to get for her. It has a very stylish design.
This is the matchbox Iris asked for. Its logo is quite colorful.
A knife Iris asked me to get for her. Just a normal utensil you'd use during a meal.
A prop sword and shield used onstage. They're well-made and look just like the real thing.
A prop crown used onstage. It's well-constructed and incredibly detailed.
A wig and costume used onstage. I wonder what kind of act could use a flashy outfit like this?
A photo of Sakura in her swimsuit. Wow, this is really something. I'm gonna treasure this.
A photo of Sumire in her stage costume. Her distinctive makeup really makes an impact.
It's a photo of Maria on stage in the military uniform from "For Love"... She's a beautiful woman disguised as a man.
A photo of Kanna in her training gear. Catching her in a private moment like this feels surprisingly intimate.
A photo of Iris in her swimsuit. She's holding a rubber ring and looks ready to have some fun. How cute.
A photo of Kohran. I don't get to see her with her braids undone very often. It's a nice look.
A photo of Ayame in a traditional outfit. I hope she'll always be as happy and content as she is here.
Ayame's gun. Why...? Why did it have to turn out like this...?
Jean-Paul the teddy bear. Iris's best friend. She always carries him with her and takes good care of him.
The Mikasa!<br>Chief Yoneda...<br>Did we do it?
We... did we win?
Y-yes, we won!
Wha... What!?
I... have returned... I am sin, I am darkness. I am eternal. I am the snake of old.
The original rebel, who shunned our allmighty father. My name is...
Satan!!
So that's Aoi Satan's true form?
Th, that's Satan! Is this, Is this how the world will be destroyed?
Th, that's Satan! Is this, Is this how the world will be destroyed?
Th, that's Satan! Is this, Is this how the world will be destroyed?
Th, that's Satan! Is this, Is this how the world will be destroyed?
Th, that's Satan! Is this, Is this how the world will be destroyed?
Th, that's Satan! Is this, Is this how the world will be destroyed?
Yeah... You're right! We won't let him get away with this!
No matter how desperate things look, we won't give up! We will be victorious in the end!
The lives of all the people in the world depend on us!
Ugh!
!?
Ms... Ms. Ayame?
Archangel...Michael?
But... I can't... I lost someone... very dear to me...
...!
...Huh!?
This is the end of the world... the end...
Greed... wrath... envy... The spirit cannon is powered by all of humanity's vices.
Whan Lord Satan's prayer is completed, this fire will mark the 12th hour...
And then, the light of darkness will wash over the world and turn it black!
Hahahaha...
Hihihi... The Shogeimaru's measly cannons can't even scratch the castle's front gate.
And what did I do? I just sat in my chair, sending those girls into battle...
I'm a failure as a soldier.
But still, I loved you more than anyone and would have done anything to protect your lives...
But Ayame... We cannot leave this world to the demons!
Looks like Yoneda pulled out his trump card.
Even so, it will all be in vain.
Let's get out our trump card as well, then...
Go and give them my regards, "Three Knights of Twilight"...
Something's wrong with the main engine. Our power output is going down fast!
The auxiliary engines are all out of action! There's no way we can fix them on the fly!
Port-side cannons, out of action!
Yaaaaaargh!
Untranslated
What?! Even the Mikasa is no match for them...?
This doesn't change our objective! We must protect the capital at all costs!
Oh, Lord... Even if it costs me my life, please, let justice be done...!
Our main cannon's been completely destroyed!
What?!
The port-side anti-aircraft cannons have caught fire!
Nraaargh!
We've lost our auto-flight regulators! We won't be able to stay in the air much longer!
Switch to manual controls! I'll take the helm. We're not done yet!
Lieutenant General! Energy levels in the Spirit Cannon are rising fast!
What?!
Third main cannon, destroyed! That's all the main cannons gone!
The main engine is overheating!
We can't continue fighting! If we go on, the Spirit Cannon will...!
Very well... Evacuate!
Lieutenant General!
What about you, sir? Aren't you coming?
Me? Ha! I have one last trump card left...
Huh!? ...Impossible!
Evacuate now!
Lieutenant General!
Get out of here!
Y-yes, sir!
Hoho... You've given me a nice place to die a soldier's death, Ayame!
I have to thank you!
All engines, full power! Our target is... the Sacred Demon Castle!
Don't underestimate us humans!
Attaaaaaaack!
The high angel Lucifer, arch-angel of the highest stratum, the being said to be closest to God...
He used his boundless power to rebel against his heavenly father... And after a ferocious battle, he was defeated.
The Lord cast Lucifer down from the heavens, and far he fell to the bottom of the earth.
This was how hell came into being.
And thus, Lucifer became the perennial opponent to God... He was reborn as Satan, King of Devils.
Come forth...
The time of judgment has arrived... This world will be cast into the darkness of beginning.
Cry, you heavens! Quake, you lands! Today is the day that brings the great Darkness!
Today, our wish will finally be fulfilled!
Come forth!

We must not lose heart! That would be like selling your soul to the devil!

Let there be... light...
Stand up...
No, I am the lord of angels, arch-angel Michael.
I have walked with Satan on his path, drenched in immeasurable sin, and I have led him...
When Satan returns, so will I...
I was sealed in the body of this person.
Stand up now. If you desire to save the world, get up and stand on your own two legs!
Bringing justice can be a terrible thing. Sometimes blood has to be spilled.
But what counts is an unwavering spirit...
And a loving heart. If you have those two, you cannot lose!
No matter what stands in your way... The light of hope lives in people's hearts.
Now go... and fight for all that is good!
I pray that our heavenly Father will grant you His blessings.
Ah... gh... grhhh... aghhh
Ahhhghh.... Mi... chael...
Come home with me, Satan. Our Father, which dwells in Heaven, awaits you.
Michael. Are you saying that I am forgiven?
God's time is eternal, as is His love.
There is no sin so great it cannot be washed clean.
Michael.
You're not alone. Come.
Nraggggh!! Silence!!
I apologize for nothing! I regret nothing! Not my rebellion against Father, nor my fall to Hell!
The 'love' of Heaven is naught but a falsehood! I will never understand our Father's tolerance for these humans!
Or else, why would they keep killing, keep seeding hatred, keep destroying life?
Their thoughts do not extend beyond the here and now.
They will never know what love is! They will never be at home in God's realm!
They are only fit to live a life of desperation, trembling in the darkness! Hihihi... Huahahahaha!
I will withdraw for now. But, as long as humans exist, I shall be reborn time and time again!!
Satan! Return with me!!
I don't need Heaven's light!! I have lived by the sword, and now I will die by the sword!!
Satan...
Thank you, Imperial Combat Revue.
But, sadly this does not mean an end to the fighting.
You're true fight is just beginning.

Farewell, everyone.
Hey! That's not a face a man should make. Pull yourself together!
That is more acceptable.
Fare thee well, Ogami.

Commander...
No... Sorry, I was lost in thought.
I could ask you the same thing.
I see... This enemy we're about to face seems almost invincible...
To be honest, I have no idea if we are powerful enough...
But still, we have to fight... we have to beat him!
So we can protect what's important to us...
Captain! What are you saying?!
You shouldn't joke about something like that! I don't even want to think about it...
I believe in you... we all do.
Commander...
Of course...
What do you mean?
Commander, that's...
I... Maybe I've become weak.
This moment in time... I can't bear the thought of it passing. I never felt like this before.
Commander...
Mr. Ogami. What are you doing here?
I can see in your face that's not true. There's something, I don't know...
Something sad about it...
But... Mr. Ogami! What happened!? Why are you so...
You see? My heart... It's pounding like crazy.
We're all in this together. And I bet we all feel the same, more or less.
I'm afraid too. If I was alone I'd probably be petrified...
I'm not as strong as everyone else yet... not as strong as my father.
But everyone's there for me... And you always have a word of encouragement for me. That gives me the strength to fight!
I can keep going because of you!
Don't ever call yourself pathetic!
You keep me going...
And that's why you have to fight! No one else will protect Teito, and the future of mankind!
Let's keep fighting, Mr. Ogami... You and me together!
Everyone's on the bridge. They're waiting for their commander... for you!
God!
Yes, ma'am!
We must not lose heart! That would be like selling your soul to the devil!
We must not lose heart! That would be like selling your soul to the devil!
We must not lose heart! That would be like selling your soul to the devil!
We must not lose heart! That would be like selling your soul to the devil!
