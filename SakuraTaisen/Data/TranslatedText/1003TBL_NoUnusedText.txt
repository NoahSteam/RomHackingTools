The rebellion of the primordial to the all mighty father. My name is...... 
Satan!! 
Is... is that his true character? 
Th, that's Satan! Like this, this is how the world be destroyed? 
Th, that's Satan! Is this... is this how the world will be destroyed?

Minister! <br> The spirit gun energy <br> It's getting tall quickly! 
What?! 
The third main gun is wrecked! <br> The main gun is annihilated! 
The main engine is overheating! 
We cannot stop the war!! So if we use the little spirit cannon...! 
Okay! You all escape! 
Minister!! 
Minister?....How are you doing? 
You guys? He he he... <br> You guys... still have weapons. <br> It's the last trumpet... isn't it.... 
Ah!....Oh no! 
Escape! 
Minister! 
Escape!! 
Y....yes! 
Ayame! Heheheh... this is a good place to meet a soldier's death. 
I appreciate it! 
Everyone! Give it your all!! The goal is...Satan!! 
Don't let them underestimate humanity!
Great attack!! 
Lucifer was once worshiped as a leader of the angels and the archangel closest to God... 
In order to be the most powerful, he went against his father and was undefeated. 
God, the father, expelled Lucifer from the heavenly world. He cast him down to the bottom of an endless land. 
This is the beginning of hell. 
So Lucifer became the eternal enemy of God. This is the Devil king's testimony. 
Come.... 
The time of judgment has come.....this world will return to the darkness of the beginning. 
Heaven weeps... and the earth quakes with fear... soon, it will engulf the planet. Today begins the reign of darkness!!! 
It is the day the court fulfills it's hope!

Don't waste your time with this! If you do, you are selling your soul to the devil!

Light... huh? 
Please stand up.... 
I am the archangel Michael... 
The fallen Satan on the endless road of penitence walks to the well and guides.
At the time of Satan's resurrection.... <br> I am still resurrected.... 
I was sealed in this body of flesh. 
Well stand up then. The world is hurting... Stand on your own two feet! 
Sometimes I have to keep going even when there are a lot of dead bodies. 
But! <br> Nothing can beat great courage... 
The connection of love that binds people together... will be the final winner! 
Whatever problem there may be... The light of hope is in the heart of man... 
Please go.... Then it will show justice! 
You all are a big blessing to our father.

Don't be discouraged by such things! That would be like selling your soul to the devil! 
Don't let yourself be discouraged by this! That would be like selling your soul to the devil!
Are you getting discouraged by this?! That's like selling your soul to the devil!
Stop!
