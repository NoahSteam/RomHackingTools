﻿﻿﻿﻿Iris! Hold up! 
No! Go away!! 
Sakura, we're going to need to catch Iris before we can talk to her. 
Right! 
You're… You're all liars! 
Iris! Please stop! 
No! 
Iris, stop! 
Noooooo!! 
Ogami. 
Ma'am?! 
Iris is quite agitated right now. Being treated like a child has left her in a great deal of distress. 
If you don't end her rampage quickly, not only will the city be in ruins, but her heart will be as well! 
But stopping her with force will only make things worse. 
Iris doesn't trust you all because she was lied to… 
Then… What am I supposed to do?! 
Why do you think Iris has stayed here when she has the ability to teleport anywhere she likes? 
Deep down inside, she's crying out for help… from you, Ogami. 
You can do this. Be true to yourself, and be honest. 
Stand firm, Captain. 
Sakura, we need to pin Iris down. Let's come at her from both sides and box her in! 
Roger! 
Ogami! Now, quickly! 
Hurry, Ogami! Open the hatch, now! 
Iris! 
No! 
Persuade her. <br> Scold her. 
Iris, please listen to me! I know I lied to you. 
Iris, please listen to me! I know I lied to you. 
Iris, please listen to me! I know I lied to you. 
As you are now, I can't think of you as my girlfriend. 
I knew it… It's because I'm a child… 
But… I had a good time going out with you. Being together with you really was fun. 
But I always have fun when we're together. You're… a precious, irreplaceable friend. 
We've come so far… We can't lose you now! 
M-Mon Frère… 
No one knows what the future will bring… So we can't let this be the end. 
Mon Frère… You're not lying… 
Come on, now… Open up the hatch. 
Enough of this nonsense, Iris! 
… 
Take a look around you! Everyone is fighting desperately to protect the capital! 
But… everyone keeps saying I'm just a child… 
Nobody's actually worried about me… 
You're all grown-up! <br> It’s fine to be a child! 
You're all grown-up! 
You're all grown-up! 
Huh…? 
You don't really feel that way! You're lying again! 
(Crap!) 
Does it matter if you're a child? I like you just fine the way you are now. 
Iris… Everyone was a child at some point, right? 
Besides, once you've grown up, you can never return to being a child, no matter how much you may want to. 
… 
Sakura's right, you know. And no matter what, you're our very dear friend. 
Mon Frère… you're not lying… 
Come on, now… Open up the hatch. 
Stupid Frère! 
Ogami, Sakura. Make contact with Iris and try talking to her. 
If the two of you can get between her, you should be able to get her to talk. 
I think everyone will be fine without my protection. 
I will protect you, Sakura! 
I'll always be there to protect you, Sumire. 
Let me watch your back for you, Maria. 
I'll always be there for you, Iris.
Don't worry, Kohran! I'll protect you! 
Kanna! I've got your back!
