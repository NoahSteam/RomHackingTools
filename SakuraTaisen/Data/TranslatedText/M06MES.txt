﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿Ready… 
Victory pose… Yeah! 
The Imperial Assault Troupe has arrived! 
Hahaha… Burn, BURN!! 
Ngh… Looks like I'll have to pull out my trump card and drown you all in a sea of blood. 
Owahhhhh! 
Om khili khili vajra hum phat… Om khili khili vajra hum phat… Om khili khili vajra hum phat… 
Om khili khili vajra hum phat… Om khili khili vajra hum phat… Om khili khili vajra hum phat… 
Hiyaaaa! 
What? Where did you come from?! 
It's OK, Iris. You're not in trouble or anything, so come on over here. 
Irisss… You're such a smart little girl. Why don't you come over here? 
There's a good kid. C'mon over. 
Got you! Now behave yourself. 
You're not slipping away again! 
OK, now you just be a good girl! 
You… You're all… liars! 
My… My beautiful machine! What have you done to it!? 
What should we do, sir!? 
We have to save Iris! <br> We must take down the enemy!
Damn… OK! Everyone, hold off the enemies! I'll get in there and stop Iris! 
This is bad… OK! Everyone, guard against the enemy's attacks! I'm going to stop Iris! 
But if you do that, she'll start attacking us too! 
It's too dangerous! 
We can't just let it go on like this. Iris and the civilians around here will be in danger… 
I've got to do this. 
!! 
Ogami! Take me with you! 
We need to take care of the enemy first! 
Wait, Chief! What about Iris? 
Ah! Sakura! Sir, Sakura's Koubu is moving out! 
Leave Iris to me! Everyone else, focus on the enemies! 
I knew it… You don't care about me at all, Mon Frère!! 
Iris! Wait! 
Damn. Iris, or the enemy… Which one should be our priority… 
All right Iris, let's go!! 
Yeah!! 
Iris… Thank God… 
You really had us worried. Good grief… 
This is your first battle. Show them what you can do, Iris! 
All right! Now the whole Flower Division is together! 
OK, let's dive right back into the fight! 
The Imperial Assault Troupe has arrived! 
So I just need to move this switch, right? Here I go! 
Good! The gate opened! Everyone, get in there! 
Wait!! 
No!! 
Good grief, that's one tough gate. My attacks can't even put a scratch on it… 
Oh, the gate opened! Everyone, get in there! 
Ogami! I'll activate the steam circuits that open and close the Kaminarimon gate. 
This is going to be a little messy but… here we go! 
Uwah, what's going on!? 
Kyaa, what's going on!? 
Kyaa, what on earth is happening!? 
What!? 
Uwah!! What the heck!? 
Waaah!! What the hey!? 
Kyaaa!! How did I get over here!? 
Hahaha! One by one I'll send each of you to Hell with my summoning magic. 
Then you'll see how it feels to watch your comrades die before your eyes!! 
Ogami! Hurry up and open the Kaminarimon gate! 
Ogami! I'm heading your way with the Soaring Whale! You have to hold out until I arrive! 
Yes ma'am! 
All right, we did it!! Victory pose… 
The scene that awaited us after the battle was… 
A busted up Koubu, and inside was a dazed Sakura and… 
Iris, sleeping peacefully beside her… 
Against the backdrop of the completely destroyed Kaminarimon. 
Ogami! Focus on eliminating the Rearguard mechs first! 
The enemy looks fairly powerful, so make sure to keep your defenses up as you fight. 
I think everyone will be fine without my protection. 
I will protect you, Sakura! 
I'll always be there to protect you, Sumire. 
Let me watch your back for you, Maria. 
I'll always be there for you, Iris. 
Don't worry, Kohran! I'll protect you! 
Kanna! I've got your back! 
Iris, what do you think of Captain Ogami? 
Ehehe… I looove Mon Frère! 
If Mon Frère's with me, I'm a million times stronger!! 
Ogami, you should take care of Iris. 
The enemy is guarding the steam circuits that keep the Kaminarimon gate closed. If we could take back that point… 
Captain, the enemy is at Senso-ji Temple on the other side of the Kaminarimon gate. Crush them with a single blow. 
You make it sound easy, but they've got Kaminarimon locked up tight. 
There's no time to waste… It's a painful decision, but we need to take down the Kaminarimon gate. 
We lack the firepower. Last time it burned down, they rebuilt the whole thing using Celesteel! 
Our Koubu weapons will bounce right off it, and even the Soaring Whale's cannons wouldn't put a scratch on it. 
What? So there's no way for us to get inside!? 
Don't you panic. There should be controls to open the gate somewhere on the inside. 
Seems the enemy is keeping them guarded. But… how are we going to get in? Our Koubus can't jump those walls! 
Just leave it to me! 
Looks like we don't have any options. Everyone, focus on taking down the Rearguards for now!! 
You insects. If you don't swarm together, you're completely useless. 
I am Rasetsu, and I will make you pay for killing my brother… I will make you pay dearly! 
Tremble before the might of the Hive of Darkness! 
But first, Ogami… Before I send you to Hell, answer me one question… 
Which of your squad members is dearest to you? 
Sakura. <br> Sumire. <br> Someone else. 
Maria. <br> Iris. <br> Someone else. 
Kohran. <br> Kanna. 
Sakura. 
O-Ogami!? 
So it's Sakura. Hehehe… I see. 
Sumire. 
E-Ensign!? 
So it's Sumire. Hehehe… I see. 
Maria. 
C-Captain!? 
So it's Maria. Hehehe… I see. 
Iris. 
Mon Frère!? 
So it's Iris. Hehehe… I see. 
Iris. 
Interesting choice, considering you abandoned her. Seems you hold YOURSELF more dearly than your comrades. 
Kohran. 
Chief!? 
So it's Kohran. Hehehe… I see. 
Kanna. 
Boss!? 
So it's Kanna. Hehehe… I see. 
… 
…I see… So that's the extent of your feelings for the Flower Division… 
I've got to focus! 
Here I go! 
Leave it to me!! 
Watch this, Ogami. 
I'm fine, I can still fight… 
Thank you! 
Keep it up, Ogami! 
I knew I could count on you! 
Kyaaa! 
Ngh, I'll show you next time! 
I'm sorry… Ogami… 
It's my turn in the spotlight. 
Hahaha! 
I'm off!! 
Today's performance is all for you! 
It'll take more than that to bring me down… 
Ensign, so you really do care for me… 
Come, Ensign, it's your move! 
I'll be watching you! 
Uwahhh!! 
I suppose I'll let you win for now! 
The captain needs me!! 
I'll have to take down the enemies myself! 
Where's my next target!? 
Whoever wants to die first, just step forward… 
I'll be relying on your orders, sir! 
I'm not finished yet!! Not yet!! 
You would go that far… for my sake… 
Focus, sir! 
We'll make it out of this alive! 
Ahhh!! 
They're too strong!! I need to withdraw!! 
Forgive me, sir. I need to withdraw! 
I can fight too! 
Here I go! 
I'm super strong! 
I'll fight hard for Mon Frère!! 
Uh, some of these lights are flashing… 
You're the best, Mon Frère! 
Go get 'em Mon Frère! 
I'll be watching! 
Kyaaaa!! 
Stupid… stars… 
Sorry, Mon Frère… 
Gonna go all out. 
Better not underestimate science~! 
Movin' out!! 
Check this out! 
I'm takin' too much damage here! 
Aww, you're the best, Chief! 
I'm rootin' for ya! 
Take 'em down, Boss! 
Uwahhh… 
Dangit… They got me… 
Sorry Chief… 
All right! Let's do this!! 
Full power! Hiyaaaaa! 
Feast your eyes on the killer techniques of the Kirishima! 
Let's take 'em down, Boss!! 
No problem! It's just a scratch!! 
Thanks! I owe you one! 
Get in there, Boss! 
Let's see what you can do! 
Uwahhh… 
Damn. Guess I still haven't trained enough… 
I've gotta keep fighting… for the Boss. 
All right! 
We did it! 
We did it! 
Phew! 
Nice one! 
Woo! We did it!!
