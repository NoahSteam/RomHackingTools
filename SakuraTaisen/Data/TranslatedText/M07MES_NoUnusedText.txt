I need to focus! 
Here I go! 
Leave it to me!! 
Watch this, Ogami. 
I'm fine, I can still fight… 
Thank you! 
Keep it up, Ogami! 
I knew I could count on you! 
Kyaaa! 
Ngh, I'll show you next time! 
I'm sorry… Ogami… 
It's my turn in the spotlight. 
Hahaha! 
I'm off!! 
Today's performance is all for you! 
It'll take more than that to bring me down… 
Ensign, so you really do care for me… 
Come, Ensign, it's your move! 
I'll be watching you! 
Uwahhh!! 
I suppose I'll let you win for now! 
The commander needs me!! 
I'll have to take down the enemies myself! 
Where's my next target!? 
Whoever wants to die first, just step forward… 
I'll be relying on your orders, sir! 
I'm not finished yet!! Not yet!! 
You would go that far… for my sake… 
Focus, sir! 
We'll make it out of this alive, sir! 
Ahhh!! 
They're too strong!! I need to withdraw!! 
Forgive me, sir. I need to withdraw! 
I can fight too! 
Here I go! 
I'm super strong! 
I'll fight hard for Uncle Ichi!! 
Uh, some of these lights are flashing… 
You're the best, Uncle Ichi! 
Go get 'em Uncle Ichi! 
I'll be watching! 
Kyaaaa!! 
Stupid… stars… 
Sorry, Uncle Ichi… 
Gonna go all out. 
Better not underestimate science~! 
Movin' out!! 
Check this out! 
I'm takin' too much damage here! 
Aww, you're the best! 
I'm rootin' for ya! 
Take 'em down, boss! 
Uwahhh… 
Dangit… they got me… 
Sorry boss… 
Alright! Let's do this!! 
Full power! Hiyaaaaa! 
Feast your eyes on the killer techniques of the Kirishima! 
Let's take 'em down, boss!! 
No problem! It's just a scratch!! 
Thanks! I owe you one! 
Get in there, boss! 
Let's see what you can do! 
Uwahhh… 
Damn. Guess I still haven't trained enough… 
I've gotta keep fighting… for the boss. 
Alright! 
We did it! 
We did it! 
Phew! 
Nice one! 
Woo! We did it!! 
Well then… 
Here we go! 
Victory pose… cheese! 
Om khili khili vajra hum phat… Om khili khili vajra hum phat… Om khili khili vajra hum phat…
The Imperial Combat Revue has arrived! 
Hehehe, look at all these little moths fluttering into my flame. 
You'll burn brilliantly when my elite troop is done with you! 
I am Crimson Miroku, I suppose I can play with you, as you wish. 
We've got you! You can't run now! 
Hahaha, you think a little thing like this could bring me down? 
Hm? I can't move! 
Hmph… don't think this is over! 
Hahaha. 
Hey, what're you doing all the way over there! 
Sakura! Why didn't you land somewhere closer? 
I'm sorry. The terrain here is difficult, so this is the closest I could get! 
Damn, our force is split… Everyone, be careful! 
Hey! You're just gonna get in the way, so don't bother coming over here! 
Oh come now. Acting as my shield is a perfect role for a giant bundle of muscles like you! 
Well hiding behind me is a perfect role for a wimp like you! 
Ha! And you'll just get in the way, so why don't you stand back! 
Come now, my loyal servants. I summon thee, Crimson Hornet Squad! 
Hahaha… let us begin with the trial… 
… what are you talking about? 
Well, looks like that beam was just a diversion. 
Make sure to think about everyone's range. That way you'll get the most out of Maria and Kohran. 
Commander Ogami, it's up to you to protect Kanna and Sumire. 
Hahaha… well well, not bad. I suppose I should give you a little reward. 
Hahaha… how do you like my present? 
Who're you gonna stand with anyway, boss? 
Alright, boss! I knew you'd get it! Okay, let's give 'em hell! 
Ohhhh, so that's how you feel. 
Well, please don't let me get in your way! Enjoy monkeying around with that muscle-bound ape woman! 
Hey, what did you just say!! 
Huh, well fine! No need to explain! I really misjudged you, boss! 
Ahahaha! That's my Ensign. I knew you'd make the right choice. 
? What's the matter boss? You went all quiet. 
I think that's an understandable response, considering your idiotic question. 
The hell did you just say!? 
Would you two cut it out! We need to focus on taking down the Hive of Darkness! 
Are you two seriously going to have an argument right here in the middle of the battlefield!? 
!! 
…you're correct, of course, commander. 
Kanna, perhaps it would be best for us to call a truce for the time being? 
Right! We've got a common enemy to think about right now. Let's take down the Hive of Darkness! 
And who will you be standing with, commander? 
Why have you gone quiet? Is something the matter? 
Your dumbass question is what's the matter!! 
Excuse me!? 
!! 
…yeah, the commander is right. 
Listen, Sumire. Let's call a truce for now, okay? 
Understood. There is a more important enemy before us! Let's eliminate the Hive of Darkness! 
The Crimson Wasps can move twice. To fight them effectively we'll need to seal their movements! 
For enemies on the cliff, you should have Kohran take them down from a distance or send Iris over there! 
Nice going. 
Hey, you're stronger than I thought! 
Well, quite the performance. 
I must say, you're far stronger than I thought. 
Kanna. <br> Sumire. 
… whatever. For now I need to focus on this… 
You've kept me waiting, Imperial Combat Revue. I'm anxious to start our dance! 
I tuned up all the Koubus just like you asked, boss. Do they look alright? 
It's just as Miroku says. We need to clear up the entire Crimson Wasp Squad. 
Ogami, show me what you can do! Take down every last unit of the Crimson Wasp Squad!! 
Once they're defeated, you'll be able to pull Miroku out for battle. 
I think everyone will be fine without my protection. 
I will protect you, Sakura! 
I'll always be there to protect you, Sumire. 
Let me watch your back for you, Maria. 
I'll always be there for you, Iris. 
Don't worry, Kohran! I'll protect you! 
Kanna! I've got your back! 
Hey, boss! I don't know why, but I'm feeling super pumped today. 
And… I feel like I can get even stronger if I'm with you… 
So I want to fight by your side today. 
Alright, boss, we got this! 
Ensign… it seems I'm in top form today. 
I'll give you a fine show today. More magnificent than ever before. 
Ensign… stand by my side, today. I promise you won't regret it. 
Satan… The Combat Revue gave you so much trouble, yet now they will fall by my hand. 
And then Tenkai will place his faith in me, and me alone… hahahaha…
