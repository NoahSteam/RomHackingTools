﻿﻿﻿﻿It's a photo of Sakura. She's looking right at me. I wonder what she's thinking…
It's a photo of Sumire. This is a side of her you don't see too often.
It's a photo of Maria. …She's lost in thought and looks kind of sad…
A photo of Kanna. Her signature strength comes through clearly.
A photo of Iris. She's surrounded by flowers and flashing a radiant smile.
A photo of Kohran. She's looking pretty in profile with her face dyed red by the evening sun.
A letter given to me by a customer. I was asked to give it to Sumire. I have a bad feeling about this…
Maria's pistol. This may help me escape from here…
A hair ornament. It's decorated with flowers and looks very elegant.
A pretty pendant. The delicate workmanship is gorgeous.
A hairpin for use in a traditional bun hairstyle. It would complement a formal outfit well.
This key will let me enter rooms I couldn't before.
I found this in a bedroom on the second floor. I can use it to access the back room.
A teacup Iris asked me to get for her. It has a very stylish design.
This is the matchbox Iris asked for. Its logo is quite colorful.
A knife Iris asked me to get for her. Just a normal utensil you'd use during a meal.
A prop sword and shield used onstage. They're well-made and look just like the real thing.
A prop crown used onstage. It's well constructed and incredibly detailed.
A wig and costume used onstage. I wonder what kind of act could use a flashy outfit like this?
A photo of Sakura in her swimsuit. Wow, this is really something. I'm gonna treasure this.
A photo of Sumire in her stage costume. Her distinctive makeup really makes an impact.
It's a photo of Maria on stage in the military uniform from "For Love"… She's a beautiful woman disguised as a man.
A photo of Kanna in her training gear. Catching her in a private moment like this feels surprisingly intimate.
A photo of Iris in her swimsuit. She's holding a rubber ring and looks ready to have some fun. How cute.
A photo of Kohran. I don't get to see her with her braids undone very often. It's a nice look.
A photo of Ayame in a traditional outfit. I hope she'll always be as happy and content as she is here.
Ayame's gun. Why…? Why did it have to turn out like this…?
Jean-Paul the teddy bear. Iris's best friend. She always carries him with her and takes good care of him.
New Year's Day is a good time for new beginnings. Not bad to spend the first day reading. 
Maybe I should come here again tonight. 
Yeah… It wouldn't be bad to have a lazy New Year while eating oranges. 
On the other hand, maybe I shouldn't miss the chance to invite someone to the first shrine visit. 
On New Year's Eve, we were partying here until late at night. 
Once the night is over, the new year will be there. A strange feeling. 
It's been three months since the Hive’s shenanigans… Ginza has been almost completely rebuilt. 
I'm just happy we can celebrate the New Year in peace. 
I don't have duty on New Year's Day. I can stretch my bones all day if I want. 
The Flower Division also has the day off. Maybe I should ask someone out to visit the shrine. 
The strong sunlight of Winter is even coming in here. 
The weather's fine again today. An ideal day for going out. 
…There's no one here. Is everyone in their rooms? 
Maybe I should ask someone out to visit the shrine later. 
The manager… He's been drinking non-stop since yesterday. 
Let's go to another room. 
Manager Yoneda, it's me, Ogami… 
ZZZZZzzz… ZZZZZzzz… 
Not a chance. As I thought, he's passed out… 
Yuri and Kasumi seem to be off duty on New Year's Day. 
Boring… I should check out another room. 
No one here. Looks like I have to go someplace else. 
…Is everyone in their own rooms? 
Yesterday we had a big party here… 
Kohran brought out her spinning plates routine again. We all had tons of fun. 
This room is still a mess… 
I should go somewhere else. There's nothing to do in this room when I'm not on duty. 
Since we did that big end-of-year cleaning, the floor is spotless. 
I guess there's no reason why anyone would be here. Let's go somewhere else. 
We all made New Year's Eve noodles here yesterday… 
Maria's and Sakura's noodles looked almost perfect. 
Iris on the other hand looked like she was handling play dough. 
We ate our New Year's Eve noodles here yesterday. 
Kanna had dozens of bowls and stacked them up in little towers when they were empty. 
Tsubaki is on vacation too? I'd hoped I could buy some portrait cards today… 
Thanks to this holiday I'm free from my ticket puncher duties for once. 
Maybe I shouldn't waste this chance to ask someone out to visit the shrine. 
Whoa… A small mountain of New Year's cards! 
I guess the Flower Division has a lot of fans who send them cards. 
I should look through them later. Maybe there's one or two for me? 
Not a soul in sight. Makes sense, since there aren't any performances during the holidays. 
They probably haven't much to do, so I should ask someone out to visit the shrine. 
…No one here. 
Sakura demolished this stage last year. It seems forever ago… 
It's everyone from the Flower Division. I'm sure there'll be lots of action this year too. 
Ugh… What am I doing here on New Year's Day? 
Maybe all this laziness is getting to me. 
New Year's Day is a good time for new beginnings. It wouldn't be bad to do some workout here… 
…On second thought, no. I wouldn't want to get sore on the first day of the year. 
This pool is heated by steam engines in the basement. 
In the Navy, we did ice swimming contests… The Floral Assault Troupe have it good. 
Yesterday, Kohran was polishing the Koubu up to a sheen… 
Including the Koubu in our big end-of-year cleaning… That's Kohran for you! 
No one here, huh? Boring. 
I should go someplace else. 
No one here. Let's check another room. 
I hope I won't need this place this year. 
Taking care of yourself is the most important thing. 
Pretty quiet down here. Anyway, there's no one here. 
Is everyone in their own rooms? Maybe I should ask someone out to visit the shrine. 
Can't this steam processor predict my fortune for the coming year? 
No, that's absurd… If I want my fortune read, I should get a fortune slip at the shrine. 
That reminds me, I really should invite someone to visit the shrine together. 
I just wish nothing will happen during the holidays that would make us need to use this room. 
Happy New Year, Sakura! 
Let's work hard to make this a great year! 
What? 
(…How is it plain?) 
(What a get-up!) 
(But… How is this dress plain?) 
(What's that supposed to be? A turban? Or a hair pin?) 
(She's almost dressed like she's on stage.) 
(But… isn't it too heavy?) 
(Sumire's eyes are sparkling.) 
(The eyes of an actress… If a girl wears make-up, she becomes an actress.) 
(Gotta admit, it only makes Sumire prettier…) 
(This dress doesn't have much of a cleavage.) 
(She's showing less skin than usual. Kind of a shame…) 
Huh? 
It looks great on you! <br> Don't get so angry… 
It looks great on you, Sumire! 
Don't get so angry… It's a new year, so let's try to get along. 
Ha… Hahaha, really? 
(…I'm used to it by now.) 
Hey, Maria. Happy New Year! 
Happy New Year, I guess. 
Hey, Iris. Happy New Year! 
Hahaha… It's a little too early for that… 
Kanna, Happy New Year! 
Hey… Let's not start the new year like that. 
Y-yes… 
Hahaha… 
(But… Starting the year off with some peace and quiet is really great…) 
Phew, maybe I had a little too much New Year's sake… My head's killing me. 
Ensign Ogami, Ensign Ogami. Manager Yoneda wants to see you. Please come to the manager's office. 
Manager Yoneda? What does he want from me? Well, I guess I'll find out… 
Let's go. 
Hey, Sakura… Are you going visiting the shrine? 
Y-yeah… 
Wanna go together? <br> I'm busy unfortunately… 
What do you say… Wanna go together? 
Yes, of course! 
OK, I'll pick you up at your room. 
A shrine visit with Sakura… That'll be fun! 
I'm busy unfortunately… 
By the way, Sakura… Did you want anything? 
Sakura… What is it with her? She seemed upset… 
Hey, Sumire. What's up? 
OK, let's go! <br> Sorry, I can't. 
OK, let's go! But Manager Yoneda just called me… 
I'll pick you up at your room afterwards, so the others don't notice. 
OK, please wait in your room. 
Sorry, I can't. Manager Yoneda called me, and… 
… 
Sorry, Sumire… 
Oh, Maria… What's up? 
Sure, let's go together. <br> I'm kind of busy… 
Sure, let's go together. I'm happy you asked. 
Unfortunately manager Yoneda wanted to speak with me… 
Please wait in your room, Maria. I'll come pick you up. 
Sorry, but manager Yoneda wanted to speak with me. 
Maybe that was a little too harsh… 
Oh, Kohran? What's with the long face? 
It's just… I was taking care of the Koubu, and we've got a little problem. 
Problem? 
The Koubu… Even though we call them "Spirit Armor", they're not indestructible. At some point, they'll break. 
The Koubu are pretty beat up after the fight against the Hive of Darkness… 
In my professional opinion, they won't stand another big fight like that. 
What!? So if we keep being attacked… 
Well, they haven't shown themselves for some time now, and we can just pray it stays that way. 
I also asked the Hanayashiki about the Koubu, so you'll have to be patient until we figure something out. 
…OK. Thank you, Kohran. 
… 
I'd love to. <br> No time, sorry… 
I'd love to. Let me pick you up at your room later. 
If we tell everyone, there'll surely be trouble, so let's keep quiet about it. 
No time, sorry… Manager Yoneda wanted to see me. 
Oh dear… Looks like I made her angry. 
Hey, Iris. What's up? 
Sure, let's go together! <br> Sorry, I have other plans. 
Sure, let's go together! I'll show you how we celebrate the New Year in Japan. 
Manager Yoneda wanted to see me however, so I can't right now. 
Just wait in your room, I'll come meet you as soon as I'm ready. 
Sorry, I have other plans. Manager Yoneda wanted to see me. 
Sorry, Iris. What do you want me to do? 
I'm really sorry! And… she's gone. 
Hey, Kanna. What's up? 
Great! Let's go together! <br> I'm busy unfortunately… 
Great! Let's go together! A Japanese New Year wouldn't be complete without a shrine visit. 
But I can't go right away. Manager Yoneda wanted to see me. 
I'll come meet you later. Just wait in your room. 
No time, sorry… Manager Yoneda wanted to see me. 
What!? That's… 
I have to go Yoneda now… Sorry, Kanna! 
Ogami, reporting for duty. 
There you are! Come in! 
Yes, sir! 
Why did you want to see me, manager? 
Good to see you, Ogami! But first things first - a drink? 
Cheers! <br> …I'll have to decline. <br> Please tell my why I'm here. 
Cheers! After all, what's New Year's Day without some booze? 
…You idiot! 
…Y-yes? 
…Don't get carried away by your New Year's spirit. 
"In prosperity, prepare for adversary." If you haven't mastered that, you're not fit to be a captain. 
…I'm sorry. 
With all due respect… I'll have to decline. 
Right. You probably should. 
"In prosperity, prepare for adversary." If you haven't mastered that, you're not fit to be a captain, you know. 
Yes. 
Please tell my why I'm here. 
Why are you in such a hurry, Ogami? Very suspicious… 
Haha! You're itching to go meet the girls, aren't you? 
I… no, it's… 
Wahahaha! Seems like I hit the mark! 
But remember, "In prosperity, prepare for adversary." Even in times of peace, we can't let our guard down. 
Yes. 
Attention, man! What's with that gone fishing face!? 
Oh… sorry. 
New Year's Eve really did a number on you, huh? 
"In prosperity, prepare for adversary." If you haven't mastered that, you're not fit to be a captain. 
…I'm sorry. 
…That said, I guess it's only natural that you want to relax a little on New Year's Day. 
Anyway, you don't have to work today. Catch some fresh air or something. 
Y-yes, sir! 
OK, I'm off then. 
Catch some fresh air… That's some good advice, even though it came from Yoneda. 
OK! I'll take it easy for once! 
Ayame… 
The manager gave me permission to go out, so I wanted to do just that… 
Yes, and… er… 
Come to the shrine with me? <br> So, see you around. 
Ayame… Would you… like to go to the shrine with me? 
A-all right… 
I see… 
Ye-yes, ma'am…… 
… 
Whom should I ask out to go to the shrine? 
Please excuse me! 
Huh!? 
… 
… 
Whom should I ask out to go to the shrine? 
I wonder if Sakura is in her room… 
Maybe I should go to another room. 
It's Ogami… Are you in, Sakura? 
Wow… Beautiful! 
Yes, of course. <br> No, I was talking about you. 
Yes, of course. That's perfect for New Year's Day. 
OK, should we get going? Let's take the steam train to Meiji Shrine. 
No, I was talking about you. 
No, I really mean it… 
OK, should we get going? Let's take the steam train to Meiji Shrine. 
…? 
S-sorry. I was admiring your long-sleeved kimono… 
OK, should we get going? Let's take the steam train to Meiji Shrine. 
It's me, Ogami… Are you in, Sakura? 
Ogami? Come in, the door is open! 
Come in, door's open! 
Pardon me. 
Sakura… I… 
What is it this time? 
Sakura… I… 
Visit the shrine with me? <br> …It's nothing. 
Do you want to go visit the shrine with me? 
Together with you, you mean? 
Sorry, but I… 
I… I see… 
I'm not saying I don't want to go with you! 
It's just… I never walked around like that with a man. I'd be embarrassed… 
I see… That's too bad. 
…Sorry. 
It's a pity, but what can you do? I'll leave you to it then. 
Looks like Sakura blew me off… 
I guess I'll just ask someone else. 
Sakura… Please come to the shrine with me. 
I know I cut you off earlier… But I really, really want to go with you. 
Yes, of course! 
OK. In one hour, in front of the theater. 
Visiting the shrine with Sakura… I couldn't think of a better way to start off the new year. 
It's a little early, but maybe I should already wait in front of the theater. 
It's… No, it's nothing. 
What is it, Ogami? Did you have too much of that New Year's sake? 
Cut it out! New Year's Day or not, that's in bad taste. 
S-sorry. I'll see myself out. 
Hm… Whom should I ask to visit the shrine with me? 
I wonder if Sumire is in her room. 
Maybe I should go to another room. 
It's me, Ogami… Are you there, Sumire? 
Sorry to keep you waiting, Ensign. Let us leave. 
Oh? Aren't you going to wear the dress from before? 
Well… I got worried I'd stand out too much in such a crowd… 
I didn't want that to get in the way when we finally spend some time together. 
You're right. <br> I liked the other one better. <br> …you'll still stand out. 
You're right. Let's just enjoy New Year's Day together, the two of us. 
Yes… I have a feeling this will be an excellent year! 
OK, should we leave? I guess Meiji Shrine is the place to go. 
To be honest, I liked the other one better. 
Does it matter? My beauty shines no matter what I wear. 
It may be a new year, but you haven't changed at all. 
OK, should we leave? I guess Meiji Shrine is the place to go. 
…I think you'll still stand out. 
Why, that's not because of the dress. 
I just stand out because of my beauty. I can't help it. 
It may be a new year, but you haven't changed at all. 
OK, should we leave? I guess Meiji Shrine is the place to go. 
Do you want to stand around there until the sun sets? 
Y-you're right. Should we leave? I guess Meiji Shrine is the place to go. 
It's me, Ogami… Are you there, Sumire? 
Ensign? Please do come in! 
What is it, all of a sudden? Just come in, it's open. 
Coming in! 
Hm? What happened to the other dress? 
I was just about to leave to visit the shrine… 
I figured I'd stand out too much, so I changed. 
(I think she'll still stand out…) 
By the way, what did you want? 
Really, Ensign… If you want something from me, can't you tell me right away? 
Sumire, listen… 
Visit the shrine with me? <br> …It's nothing. 
Would you… come visit the shrine with me? 
I'm sorry, but tonight I have to be at the Kanzaki estate. 
Show my face at some boring party… You know how it is. 
I see… That's too bad. 
…Sorry. 
It's a pity, but what can you do? I'll leave you to it then. 
Looks like Sumire blew me off… 
I guess I'll just ask someone else. 
Would you come visit the shrine with me? 
I know you said you were busy, but… I don't want to go with anyone else. 
Wha… with me? Are you serious, Ensign? 
Yes, of course! 
Thank you for asking. I would gladly join you! 
Phew… I'm glad! I'd have been really sad if you'd said no. 
Very well, we should leave at once! Time is of the essence. 
OK, perfect. Let's go to Meiji Shrine then. 
It's… No, it's nothing. 
Are you all right, Ensign? Did the New Year already do a number on you? 
Please be serious, Ensign! New Year's Day or not, that's just rude! 
S-sorry. I'll see myself out. 
Hm… Whom should I ask to visit the shrine with me? 
I wonder if Maria is in her room. 
Maybe I should go to another room. 
It's me, Ogami… Are you there, Maria? 
Sorry to keep you waiting, Ensign. Shall we go? 
Yes. We fought hard for this peace. So let's enjoy it for once. 
Y-yes… 
…Maria? 
Let's leave soon. <br> …What is it? 
Let's leave soon. I wouldn't want to miss out on the fun. 
You're right, let's go. 
It's just… It's almost too peaceful. It freaks me out. 
Hahaha, you're a worry-wart, Maria. The Hive of Darkness is done. There's nothing to worry about. 
I hope you're right… 
Come on. I guess Meiji Shrine is the place to go. 
…What is it? 
It's just… It's almost too peaceful. It freaks me out. 
Being worried about nothing… I guess that's not really a healthy way of thinking. 
Hahaha, you're a worry-wart, Maria. The Hive of Darkness is done. There's nothing to worry about. 
I hope you're right… 
Come on. I guess Meiji Shrine is the place to go. 
Oh… Sorry. Let's go 
It's just… It's almost too peaceful. It freaks me out. 
It's strange to be worried now, when we've defeated the Hive of Darkness, isn't it? 
Exactly. We fought hard for this peace, so let's enjoy it for once. 
Come on. I guess Meiji Shrine is the place to go. 
It's me, Ogami… Are you there, Maria? 
Captain? Please, come in. 
Come in, the door isn't locked. 
Coming in! 
Hey, Maria. I wanted to ask… Are you busy? 
I was just reading a book, I don't really have any other plans yet. 
I'd like to continue reading, so would you mind telling me what you want now? 
It's just… I… 
Come visit the shrine with me. <br> …Never mind. 
Come visit the shrine with me. What do you say? 
I'm sorry, but I'll have to decline that offer. 
It's just… Even though it's New Year's Day, I feel a strange sense of unease. 
One more reason to visit the shrine. To take your mind off things. 
Thank you for your concern. 
But I'm really not in the mood for something like that right now. 
I see… 
Please forgive me, Captain. 
Looks like Maria blew me off… 
I guess I'll just ask someone else. 
Maria… Please come to the shrine with me. 
I know I cut you off earlier, but… I don't want to go with anyone else. 
With me… Are you sure? 
Of course. If it isn't too much trouble… 
Trouble? Not at all, I'd gladly join you! 
Phew… I'm glad! I'd have been really sad if you'd said no. 
This is my first New Year's shrine visit. I'd be happy to go with you. 
Trust me, it'll be fine! Should we take the Steam Train to Meiji Shrine then? 
It's… No, it's nothing. 
If there's nothing else, could you let me continue reading? 
You must be really bored, Captain. What is it this time? 
S-sorry. I'll see myself out. 
Hm… Whom should I ask to visit the shrine with me? 
I wonder if Kanna is in her room. 
Maybe I should go to another room. 
It's me, Ogami… Are you there, Kanna? 
Hey, Boss! Here I am! 
I also got permission to go out from Manager Yoneda. 
Really? Glad to hear it! Even you like to relax on a day like this, right? 
I want to eat a lot, have a lot of fun… and then sleep a lot! 
Hahaha, that's just like you, Kanna! You know what they say - your first dream of the year comes true. 
It'll come true…? 
What kind of dream would you want to have, Boss? 
Of a peaceful Tokyo. <br> Of you, Kanna. <br> I’ll surely have a nightmare. 
Of a peaceful Tokyo. Even with the Hive of Darkness gone, this city still hasn't fully recovered. 
I want everything rebuilt, so the people can forget what happened and live in peace. 
It's not just a dream I have while I'm sleeping. It's the same when I'm awake. 
Not bad, Boss. You really have a good heart. 
But we defeated the Hive of Darkness, so who'd attack the Flower Division? Aren't you worrying too much? 
OK, wanna leave? I just want to get out of here. 
I'd dream of you, Kanna. How we go visit the shrine together. 
Oh, stop it… You'll make me blush! That would be some nightmare. 
No, that's about the most pleasant dream I could imagine right now. 
… 
Thanks, Boss… I guess dreaming of you… wouldn't be so bad either. 
Huh? What did you say just now? 
Erm, I mean… Let's go to the shrine then! 
I'll have a nightmare for sure. I can feel it in my bones already. 
That's depressing, Boss! Let's not start the New Year like that. 
You gotta have a nice dream that'll take your mind off things. You just gotta try hard! 
Hahaha! Having nice dreams by sheer willpower? Typical Kanna! 
Starting the year with a lot of energy is important! Now let's go out there and go wild! 
Hahaha! Don't know what to say to that, huh? Don't worry. 
After all, some people think that it won't come true if you tell others about it. 
Hmmm… 
Than let's leave it at that and just enjoy our shrine visit! 
All right. Let's get out of here. 
It's me, Ogami… Are you there, Kanna? 
That you, Boss? Just come in! 
I'll give you one thing, you're persistent. 
Coming in! 
So, what's up? 
By the way… Did you want anything in particular? 
Listen… 
Come visit the shrine with me. <br> …Never mind. 
Would you maybe… join me for visiting the shrine? 
With me? Oh, stop it! That's not for me. 
I'm sure there's someone else you could ask who'd be better suited to go with you. 
Just invite that person. But thanks for asking me, anyway. I appreciate the feeling. 
I see… 
Looks like Kanna blew me off… 
I guess I'll just ask someone else. 
Would you maybe… join me for visiting the shrine? 
I know I cut you off earlier, but… I don't want to go with anyone else. 
Huh? With me? You serious, Boss? 
Of course. I wouldn't joke about something like that. 
Thanks, Boss. That really makes me happy. 
If you really wanna go with me, how could I say no? 
Wow, that's great! Let's go as soon as possible! 
Yeah. OK, let's go! 
It's… No, it's nothing. 
You're acting weird, Boss. Did you maybe have a little too much of that New Year's sake? 
Come on! If you want something, just get it out the first time! 
S-sorry. I'll see myself out. 
Hm… Whom should I ask to visit the shrine with me? 
I wonder if Iris is in her room. 
Maybe I should go to another room. 
It's me, Ogami… Are you there, Iris? 
Are you ready, Mon Frère? 
Yep. Yoneda gave me permission to go out. I can do what I want all day! 
Yaaay! We're going to visit the shrine together! I'm so happy! 
Oh, right… I wanted to ask you something, Frère. 
What is it? 
What… do we do at the shrine? 
We go there to make wishes. <br> We go there to draw omikuji. <br> To have fun at the stalls. 
We go there to make wishes for the New Year. 
Health, good grades, money… People wish for all kinds of things. Love, too, of course… 
OK, I've got it! I decided what I'll wish for at the shrine! 
Oh, really? Wanna tell me what it is? 
Not telling! Come on now, let's go already! 
We go there to draw omikuji. 
Omi… what? 
That's right… You're from France, so you wouldn't know. 
Omikuji are strips of paper we draw to have our fortune told. They have words like "Kichi" or "Kyo" on them. 
Mon Frère… 
What does that mean, "Kichi" and "Kyo"? 
You know what? It's easier if we just go there and I show you. 
We go there to have fun at the stalls. 
Yay, that sounds fun! I love stalls! 
Oh… So you know about festival stalls? 
Yeah! I saw them when I went with the others to visit a traditional festival! 
Let's go, Mon Frère! Let's go! 
Hahaha, all right! After you! 
Hey, Mon Frère! Why are you spacing out? Let's go! 
Hey, Iris! Don't pull my arm like that! 
Come on, or I'll leave you behind! 
It's me, Ogami… Are you there, Iris? 
Mon Frère? Come in! The door is open! 
Yay, you're back! 
The door isn't locked, so just come in! 
Coming in! 
What is it, Mon Frère? 
What do you want this time? 
Listen… 
Come visit the shrine with me. <br> …Never mind. 
Iris… Do you want to go visit the shrine with me? 
The shrine? What would we want to do there? 
I see… You don't know about that yet. 
At the beginning of a New Year, we always go visit the shrine. 
But… why? 
Why!? Well… 
Hm… Japanese people really have lots of annoying customs… 
The temple bell wouldn't stop ringing yesterday… 
So now, I'm super sleepy! I want to take a nap… 
Oh, I see… Too bad. 
It's nice you asked me though… Sorry, Mon Frère. 
Iris blew me off… 
I guess I'll just ask someone else. 
Iris… Do you want to go visit the shrine with me? 
I know I cut you off earlier, but… I don't want to go with anyone else. 
OK, let's go! I'll go to the shrine with you, Mon Frère! 
Hahaha, I love how enthusiastic you sound. Then let's go visit Meiji Shrine! 
OK, let's go then! With you, I'd go anywhere, Mon Frère! 
Hahaha, that's nice. Should we get going? 
Yeah! 
It's… No, it's nothing. 
You're being strange, Mon Frère. What's the matter? 
You keep acting strange. What's up, Mon Frère? 
S-sorry. I'll see myself out. 
Hm… Whom should I ask to visit the shrine with me? 
I wonder if Kohran is in her room. 
Maybe I should go to another room. 
It's Ogami… Are you there, Kohran? 
Look who's up early! Did you finish talking to Yoneda, boss? 
Yeah. He said I could go out and do whatever I want. 
Perfect! Should we go there on my steam bike? 
That sounds fun! <br> …Are you sure it's safe? 
That sounds fun! Can I ride, too? 
Of course! I improved the engine, so it's even faster than before! 
Let's go already! …By the way, which shrine did you have in mind? 
How about Meiji Shrine? 
All righty! 
…Are you sure it's safe? I mean, with two people on it? 
Ah, no problem! You can pilot a Koubu, so you'll manage my little bike. 
…Well, I guess you're right. But please don't go too fast. 
OK! 
Come on, no dilly-dallying! 
Wa-wa-wait! Don't pull me like that, Kohran! 
It's Ogami… Are you there, Kohran? 
That you, Chief? Come in, door's open! 
How many times do I have to tell you? If it's open, you can come right in! 
Pardon me. 
So, what's up, Chief? Can I help you with anything? 
I'm a little busy, you know. If you want something, keep it snappy. 
Listen… 
Come visit the shrine with me. <br> …Never mind. 
Kohran, I wonder… Do you want to go visit the shrine with me? 
What? You want to go with me? 
Hmm… I'd love to go, but… there's something I need to check. 
What are you talking about? 
The Koubu… Even though we call them "Spirit Armor", they're not indestructible. At some point, they'll break. 
The Koubu are pretty beat up after the fight against the Hive of Darkness… 
In my professional opinion, they won't stand another big fight like that. 
What!? It can't be that bad, right…? 
Well, no need to get dramatic. We did manage to smash the Hive to pieces. 
I just wanted to get in touch with Hanayashiki one of these days. 
And that's why you should ask someone else to go visit the shrine with you. I'm afraid I can't. 
I see… That's too bad. 
I hope you get to have fun! 
Looks like Kohran blew me off… 
I guess I'll just ask someone else. 
Kohran… How about visiting the shrine with me? 
I know I cut you off earlier, but… I don't want to go with anyone else. 
Visit the shrine… with me!? 
Probably not, right…? 
What are you saying… Of course! Of course I'll go with you! 
Phew… I'm glad! I'd have been really sad if you'd said no. 
Great! We can go there on my Steam Bike! 
Steam Bike!? Ah, that thing that blew up when you first arrived here? 
It's… No, it's nothing. 
Come on, Chief. Are you still asleep? 
I'm busy right now. If there's nothing you want, could you please give me some space? 
Sorry Chief, but I'm busy. If you're bored, go somewhere else. 
S-sorry. I'll see myself out. 
Hm… Whom should I ask to visit the shrine with me? 
Oh, Ogami! Still loitering around here? 
Y-yes, ma'am…… 
Get a grip! As leader of the Flower Division, you can't behave like that anymore. 
Y-yes, ma'am! 
Come now, invite someone and have fun at the shrine. Don't waste your youth in my office. 
Ogami… Still loitering around here? 
Get a grip, man! If you keep wasting time here, it'll be too late to go out. 
Y-yes! Please excuse me. 
Three months later. Taisho 13 (1924), 1st of January. 
Happy New Year! 
Ogami! Happy New Year!

I'll do my best to make it a great year! And, er… 
No! It's nothing! 
You were always there for me last year. Thank you for everything! 
Sakura! I didn't expect such a well-mannered greeting from you! 
Thank you. I'll try hard this year to be a proper lady like you, Sumire! 
Ohohohoho… Seems like you have finally seen the light!

Captain… Happy New Year. 
Yo, Chief! Chinese New Year is still a few weeks off though… 
You look much older already! 
Happy New Year, Mon Frère! 
I'll be eleven this year! How long do you think until I can get married? 
Oh, really? 
You've come a long way as a captain! I have a feeling we've got an awesome year ahead of us. 
Like you would know anything about that… 
How dare you, you evil hag! 
Stop your screaming, gorilla! 
Want to pick a fight, you rotten snake? 
Ogami… You did well last year. Keep it up! 
Chief… You've been acting bashful all day!

You and me, let's get out of here and enjoy our shrine visit together. 
That makes me happy! Let's get out of here right away. 
Just kidding! Hohohoho… How innocent you are! 
Unused
All right, just what I wanted to hear! Let's get out of here! 
Hahaha! All right, let's drink and be merry! Right? 
I really like you, Chief. Come on then, show me how you celebrate New Year's Day in Tokyo. Just the two of us! 
This is our little secret… OK, let's go!

Hey, Mon Frère… Take me to the shrine please! 
Just the two of us, having fun. Hehehe… Wouldn't that be nice?

Sorry you had to wait! 
You mean this dress? 
I wanted to dress in a real Japanese kimono. New Year's Day only comes once a year, after all! 
And also… It's my first date with you, Ogami. 
Even if you're only flattering me, that makes me happy. 
Thank you, really.

You should work hard and follow my example so you can make your debut in high society. 
By the way, Ogami, what do you think about this dress? Isn't it a little too plain? 
Hmph… I was planning to make it from Nishijin brocade imported from Kyoto… 
I wanted to wear a luxurious long-sleeved kimono. Such a pity… 
Yeah, yeah… Suits you perfectly, Sumire, like always. 
Do I detect some sarcasm in your tone? 
Ahahaha, what gave you that idea? I was being honest! Wasn't I, Chief? 
Why the sudden silence, Ogami?! 
Indecisive as ever! 
But I'm right, aren't I? Whatever you're wearing, it always suits you! 
Ooooohohohoho! Looks like you finally learned to appreciate my beauty. 
So, Ogami… If you're going to visit the shrine, I could accompany you. 
You don't look very busy to me, Chief! Come on… Let's celebrate New Year's Day, just the two of us! 
What!? You gonna turn me down, Chief? 
That's just… I hate you! To play with my feelings like that… 
Boohoo… I hate you, Frère! So you don't like me after all! 
Captain… Would you like to take me to the shrine? 
In my country, we didn't have this custom… 
Oh, really? I understand. 
Really? I'll come by your room later then. 
Ogami? What's up? 
What? With me? 
A New Year's shrine visit with you… Hehe, that doesn't sound so bad. 
But… I'm sorry. I can't really leave my post right now. 
Just take one of the girls. Didn't some of them ask you already? 
Everyone wanted to go with you. 
You shouldn't let them wait too long. 
Oh, and one more thing… "He who runs after two hares will catch neither". Keep that in mind. 
Hehe, why not? It's only New Year's Day once a year, so let's get a little crazy. 
Take care of the girls! Don't mess this up, Ogami.
