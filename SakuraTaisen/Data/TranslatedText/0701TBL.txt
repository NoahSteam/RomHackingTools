﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿It's a photo of Sakura. She's looking right at me. I wonder what she's thinking…
It's a photo of Sumire. This is a side of her you don't see too often. 
It's a photo of Maria. She's lost in thought and looks kind of sad… 
It's a photo of Kanna. Her signature strength comes through clearly.
It's a photo of Iris. She's surrounded by flowers and flashing a radiant smile. 
It's a photo of Kohran. She's looking pretty in profile with her face dyed red by the evening sun. 
A letter given to me by a customer. I was asked to give it to Sumire. I have a bad feeling about this…
Maria's pistol. This may help me escape from here…
A hair ornament. It's decorated with flowers and looks very elegant. 
A pretty pendant. The delicate workmanship is gorgeous.
A hairpin for use in a traditional bun hairstyle. It would complement a formal outfit well. 
Jean-Paul the teddy bear. Iris's best friend. She always carries him with her and takes good care of him. 
This key will let me enter rooms I couldn't before. 
I found this in a bedroom on the second floor. I can use it to access the back room. 
A set of cups Iris asked me to get for her. They have a very stylish design.
This is the matchbox Iris asked for. Its logo is quite colorful. 
Some knives Iris asked me to get for her. Just a normal utensil you'd use during a meal.
A prop sword and shield used onstage. They're well-made and look just like the real thing. 
A prop crown used onstage. It's well-constructed and incredibly detailed. 
A wig and costume used onstage. I wonder what kind of act could use a flashy outfit like this? 
It's a photo of Sakura in her swimsuit. Wow, this is really something. I'm gonna treasure this. 
It's a photo of Sumire in her stage costume. Her distinctive makeup really makes an impact. 
It's a photo of Maria on stage in military uniform from "For Love"… She's a beautiful woman disguised as a man. 
It's a photo of Kanna in her training gear. Catching her in a private moment like this feels surprisingly intimate. 
It's a photo of Iris in her swimsuit. She's holding a rubber ring and looks ready to have some fun. How cute. 
It's a photo of Kohran. I don't get to see her with her braids undone very often. It's a nice look. 
It's a photo of Ayame in a traditional outfit. I hope she'll always be as happy and content as she is here. 
Ayame's gun. Why…? Why did it have to turn out like this…? 
Sakura! Thank God you regained consciousness! 
Ogami… Sorry, I'm late. 
Not at all! We escaped from the clutches of death thanks to you… 
It looks like I was unconscious… I thought I'd never be able to open my eyes again. 
I-I'm just so glad. So glad I could be of use to you, and so glad I could talk with you again like this. 
Sakura… 
O-Ogami… I… 
Ah! It's Sakura! Everyone, Sakura is here! Come quickly! 
…Looks like we've been found out. Just when the two of us were finally alone. 
We were able to make it out just by a hair's breadth. Thank goodness all of us are safe! 
Ah! It's Sakura! Everyone, Sakura is here! Come quickly! 
Iris… Everyone! 
Thank heavens, Sakura is all right! With this, the whole Flower Division is together again! 
I knew Sakura wouldn't go down without a fight. You were actually just resting weren't you? 
Seriously… Always making us worry! 
But… Sakura, how did you regain consciousness? 
Uh… I was actually having a dream. 
A dream…? 
What kind of a dream? <br> Weren't you cold? 
What kind of a dream was it? 
More importantly, you were sleeping naked… Weren't you cold? 
Jeez… Ogami! Don't tease me! Aren't you embarrassed? 
Now that you mention it, Ogami… You were staring at Sakura quite intently. 
O-Ogami?! 
N-No, that's not true… Ayame, you’re gonna get me in trouble saying stuff like that. 
Heheh… Sorry. 
Hey, Sakura. What kind of a dream did you have? 
Hey, Sakura. What kind of a dream did you have? 
Uh… It was nostalgic and warm… but mysterious too. 
Demons sealed behind a… gate?! 
What?! Sakura! What did you just say? 
Y-Yes… The Hive’s base is located above a gate that seals an ancient evil… 
Do you know something about this, Commander Yoneda? 
Yeah… 
Five years ago, a battle called the “Kouma War" took place… 
The Kouma…War… 
On one side was the Kouma, an ancient force of demons. On the other was the military's Anti-Kouma Corps. 
I established the special unit with my old comrade Kazuma Shinguji, gathering the elite of the military’s infantry. 
Shinnosuke Yamazaki was also with us, the creator of the Koubu and the Soaring Whale. 
… 
And of course, Ayame Fujieda was a member of the unit, who's with us now. It was just the four of us. 
Five years ago, we fought the Kouma, who appeared in great numbers. That was the Kouma War. 
We, the Anti-Kouma Corps, used an ancient spell. 
Thus, we managed to seal the Kouma deep in the earth under the capital. 
But we paid a hefty price… 
The Kouma War… I had never heard of it before. 
Ogami… You look like you have many questions. 
The Anti-Kouma Corps? <br> An ancient spell? <br> Kazuma Shinguji? 
The Anti-Kouma Corps? <br> An ancient spell? 
The Anti-Kouma Corps? <br> Kazuma Shinguji? 
The Anti-Kouma Corps? 
An ancient spell? <br> Kazuma Shinguji? 
An ancient spell? 
Kazuma Shinguji? 
The Anti-Kouma Corps… What kind of an outfit was it? 
We didn't have the Koubu back then. We were just a group of warriors who fought the Kouma with our swords. 
It was the predecessor of the Imperial Assault Troupe. 
An ancient spell…? Are you serious? 
I'm afraid so, yes. Horrifying magic, it was… 
It grants the power to seal the demons in exchange for the life of the spellcaster. 
Kazuma Shinguji…? That means, he was… 
Exactly. Sakura's father. 
Five years ago… Yes… Father returned home with terrible wounds… 
Kazuma Shinguji was a fine man, but he made a terrible mistake. 
No… I'm sure he knew what would happen and chose to do it anyway. 
I hadn't realized… 
So your father fought the Kouma, and now you're in the same situation as him… 
I don't know what to say. That's a cruel twist of fate. 
It must have been the purifying blood in Sakura's veins that revealed the enemy's location in her dream. 
Purifying blood…? 
The bloodline of demon hunters, carried since ancient times by the Shinguji family. 
In today's Japan, there are hardly any of them left. 
The light Sakura was emitting when we were trapped underground… Maybe that was due to her bloodline as well. 
The "gate in which the demons are sealed" that Sakura mentioned… 
That must be the location of the seal where the Kouma were imprisoned five years ago. 
And now it’s the very center of the Hive of Darkness' magical force field… Nihonbashi! 
Nihonbashi! 
Yes, Nihonbashi… 
Without any doubt! 
Looks like the big finale is upon us! I can't wait! 
The epic decisive battle! 
If we win this fight… we won't have to fight ever again! 
Are you all ready? 
Ogami! Please give the dispatch order! 
Flower Division, to battle! <br> We'll return, no matter what! 
Imperial Assault Troupe, Flower Division, get ready for battle! Board the Koubu and prepare for dispatch! 
Roger! We'll board the Koubu and await drop orders! 
OK! Commander Yoneda! 
Very well! Bring the Soaring Whale in on our target, right above Nihonbashi! 
As soon as we reach the target, dispatch all Koubu! 
Yes, sir! Full turn to Starboard! Target: Nihonbashi! 
This will be our final battle. But don't even think about sacrificing yourselves. We'll all come back, no matter what! 
Yes, sir! 
Roger! 
OK! 
Second that! 
Please, Leave it to me! 
Captain, no matter what… let's come back home without fail! 
… 
…This will be our final battle. But I don't really have anything special to say. 
Let's just do what we always do… win, and then all meet here again! 
That's right. The tragedy of the Kouma War must never be repeated. 
If you all come back safe and sound… only that's a real victory! 
Just you wait, Hive of Darkness! Prepare yourself, Tenkai! 
We won't waver! Vanquish evil and lead good to victory… that's the Imperial Assault Troupe!
