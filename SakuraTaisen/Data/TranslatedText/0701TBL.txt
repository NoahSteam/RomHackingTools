It's a photo of Sakura. He's looking this way intently. Wonder what he's thinking about....
It's a photo of Sumire. Although he doesn't normally show it, but he's capable of making such an expression too.
It's a photo of Maria. ...She's lost in thought and looks kind of sad...
A photo of Kanna. Kanna's signature strength comes through clearly. 
A photo of Iris. She's surrounded by flowers and flashing a radiant smile.
A photo of Kohran. She's looking pretty in profile with her face dyed red by the evening sun.
The letter from the customer. I was told to hand it over to Sumire-kun....hmm..
Maria's gun.n....Isn't there any way I can use this to escape?
A hair ornament. It's decorated with flowers and looks very elegant.
A brooch. It's a beautiful piece of delicate craftsmanship.
A hairpin for use in a traditional bun hairstyle. It would complement a formal outfit well.
Jean-Paul the teddy bear. Iris's best friend. She always carries him with her and takes good care of him.
This key will let me enter rooms I couldn't before.
I found this in a bedroom on the second floor. I can use it to access the back room.
A teacup Iris asked me to get for her. It has a very stylish design.
This is the matchbox Iris asked for. Its logo is quite colorful.
A knife Iris asked me to get for her. Just a normal utensil you'd use during a meal.
A prop sword and shield used onstage. They're well-made and look just like the real thing.
A prop crown used onstage. It's well-constructed and incredibly detailed.
A wig and costume used onstage. I wonder what kind of act could use a flashy outfit like this?
A photo of Sakura in her swimsuit. Wow, this is really something. I'm gonna treasure this.
A photo of Sumire in her stage costume. Her distinctive makeup really makes an impact.
It's a photo of Maria on stage in the military uniform from "For Love"... She's a beautiful woman disguised as a man. 
A photo of Kanna in her training gear. Catching her in a private moment like this feels surprisingly intimate.
A photo of Iris in her swimsuit. She's holding a rubber ring and looks ready to have some fun. How cute.
A photo of Kohran. I don't get to see her with her braids undone very often. It's a nice look.
A photo of Ayame in a traditional outfit. I hope she'll always be as happy and content as she is here.
Ayame's gun. Why...? Why did it have to turn out like this...?
Sakura! Thank god you regained consciousness..!
Ogami-san... Sorry, I'm late.
Not at all! We escaped from the clutches of death thanks to you...
I..it looks like I was unconscious. Thought I'd never be able to open my eyes again.
That is... I've become used to used to your power.. that's why I can talk to you like this..
Sakura...
O,Ogami-san...I....
Ah! It's Sakura! Everyone, Sakura is here! Come quickly!
...Looks like we've been found out. Just... when the two of us were finally alone.
We were able to make it out just by a hair's breadth. Thank god all of us are safe!
Ah! It's Sakura! Everyone, Sakura is here! Come quickly!
Iris... everyone!
Thank god, Sakura! With this, the whole of flower division is safe and here!
I knew Sakura wouldn't go down with just that much. You were actually just resting weren't you?
Seriously... Always making us worry
But...Sakura, you, how did you get your consciousness back?
Uh...I, was actually having a dream.
A dream...?
What kind of a dream?<br>Weren't you feeling cold without any clothes on?
What kind of a dream was it?
More importantly, You were sleeping naked... weren't you cold?
Geez.... Ogami-san! Don't tease me! Aren't you embarrassed?
Now that you mention it, Ogami... You were staring at Sakura quite intently.
Mr... Mr. Ogami?!
N-No, that's no true... Ayame-san, don't tease and trouble me.
Hehe... Sorry.
Hey, Sakura. What kind of a dream was it?
Hey, Sakura. What kind of a dream was it?
Uh... It was nostalgic and warm... but mysterious too.
A demon sealed behind a....gate?!
What?! Sakura! What did you just say?
Ye-yes... There was a demon sealed behind a gate...and..
Isn't this some sort of a misunderstanding, Commander?
Yeah...
Five years ago, a battle called "The demonic war" took place..
Demonic...war...
On the one side Koma, an ancient evil. On the other, the special Anti-Demon Unit of the Imperial infantry.
I established it with my old comrade Kazuma Jinguji, gathering the elite of the infantry.
Shinnosuke Kanzaki was also with us, the creator of the Kobu and the Shogeimaru.
...
And of course, Ayame Fujieda, who's with us now. It was just the four of us.
Five years ago, we fought the Koma, who appeared in great numbers. That were the Koma Wars.
We, the Imperial Anti-Demon Unit, used an ancient spell.
Thus, we managed to seal the Koma deep in the earth under Teito.
But we payed a hefty price...
The Koma Wars... I never heard of it before.
Ogami... You look like you have many questions.
The Imperial Anti-Demon Unit...?nAn ancient spell...?nKazuma Jinguji...?
The Imperial Anti-Demon Unit...?nAn ancient spell...?
The Imperial Anti-Demon Unit...?nKazuma Jinguji...?
The Imperial Anti-Demon Unit...?
An ancient spell...?nKazuma Jinguji...?
An ancient spell...?
Kazuma Jinguji...?
The Imperial Anti-Demon Unit... What kind of an outfit was it?
We didn't have the Kobu back then. We were just a group of warriors who fought the demons with our swords.
It was the predecessor of the Imperial Floral Storm Troop.
An ancient spell...? Are you serious?
I'm afraid yes. Horrifying magic, it was...
It grants the power to seal the demons in exchange for the life of the spellcaster.
Kazuma Jinguji...? That means, he was...
Exactly. Sakura's father.
Five years ago... Yes... Father returned home with terrible wounds...
Kazuma Jinguji was a fine man, but he made a terrible mistake.
No... I'm sure he knew what would happen and chose to do it anyway.
I hadn't realized...
So your father fought the demons, and now you're in the same situation as him...
I don't know what to say. That's a cruel twist of fate.
It must have been the purifying blood in Sakura's veins that showed us the enemy base in her dreams.
Purifying blood...?
The blood line of demon hunters, carried since ancient times by the Jinguji family.
In today's Japan, there are hardly any of them left.
The light Sakura was emitting when she was captured underground... Maybe that was the same power.
The "gate that seals the demons" that Sakura felt...
That must be the the location of the seal where the demons were emprisoned five years ago.
And now the very center of the Black Web's magical force field... Nihonbashi!
Nihonbashi!
Yes, Nihonbashi...
Without any doubt!
Looks like the big finale is upon as! I can't wait!
The big decisive battle!
If we win this fight... We won't have to fight ever again!
Are you all ready?
Mr. Ogami! Please give the dispatch order!
Flower Division, get ready for battle!<br>We'll come back, no matter what!
Imperial Floral Storm Troop, Flower Division, get ready for battle! Board the Kobu and prepare for dispatch!
Roger! We'll board the Kobu and await drop orders!
Okay! Lt. Gen. Yoneda!
Very well! Bring the Shogeimaru in on our target: right above Nihonbashi!
As soon as we reach target, dispatch all Kobu!
Yes, sir! Full turn to Starboard! Target: Nihonbashi!
This will be our final battle. But don't even think about sacrificing yourselves. We'll come back, no matter what!
Yessir!
Roger!
Okay!
Second that!
Please, Leave it to me!
Commander, definitely... let's come back home without fail!
...
...This will be our final battle. But I don't really have anything special to say.
Let's just do what we always do... Win, and then all meet here again!
That's right. The tragedy of the Koma Wars must never be repeated.
If you all come back safe and sound... Only that's a real victory!
Just you wait, Black Web! Prepare yourself, Tenkai!
We won't waver! Vanquish evil and lead good to victory... That's the Imperial Floral Storm Troop!
Waaaaah!
Commander! It's Sakura...
Ugh... Aaaaaah!
Hmph... So this is the Six Star Summoning...
Hahahahahaha!
I'm Tenkai, leader of the Black Web! Now every living being in Teito has witnessed my awesome power!
I'll use these powers to clean Teito of all filthy Western blood...
In no time, the glorious Tokugawa shogunate will be restored!
Miserable citizens of Teito! You have only one hour left to live!
That means I'll grant the government time until 4 in the night to disband and bow down to me!
As a sign of your submission, you'll hand over 10 billion from the Teito Bank and Lt. Gen. Yoneda!
If you don't meet my demands, Teito's demise will be unavoidable! Waaahahahahaha!
These demands are crazy... This is an outrage! We'll ignore him!
We can't risk the lives of all the people in Teito! What's your decision, Prime Minister?
One hour left... We can't give up hope.
Count Hanakoji... Can't Lt. Gen. Yoneda's outfit help us? The Imperial Floral Assault Troop?
Yes. I just contacted him.
I think we should stop them... No, we MUST stop them!
We can't allow this country to regress to a shogunate!
He wants my life? Fine then! Tenkai! You can have it, but I'll take yours in return!
Minister!
Out of my way! After he's gone to so much trouble, I don't want to disappoint him!
Lieutenant General! There's still one hour left! Please let us do our job!
Minister!
All right, fine! I expect you to do your worst!
They've really grown dependable... And that includes him.
Yeah.
This is...
Ha!... Aa....
If you want to protect someone you love... you have to stand up and face it!
With love in our hearts, we can overcome any difficulty.
Truly loving someone... That means putting your life on the line!
The enemy is above the gate in which the demon is sealed.

That's why these girls were assigned to the revue...
Do you understand Ogami?

That means... it's back to the ticket punching for you, uncle Ichi! Tihihi...
We have to repair the damaged Kobu and prepare them for the next battle!
This is no time to back down!

Ha ha ha!
That's not all. You have a power all your own.
Ogami, do you understand why you were assigned leadership of this corps?
Is that all?
You are a catalyst.
Indeed. Their spiritual power far surpasses that of normal humans.
However, that means nothing if they have no way to channel this vast potential into something productive.
Their powers can even rebound on the users on occasion. We needed someone to teach them all to focus, to work together in pursuit of a common goal.
Under your leadership, the members of the revue have been able to fully exercise their talents for the first time in their lives.
Heh. Maybe I'm exaggerating. Don't want you getting a swelled head, now do we? Ha ha ha.
Hey there Ensign, Commander! What are you two whispering about over here? Secret guy talk?
Now the enemy are out of the picture, we can concentrate on our performances again!
Hihihi...
Oh my, of course!
Whoa! What gives? Why'd you start screaming all of a sudden?
Sorry, I just realized - haven't we forgotten something?
Oh...! You mean...that?
Now you mention it, we haven't done that yet.
No time like the present. Let's do this!
All right, everyone line up. Here we go...
Strike our victory pose, and...!
Yay!
C-Commander?!
Aw, I wanted to say it!
I just thought I'd give it a try for a change.
What are we gonna do with you...
Now now girls, it's not that big a deal, is it? Come on, laugh with me! Ha ha!
Ha ha ha!

Guess whooo~?
Guess whooo~?
Welcome to our shop. Good morning! What can I do for you?
Ah, Ogami, welcome! What can I do for you?
