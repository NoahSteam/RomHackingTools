﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿It's a photo of Sakura. She's looking right at me. I wonder what she's thinking…
It's a photo of Sumire. This is a side of her you don't see too often.
It's a photo of Maria. She's lost in thought and looks kind of sad…
A photo of Kanna. Her signature strength comes through clearly.
A photo of Iris. She's surrounded by flowers and flashing a radiant smile.
A photo of Kohran. She's looking pretty in profile with her face dyed red by the evening sun.
A letter given to me by a customer. I was asked to give it to Sumire. I have a bad feeling about this…
Maria's pistol. This may help me escape from here…
A hair ornament. It's decorated with flowers and looks very elegant.
A pretty pendant. The delicate workmanship is gorgeous.
A hairpin for use in a traditional bun hairstyle. It would complement a formal outfit well.
This key will let me enter rooms I couldn't before.
I found this in a bedroom on the second floor. I can use it to access the back room.
A set of cups Iris asked me to get for her. They have a very stylish design.
This is the matchbox Iris asked for. Its logo is quite colorful.
Some knives Iris asked me to get for her. Just a normal utensil you'd use during a meal.
A prop sword and shield used onstage. They're well-made and look just like the real thing.
A prop crown used onstage. It's well constructed and incredibly detailed.
A wig and costume used onstage. I wonder what kind of act could use a flashy outfit like this?
A photo of Sakura in her swimsuit. Wow, this is really something. I'm gonna treasure this.
A photo of Sumire in her stage costume. Her distinctive makeup really makes an impact.
It's a photo of Maria on stage in the military uniform from "For Love"… She's a beautiful woman disguised as a man.
A photo of Kanna in her training gear. Catching her in a private moment like this feels surprisingly intimate.
A photo of Iris in her swimsuit. She's holding a rubber ring and looks ready to have some fun. How cute.
A photo of Kohran. I don't get to see her with her braids undone very often. It's a nice look.
A photo of Ayame in a traditional outfit. I hope she'll always be as happy and content as she is here.
Ayame's gun. Why…? Why did it have to turn out like this…?
Jean-Paul the teddy bear. Iris's best friend. She always carries him with her and takes good care of him.
…! 
…What is it, Maria? 
What's that voice!? 
Wait, you’re…! 
Damned Hive of Darkness! So we didn't get all of them…? 
What…?! 
What’d you say?! 
What are you planning? 
Ayame! 
Let's go, everyone! We'll show them what our Koubu can do! 
…! 
…OK. It’s been about an hour now. 
Wow… Beautiful! 
Yes, of course. <br> No, I was talking about you. 
Yes, of course. That's perfect for New Year's Day. 
OK, should we get going? Let's take the steam train to Meiji Shrine. 
No, I was talking about you. 
No, I really mean it… 
OK, should we get going? Let's take the steam train to Meiji Shrine. 
…? 
S-Sorry. I was admiring your long-sleeved kimono… 
OK, should we get going? Let's take the steam train to Meiji Shrine. 
Hahaha… 
Oh… The steam train is here right on time. 
Come, Maria. Watch your step when you get in. 
Thank you, Captain. 
OK, Kohran. Slow and steady wins the race. 
Just leave it to me! I know the streets of this city like the back of my hand. We'll be at Meiji Shrine in no time! 
All right then… let's go to Meiji Shrine for our visit. 
You want to walk to the station, Iris? 
Yup! Let's go, Mon Frère! 
OK… How should we get to Meiji Shrine…? 
Taking the steam train would be the fastest… 
Are you serious, Boss?! We'll run there, of course! 
What?! You want to run all the way to Meiji Shrine? 
Sure! The air is wonderful on New Year's Day. It'll be a fun jog. 
Let's go! Or do you want to be left behind? 
Oh boy… this New Year is off to a good start… 
Oh, really? 
No, no… I just wouldn't have expected that. 
What?! No, that's not… 
I just figured you'd get lots of invitations from young counts and princes. 
…? 
Oh really?… Those circles are like a whole other world to me. 
Y-You think so? 
Dancing? I wouldn't remember a single step… 
Hahaha… I'd only step on your feet and embarrass myself. 
(There are secret techniques in ballroom dancing…?!) 
You've got a deal, Sumire! 
Yeah… Just a short time ago, it seemed like the fighting would never stop. 
Whatever happened, it's over now. The world is finally at peace. 
(Back then…?) 
Er, then… why don't you tell me how you celebrate the New Year in Russia? 
I'm sure you don't visit any shrines. So… what do you do on New Year's Eve? 
…A prayer? 
That's a custom I can really picture in cold, cold Russia. 
You know what, Maria… you really changed a lot. You never used to talk like this. 
When we first met, you would get mad at me all the time. 
No, no. You were right. I was so green back then. 
I barely knew what I was doing… 
Nah… But anyway, this is New Year's Day, remember? Let's have some fun! 
Whoa, Kohran! Aren't we going a little too fast? 
But… I still remember what happened when we first met, and… 
Hey, hey! 
And… that's a GOOD thing? 
Waaahh! Lemme off this thing!! 
…? 
Hahaha… That's certainly an honor. 
…Who are you talking about? 
Hey… go easy on me! 
I'm…not sure? 
Is this better? 
OK… 
Of course not! I would never…! 
Hey, we aren't in any kind of hurry, are we? 
Like this? What do you mean? 
What!? 
Yes. 
You mean your parents back in France? 
Oh, really? What did you write about? 
…WHAT!? 
Well I suppose so, but… No… that's not the issue here! 
…Yeah, yeah. OK. 
Huff… Huff… What…are you doing…this early… 
Running…from Ginza…to the Meiji Shrine… Anyone would be…exhausted! 
R-Really? 
So that's why you turned out to be so strong. 
(I don't think there are many men who're stronger than you…) 
…? 
Hahaha… No wonder this is a leisurely stroll for you. 
Heeey, Kanna! Wait up! You're too fast for me! 
Oh boy… if she's like that at Meiji Shrine, she'll probably make me swim to Okinawa… 
Yes. This is the peace you all fought so hard for. 
Yeah. 
I don't want to lose you in the crowd, so let's hold hands. 
Isn't that why you came here? 
You're complaining, but aren't you having fun too? 
Yeah, yeah… 
Well, it's New Year's Day after all… 
…? 
You'll get used to it. Just give it time. 
And… in an atmosphere like this, everyone's enjoying themselves. 
Yeah… it’s always better when things are spirited. 
Whoa… You can't do that in a shrine, or we'll get kicked out! 
Come on, let's just pay our respects at the shrine. 
Wait, Iris! If you run around like that, you'll hurt yourself. 
Hey! You're bumping into people! Watch where you're going! 
Waaaait! If you run off alone, you'll get lost. 
This just makes you realize how peaceful this city has become. And it's all thanks to you guys. 
Thank you… Kanna… but… 
In order to keep this peace, we'll have to work even harder. 
Yeah… sorry. 
… 
(Let's see… what should I wish for?) 
That this peace is eternal. <br> That Sakura likes me. 
(Please let this peace go on forever.) 
(Please let Sakura like me.) 
… 
… 
So, Sakura… What did you wish for? 
… 
(Let's see… what should I wish for?) 
That this peace is eternal. <br> That Sumire likes me. 
(Please let this peace go on forever.) 
(Please let Sumire like me.) 
…
…
So, Sumire… What did you wish for? 
… 
(Let's see… what should I wish for?) 
That this peace is eternal. <br> That Maria likes me. 
(Please let this peace go on forever.) 
(Please let Maria like me.) 
…
… 
OK, should we go? 
What did you wish for, Maria? 
… 
(Let's see… what should I wish for?) 
That this peace is eternal. <br> That Kohran likes me. 
(Please let this peace go on forever.) 
(Please let Kohran like me.) 
… 
… 
So, Kohran… What did you wish for? 
… 
(Let's see… what should I wish for?) 
That this peace is eternal. <br> That Iris likes me. 
(Please let this peace go on forever.) 
(Please let Iris like me.) 
… 
… 
By the way… what was your wish? 
… 
(Let's see… what should I wish for?) 
That this peace is eternal.. <br> That Kanna likes me. 
(Please let this peace go on forever.) 
(Please let Kanna like me.) 
… 
… 
So, Kanna… What did you wish for? 
There are lots of stalls, just like on festival days. 
Ook ook ook! 
Ogami… looks like you've taken a fancy to that monkey. 
Whoa, that monkey's so cute! 
Not as cute as you. <br> Yeah, he's really cute. 
Not as cute as you, Sakura. 
Am I supposed to feel good about that comparison? 
Er… I guess that was a stupid thing to say. 
Yeah, he's really cute. And clever, too! 
That's true… 
If it wasn't for this peace, we wouldn't be able to watch something like this. 
Yes, for sure. 
Don't… Don't you like monkeys? 
No, I was just… Isn't it amazing what the little fellow can do? 
Are you STILL not fed up with that monkey? Let's move on already. 
A… trained monkey? Why would you train a monkey? 
(…?) 
Haven't you seen one before? <br> Isn't it cute? 
Haven't you seen a monkey before, Sumire? 
Apart from biology books, no. 
(I guess with her upbringing, I shouldn't be surprised…) 
Well, I suppose seeing one up close is indeed educational. 
Its behind is really very red. What a stylish little creature. 
Isn't it cute? And clever, too! 
But, alas… I've never grown accustomed to wild animals… 
I see… 
Could we go somewhere else, Ensign? I don't want to catch its smell. 
OK. Should we move on then? 
You really like that monkey, huh? 
Oh, how lovely! So… does it do anything? 
(I see. Maria has never seen a trained monkey before.) 
Explain about trained monkeys. <br> Tell her a fib. 
A trainer taught him all sorts of tricks, like making back-flips and climbing ladders. 
…Oh, really? That sounds amazing. 
They always have them at festivals like this, just like cork shooting ranges and stuff. 
I've learned something new today. 
Should we take a look at the other stalls too? 
…Yes, let's go. 
It's a super smart monkey who has trained a human to do little tricks for him. 
Really!? That sounds unbelievable. 
You really didn't know that? The monkey beats his drum to command his human. 
I have to see that for myself! Let's stay here and watch. 
…What? Uh, that's… 
Hey, Maria! See that over there!? Let's check it out! 
Hehehe… OK, let's go. 
Erm… 
Don't you want to go somewhere else, Ogami? 
Y-Yeah, I guess so. 
But we already saw the monkey! Let's go somewhere else. 
Hmmm, a trained monkey? It's a little different from the ones I used to watch. 
In China, you mean? <br> Looks just like you, Kohran! 
Trained monkeys in China, you mean? I wonder what they can do… 
You don't know them, Chief? They can throw knives, or… 
K-Knives!? 
Or ride on unicycles, walk on tightropes… 
Are you serious!? 
The monkey looks just like you, Kohran! 
Beg your pardon? In what way do I resemble that monkey!? 
No, no, I just meant… You're just as cute as him! 
Nice save, Chief. 
But don't take me for some stupid little thing, and watch what you say! 
Sorry about that… let's move on, Kohran. 
What is it, Chief? You look like you're completely mesmerized! 
Are you lost in deep thought after seeing the monkey’s performance? 
Ah, no, I… 
Anyway, let's get going. I wanna see lots of stuff while we're here! 
Looking at that monkey again, Mon Frère? 
Whoa, what a cute monkey! 
Yeah, kind of. 
Are they in France, too? <br> Looks just like you, Iris! 
By the way… are there monkeys in France, too? 
Yep! And they all have blonde hair like me! 
Wha…!? 
Hehehe… Gotcha! 
Wait a second… so you were just kidding? 
Now I want to get a monkey stuffed animal.
It looks just like you, Iris! 
What!? What do you mean, Mon Frère? 
Oh, er… I just meant that the monkey is almost as cute as you, Iris. 
You're not just making that up on the spot as an excuse, are you? 
Of… Of course not! Anyway, why don’t we go somewhere else, OK? 
What's up, Mon Frère? 
Ah… Sorry. I was just transfixed by that monkey… 
I've seen everything around here, so let's go somewhere else, please! 
OK, let's go! 
Don't you think there's still other stuff to see? 
Wow, he's really agile! 
Who's more agile, him or you? <br> Know monkey-style kung fu? 
I wonder… who do you think is more agile, him or you? 
Wait, don't talk about me like I'm an ape! But yeah, I guess he's faster than me. 
I see… 
But it's not all about speed. In a fight, you also need to punch hard. I'd beat him hands down. 
Oh, er… Would you now? 
(I really shouldn't encourage her to punch animals…) 
Do you know monkey-style kung fu? 
What's that supposed to be? 
Well, kung fu where you move like a monkey. Seeing this little guy, it just came to my mind. 
Interesting… you sure know a lot of stuff, Boss. 
Hahaha… 
Ahaha… If you look at them like this, monkeys are pretty cute. 
Absolutely. And clever, too! 
It's not bad to watch a show like this once in a while. 
We already did the cork-shooting. Let's try something else. 
Oh, looks like you can play Target the Demon here! 
That looks fun. Do you want to try it, Captain? 
Wait, grown-ups can't play! It would be too easy for you! 
If you want to play something, why not try the shooting stall in the back? 
OK, bring it on! <br> …I'd rather not. 
OK, bring it on! It's only New Year's Day once a year, so let's have some fun! 
My pleasure! I'll show you to the cork-shooting stall. 
Nah, I don't feel like it. 
No? Too bad… 
Should we go somewhere else? We came all the way here, so let's look at all the different stalls. 
You're right. OK, let's move on. 
Nah, I don't feel like it. 
No? How boring… 
Isn't that a game for children? 
You never stop learning. Even a children's game can teach you valuable life lessons. 
Should we go somewhere else? We came all the way here, so let's look at all the different stalls. 
In that case, I'm with you. Let us go. 
Nah, I don't feel like it. 
You don't want to? That's a pity. 
You should save your shooting skills for when we're in battle. 
Hehe… That's true. 
Nah, I don't feel like it. 
What, you don't wanna do it? Boring… 
Should we go somewhere else? We came all the way here, so let's look at all the different stalls. 
I guess you're right. Let's go then! 
Nah, I don't feel like it. 
Whaaat? You don't wanna!? 
The other stalls look interesting too. Since we're here, let's walk around a bit and check them out. 
OK then. I don't mind either way. 
Nah, I don't feel like it. 
You don't feel like trying it? Man, what a buzzkill. 
Come, Kanna. You should always leave a little room for more. 
That only applies to food! But whatever you say… 
Good job! Here's your prize. Why don't you give it to your lovely lady? 
This is for you, Sakura! 
Whoa, a pendant? Thank you so much! 
I'm so happy! I'll treasure this! 
This is for you, Sakura! 
Whoa, that takes me back… A Knitting Nancy! 
Thank you, Ogami! 
This is for you, Sakura! 
Wow, thank you! What a cute cactus! 
But you know, you already gave me a cactus before… 
Whoops, you're right. Sorry, I didn't mean to give you the same thing twice… 
Oh, don't worry. I'm sure they'll look lovely next to each other! 
A cactus. It's so nostalgic… My father loved them… 
Ah, right… 
Ogami, in the language of flowers, the cactus means "passion". 
Even without water, they grow strong. 
I see… 
Oh, don't worry. I'm sure they'll look lovely next to each other! 
Good job! Here's your prize. Why don't you give it to your lovely lady? 
This is for you, Sumire! 
Oh my, how sweet… 
I'll hold this dear, Ensign. 
Haha… Don't make me blush. 
This is for you, Sumire! 
My, what a nice doll! But what's this pole for? 
I think it's called a Knitting Nancy? 
How do you use it? I have to ask Sakura when we're back. 
I've received many presents in my life… 
But a toy? That's a first. 
I will treasure it. Thank you, Ensign. 
Haha… Don't make me blush. 
This is for you, Sumire! 
Oh, a cactus? Thank you, I'll take good care of it. 
Good job! Here's your prize. Why don't you give it to your lovely lady? 
This is for you, Maria! 
A pendant? Thank you! 
This is for you, Maria! 
A toy? Hehehe… Thank you. 
This is for you, Maria! 
A cactus? I'll take good care of it. 
Good job! Here's your prize. Why don't you give it to your lovely lady? 
This is for you, Kohran! 
Whoa, that pendant is a looker! Thanks so much, Chief! 
This is for you, Kohran! 
A toy set? Thanks, Chief. 
This is for you, Kohran! 
Oh, a cactus! Thanks, Chief. I'll take good care of it. 
Good job! Here's your prize. Why don't you give it to your lovely lady? 
Here, Iris… this is for you! 
Mon Frère… you gave me a pendant before, don't you remember? 
Oh, sorry! I didn't mean to give you the same thing again… 
OK! Another addition to my treasure pile! 
Whoa, what a beautiful pendant! Thank you, Mon Frère! 
Hehehe… This is my precious treasure now! 
Here, Iris… this is for you! 
Wow, how cute! A doll, and a Knitting Nancy too! 
Thanks, Mon Frère! I'm so happy! 
Here, Iris… this is for you! 
What's that? Some sort of messed-up flower? 
It's called a cactus. It's not a flower. 
Not a flower? Then these are leaves? 
That's… Ah, it doesn't matter. Let's go, Iris! 
Good job! Here's your prize. Why don't you give it to your lovely lady? 
This is for you, Kanna! 
Thank you, Boss! I've never gotten anything like this! 
I'm not one to care for plants, but I'll give it my best! 
This is for you, Kanna! 
That's one cute doll! When I was little, I kind of… I always wanted a doll… 
Thanks, Boss. I'll always keep it close. 
This is for you, Kanna! 
Oh, a cactus? Thanks. I'll take good care of it. 
You look like you're really into it. 
Whoa, Ogami… this takes me back! 
Used to play with them a lot. <br> Never really tried it before. 
I used to play with these things a lot. 
You too? When we had one of our country festivals, there were always lots of stalls. 
I would always get really into it. 
Hehe… I was the same way. 
Sorry, I've never really tried it before. 
Oh, really? Don't worry, I'll show you. 
Thanks… 
Hmmm… 
Don't you like this? 
No, that's not it… Sorry. 
No need to apologize. Let's just go somewhere else. 
Can’t put it out of your mind, Ensign? 
Ensign, in what manner would you play with this? 
Have you never seen one? <br> You cut out shapes. 
Have you never seen something like this before, Sumire? 
No, I've never come to a festival before. 
So… the point is cutting out certain shapes. 
Of course I know that! Who do you take me for? 
Really…? Ah, no, no! Not like that… 
Don't worry, I can do it myself! No problem at all… 
Oooh! Why did it break!? 
Erm… 
So you’re not well-versed in this either, Ensign? 
Sorry. 
I've had enough of this childish game. Let's move on. 
You seem to be really enjoying this. 
Say, what do you do with this? 
Oh, you don't know what this is, Maria? 
Let me show you… 
It's something to eat. <br> You cut out shapes. <br> First to destroy it wins. 
It's something to eat. 
…So, it's like rusk bread? 
Er, not really… 
…Hm, it doesn't taste of anything. 
Oh… you really ate it? 
It's sort of a game, see? You cut out shapes. 
Oh, really? It doesn't look that difficult. 
Oh dear… I've missed. 
Yes, it's a pity. 
It looked so easy when the kids were doing it… Let's give it another go. 
Hahaha, you can't stand losing, huh? 
It's a game. Whoever destroys it first is the winner. 
Oh, really? OK then… 
Whoa! M-Maria! 
Like this? 
Yeah… 
… 
Let's go, Maria. 
Erm… 
Hehe… You don't know, Ogami? It's fine, let's go somewhere else. 
Sorry. 
I've had enough of this, Chief. Let's make ourselves scarce. 
Hm, this is the first time I've seen something like this. 
What did you play as a kid? <br> This takes me back… 
By the way, Kohran… What games did you play as a kid? 
Like I told you before, I've only played Hanafuda. 
Interesting… 
Stalls in Japan really have the weirdest stuff. 
This takes me back… I used to do it all the time as a kid. 
Wow. I always thought you'd been born a full-grown adult, Chief. 
H-How do you mean? 
I… I was only kidding! No hard feelings, eh? 
…Really? 
Well, erm… 
This your first time too, Chief? 
No, not at all! See… 
Come on, Chief. It's fine to admit you don't know anything about it. 
Sorry. 
You like this stall THAT much, Mon Frère? 
What's this, Frère? 
It's like a relief, I guess. <br> It's cake. 
It's something like a relief, I guess. Only made of cake. 
Really!? Lemme see, lemme see! 
Oh… You really ate it? 
It doesn't taste like anything. I don't like it… 
Missy, it doesn’t work if you eat it. 
Whaaaat? Really? 
It's a type of cake but… 
Really!? Lemme see, lemme see! 
Oh… You really ate it? 
Missy, it doesn’t work if you eat it. 
Wow, really? 
Why didn't you tell me right away? 
…Hm. What should I say? 
What is this, Mon Frère? 
What is it? What is it? What is it? Tell me, Mon Frère! 
Hm… I'll explain it to you some other time. 
Hm…? Now I’m even more curious. 
Haven't you seen enough of this? You really like it, huh? 
I'm not good with fiddly stuff like that… 
This takes me back… <br> Should we get the biggest one? 
This takes me back… I used to play this game all the time as a kid. 
I don't like eensy-weensy stuff. 
Really? But that's the fun thing about it… 
What do you think, Kanna? Should we get the biggest one? 
Thanks, but… that really doesn't change anything. 
No? Well, if you don't feel like it… 
…Phew, this is really hard. 
…Boss. 
Wait a second! This head here… 
Listen… I said I don't like this. Don't you think it's a bit selfish to do it on your own? 
Oh, sorry. I just… 
Come on! Let's go someplace else! 
…Hm? 
H-Hey! 
What was that!? 
…! 
What… What are you all…? 
Well… You kind of dragged me along. 
Sumire… 
Er… Hi, Sakura… What a coincidence! 
…What? With everyone? 
Even you, Maria… 
(Oh, shoot… There goes my quality time with Sumire…) 
No, I… I just showed you around… 
Hm…? No, nothing particular… 
(What should I do? If we go now, we'll be back pretty late…) 
(We can't leave the theater unattended for so long…) 
OK, let's go! <br> We can't leave it unattended… 
…OK, let's go! It's New Year's Day, so let's have some fun! 
We shouldn't leave the theater unattended… New Year's Day or not, we never know when we have to deploy. 
(Hm… What should we do…?) 
Sa… Sakura! 
Er… Hi, Sakura… What a coincidence! 
…What? With everyone? 
I-Iris!? 
(Oh, shoot… There goes my quality time with Maria…) 
OK. It's nice and quiet here, so let's rest for a while. 
Huh…? What are you saying? You didn't have to come if you didn't want to. 
I wanted to come here with you… That's why I invited you. 
Kohran… 
Er… Hi, Sakura… What a coincidence! 
…What? With everyone?  
Even you, Maria… 
(Oh, shoot… There goes my quality time with Kohran…) 
Wha… Why are you asking me that all of a sudden? 
Of course… I like you. <br> Hahaha! Sure, I like you! 
Of course… I like you. 
Hahaha! Sure, I like you! 
L-Love!? 
(Oh dear… I should be careful what I say…) 
S-Sakura! What a coincidence, running into you here, of all places… 
…What? With everyone? 
Even you, Maria… 
(Oh man… I was looking forward to spending the day with Iris…) 
Ahaha… Yes, you're right. <br> It's fun once in a while. 
Ahaha… Yes, you're right. 
No really, it's been fun. 
But running here all the way… I mean, what a date! 
… 
It's fun once in a while. 
Oh… No, I didn't mean it that way! Kanna, please wait! 
… 
S-Sakura! What a coincidence, running into you here, of all places… 
…What? With everyone? 
Even you, Maria… 
(Oh, shoot… There goes my quality time with Kanna…)

Oho… Normally my servants would drive me places. 
That's beneath me. 
Let's go then.

Sorry you had to wait! 
You mean this dress? 
I wanted to dress in a real Japanese kimono. New Year's Day only comes once a year, after all! 
And also… it's my first date with you, Ogami. 
Even if you're only flattering me, that makes me happy. 
Thank you, really. 
Ah! The train's here! Let's get on! 
What a crowd! So this is what New Year's Day is like in Tokyo! 
I'm so glad Tokyo is finally at peace… 
OK… let's get going! 
What a crowd… 
Of course…

So many people in one place… These commoners all behave like faceless drones. 
If you want to win the hearts of commoners, you must do as they do. 
I hope you appreciate my efforts. 
Come on, Ensign! Let's go. 
Quickly! 
Oh, not bad! Very festive. 
Oh, stop it… you really went all out there. 
You're a great guy. 
Hey… do you have to talk shop when it's just the two of us? 
But… that's just what I like about you. 
Come on, let's go. 
So… this is what you do on New Year's Day? Sure is somber. 
Hmmm, there’s no liveliness at all. It’s awfully lonesome… 
Oh, let's light some firecrackers! Then we'll get in the mood! 
Really? How boring… 
Right. Wanna go now? 
Whoaaa… So many people! Don't you think, Mon Frère? 
Hey, hey, hey… What's that real big house over there? 
Come on, Mon Frère! 
All right, let’s go! 
I'm not telling. 
Let's go then. 
Ohohoho… That's a secret. 
Should we get going? 
Nah, it's nothing… 
Wanna get going? 
Oh, it's nothing. 
Let's go somewhere else, Mon Frère! 
I’m not telling! 
Step right up, step right up! We've got a monkey straight from China! 
How about it? Wanna give it a go, sir? 
Let's try it, Ogami! 
Hmph… A childish diversion. 
Boss! Let's try that! 
Unused
Hey, Mon Frère. I wanna try!

Not bad at all! 
I'm impressed, Chief! 
You're so awesome, Mon Frère!

Please come here, Ogami. 
Come here for a moment. 
Really, Ensign… Why did you have to take me to such an out of the way place? 
Oh, no need to blush. There's no one around who could see us. 
Oh, Captain! And Sumire, too… 
Sakura… 
Unused
Heya, Sakura! Fancy running into you here! 
Wh… Why are you all here? 
Unused
That's right! Isn't it nice for all of the Flower Division to celebrate the New Year together? 
Exactly. We wanted to have fun together. 
That was fun! Something like this isn't bad once in a while. A bit like a date. 
What? What is it? What's with that artificial laugh? 
So being with me really isn't enough…? 
Oh, Captain! And Kanna, too. 
S-Sakura!? 
Unused
Unused
Wh-Wh-Why is everyone here all of a sudden!? 
Come on, Chief… Where else would we go on New Year's Day but the shrine? 
That's right! Isn't it nice for all of the Flower Division to celebrate the New Year together? 
I agreed… the more the merrier. 
Phew… There's a bunch of people everywhere. Really makes me tired. 
Thanks. Tell me one thing, Chief… 
Are you happy you visited the shrine with me? 
Really? Makes me happy to hear you say so! 
Oh, Captain! And Kohran, too. 
S-Sakura!? 
Unused
Oooh, there's Sakura! Yoohoo! 
Why's everyone here all of a sudden!? 
Ohohoho… Where else would we go on New Year's Day but the shrine? 
Didn't we agree to celebrate the New Year together? 
Not really… 
That's right! Isn't it nice for all of the Flower Division to celebrate the New Year together? 
That's it! 
Tell me, Mon Frère… What do you think of me? 
Do you… like me? 
Hehehe… I love you too, Mon Frère! 
Aww, come on! If you wanna confess your love to me, you have to be more serious! 
Oh, Captain! And Iris, too. 
Ah… Sakura! 
So you really wanted to visit the shrine with everyone, Ogami? 
Sakura! What are the odds? 
Why's everyone here? 
Come on, Chief… Where else would we go on New Year's Day but the shrine? 
Yeah, let's have a roaring good time together! 
That's right! Isn't it nice for all of the Flower Division to celebrate the New Year together? 
Oh, look… a manifestation of the North Star Buddha! 
I have to pay my respects, as a user of the Hokushin Itto style. 
Daaaaaaaa! 
Whoa… 
Unused
We just followed you! 
We can't let you have all the fun! 
Ohohohoho… 
Gave you a start, eh? Yup, we just thought we’d surprise ya! 
Let's all visit the shrine together! 
Unused
Right on! That's what I like about you, Sakura! 
It feels like we're being watched… 
Hmhmhmhm…! 
That voice… 
Over there! 
So we meet again, my friends of the Imperial Assault Troupe! 
You may call me… Cerulean Satan!! 
The Hive of Darkness…? Don't make me laugh. 
Tenkai is gone for good. After all, he was nothing more than the shogunate's lap dog. 
But I, Cerulean Satan, am of a different breed! I will never give up! 
Your precious peace won't continue forever. Pray all you want! 
A ridiculous man such as yourself, one that is so easily bewitched by the charms of women… 
You will never put a stop to me… 
I'll level this city for good. Every citizen will cower before me! 
My plans? Heheheheh… Hahahaha…!
I just can't stand the sight of humans living in peace and happiness! 
In fact, nothing gives me greater pleasure than seeing the look of pain and fear in their eyes! 
You won't indulge in your sick pleasures on our watch! 
I'll destroy everyone and everything you love! 
What!? 
Heheheh… Come to me, all ye children of the gutter, all ye oppressed and evil! 
I am the great liberator of demons! Come forth, Kouma! 
That's…!? 
Gigiyah… gigigigyahhhh! 
What in blazes are these crazy looking monsters? 
Look out, everyone! 
Unused
Ah! The Soaring Whale! 
Seems like we made it just in time! 
The Soaring Whale! We're saved! 
OK! Let's beat these bad guys to a pulp! 
Let's go!

Sorry. I tried to stop them… 
I never expected a day like this to come… 
To finally be able to enjoy these carefree days… 
You're right… I could never go back to what I was like back then. 
Oh, what am I saying? I shouldn't dwell on those old stories. 
New Year's Day in Russia? 
It's not that different from Japan. 
We get together with friends and party all night. 
And then, when the day is dawning across the snowy fields, we turn towards it and say a prayer. 
We pray to have another good year. 
Maybe not, but… am I really that different now? 
Heheh… I'm sorry. Back then, I was just… 
But even so… that greenhorn Ensign Ogami risked his life to save me. 
Don't play it down, Captain. I'm really grateful. 
Heheh, I guess you're right. 
Unused
Visiting the shrine at the side of a gentleman… This is a first for me. 
Is it that strange? 
What kind of woman do you think I am, Ogami?! 
Oh no, those gentlemen never talk to me. 
They don't talk to ME. They talk to the daughter of the Kanzaki conglomerate. 
I'm sure you would look splendid in formal wear though. 
You're an ensign, after all. You must at least have learned ballroom dancing, right? 
Just say the word, and it would be my pleasure to help you remember… 
Hohoho, impossible! I could teach you all the secret techniques of ballroom dancing. 
We should definitely give it a go sometime. As I said… whenever you want! 
You're late, Ensign! Didn't you practice running in the Navy? 
Ahaha… This feels so good, I got a bit carried away. 
Come on! This little stroll is enough to make you huff and puff like you're about to die? 
Pathetic… In Okinawa, the men aren't that weak. 
Yeah, my old man was very strong, too. He'd never gripe and moan. Always training like a fiend. 
Ha! But, as a woman I can't really brag about this. That's why I like strong men. 
And I'm not talking about karate and stuff. 
A guy who doesn't give up, no matter what… that's real strength. 
Heheh… You should do some exercising under Okinawa's scorching sun, too! 
I just love the place! Every time I go back there, I forget about all my troubles. 
I'd really like to take you there someday. That endless sky, the azure sea… 
Mon Frère! Come on, come ON! 
Can I ask you something? What will people think when they see us like this? 
That we're siblings? A couple? Or a girl who's being kidnapped by a stranger? 
Heehee! Just kidding! 
About that place we're going to… it's called a "shrine", right? 
Heehee, that's great! I’ll have to tell Mama and Papa about my visit in a letter! 
I wrote one just the other day. I told them about you, Mon Frère. 
How you kissed me! 
How you told me you loved me. 
Did I do something wrong? I'm not so much younger than Sakura! 
Soon, you won't see me as a child anymore! 
I'll be older than the other girls in no time! 
Unused
It's all right! Trust me! 
There was just a little problem with the engine back then. 
It's a whole different beast now! 
I improved it a lot, especially the suspension! Thanks to my special fuel, the engine is 2.5 times more powerful! 
If I put wings on it, it'd probably take off! 
This is the first run with human passengers though. 
Don't worry! Just think about how lucky you are, Chief! 
You're the first guy who gets to ride behind me! 
Unlike most other folks, I’m a well-mannered lady! 
All right! Here we fly! 
Wa-Wa-Wait a second, Chief! Where do you think you're holding on to!? 
Stop it, stop it! Move your hands a little lower! 
Eeek! Not THAT low! Higher, higher! 
I gotta ask, Chief… you didn't do that on purpose, did ya? 
Well, all right. 
Wow… so many people… 
Everyone looks like they're having fun. 
Ah, sorry. I'm not used to this sort of atmosphere… 
Yes… 
Heheh… You're right. 
Me? I wished for this peace to go on forever. 
Thank you, Captain. This was a lovely day. 
I felt like I could let my hair down for the first time in a long while. 
Do you have anything planned for later? 
I was wondering… maybe you'd want to take a stroll to Yokohama with me? 
A friend of mine has a cafe at the harbor. It's small, but… 
I've been meaning to go there. But I would have felt foolish going alone. 
Yeah, that's true… 
Thank you! 
Guys…! 
What are you all doing here? 
OK! Let's go there together with the whole Flower Division!
