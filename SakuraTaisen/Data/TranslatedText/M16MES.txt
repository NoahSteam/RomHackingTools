I've got to focus!
Here I go!
Leave it to me!!
Watch this, Ogami.
I'm fine, I can still fight…
Thank you!
Keep it up, Ogami!
I knew I could count on you!
Kyaaa!
Ngh, I'll show you next time!
I'm sorry… Ogami…
It's my turn in the spotlight.
Hahaha!
I'm off!!
Today's performance is all for you!
It'll take more than that to bring me down…
Ensign, so you really do care for me…
Come, Ensign, it's your move!
I'll be watching you!
Uwahhh!!
I suppose I'll let you win for now!
The captain needs me!!
I'll have to take down the enemies myself!
Where's my next target!?
Whoever wants to die first, just step forward…
I'll be relying on your orders, sir!
I'm not finished yet!! Not yet!!
You would go that far… for my sake…
Focus, sir!
We'll make it out of this alive!
Ahhh!!
They're too strong!! I need to withdraw!!
Forgive me, sir. I need to withdraw!
I can fight too!
Here I go!
I'm super strong!
I'll fight hard for Mon Frère!!
Uh, some of these lights are flashing…
You're the best, Mon Frère!
Go get 'em Mon Frère!
I'll be watching!
Kyaaaa!!
Stupid… stars…
Sorry, Mon Frère…
Gonna go all out.
Better not underestimate science~!
Movin' out!!
Check this out!
I'm takin' too much damage here!
Aww, you're the best!
I'm rootin' for ya!
Take 'em down, Chief!
Uwahhh…
Dangit… they got me…
Sorry Chief…
All right! Let's do this!!
Full power! Hiyaaaaa!
Feast your eyes on the killer techniques of the Kirishima!
Let's take 'em down, Boss!!
No problem! It's just a scratch!!
Thanks! I owe you one!
Get in there, Boss!
Let's see what you can do!
Uwahhh…
Damn. Guess I still haven't trained enough…
I've gotta keep fighting… for the Boss.
All right!
We did it!
We did it!
Phew!
Nice one!
Woo! We did it!!
Ready…
Victory pose… Yeah!
Lord Satan just wanted me to keep them busy… But I don't care!
I’ll show him what I’m made of… by wiping out the Flower Division!
The Imperial Assault Troupe has arrived!
Hmph, so you've come… little girls!
All units, listen up! Their goal is to steal a top-secret item of great importance that's hidden in the theater.
Something top-secret?
Whatever do you mean?
I'll tell you once the fight is over! For the time being, don't allow them to get inside the theater.
Sheesh, what's with all the secrecy?…
C'mon! The faster we take these guys down, the faster we'll be able to find out about it, right?
Well, little girls! Come witness the true power of Shika, the Deer! The most powerful Kouma of all!
I am… I am…the strongest Koumaaaaa!!
Whoa?! There's snow as far as the eye can see!
It's cold as heck!
Ensign, look there! The enemy is using the blizzard to conceal their movements!
What?!
Geheheh! Now, I can summon my Kouma to ravage your headquarters!
Damn! They're trying to break into our headquarters! Everyone, protect the theater!
There seem to be strange objects summoning the Kouma throughout the town. Let's destroy them all!
Go, my underlings! Infiltrate the theater!
Three left!
Three more!
Three to go!
There's three more!
Just three more!
Three left now!
Yes! Just three more remaining!
Two left!
Two more!
Two to go!
There's two more!
Just two more!
Two left now!
Yes! Just two more remaining!
One left!
One more!
One to go!
There's one more!
Just one more!
One left now!
Yes! Just one more remaining!
We destroyed all of them! Just Deer left now!
We destroyed all of them! Just Deer remains!
We destroyed all of them! Only Deer remains!
We beat them all up! Only one more!
We showed 'em what for! Now we only gotta take down their boss!
Yeah, we destroyed all of them! Only that guy's left now!
We've defeated them all! If we take down Deer, this will be over!
Gaaaaaah!
You idiot! The Kouma managed to get in!
Oh no!
It's fine! We thought this might happen, so we set up a trap!
Gah?! Waaaaaaah!
Wh-What's that?
A… bucket of water?
Ogami, you simpleton! What kind of a trap is that?!
Sir… Did you really think that would hold back the Kouma?
No… I just…
The inner wall has been breached!
Damn it! OK, then leave the ones inside to us!
We can't use the same trap again! Don't let them get in by any means!
The hell are you doing?! Not even Iris would fall for that!
Sorry. I got inspired by the last show…
Anyway, heads up, guys! We've still got more of 'em incoming!
Gaaaaaah!
You idiot! The Kouma managed to get in!
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
Damn it!
Gaaaaaah!
You idiot! The Kouma managed to get in!
Damn!
It's fine! We thought this might happen, so we set up a trap!
Gah?! Waaaaaaah!
Yeah! That worked!
I see… You set a trap to prevent the enemy from getting in.
But… how did you know the Kouma would attack the Imperial Theater?
Sorry… there's a top-secret object hidden in the theater that the enemy is after.
But because it's top-secret, I couldn't tell any of you about it.
Anyway, heads up, guys! We've still got more of 'em incomin'!
This trap won't hold them forever! Don't let any more come in!
Gaaaaaah!
You idiot! The Kouma managed to get in!
Gah?! Waaaaaaah!
Yeah! That worked!
Heads up, guys! We've still got more of 'em incomin'!
This trap is out of commission now! You can't let in any more enemies!
Gaaaaaah!
You idiot! The Kouma managed to get in!
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
Oh no!
Gaaaaaah!
You idiot! The Kouma managed to get in!
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
Oh no! We should have set a trap…!
That was a formidable foe… but we were victorious in the end.
OK, everyone! Let's do our thing!
Listen! You can't let any enemies enter the theater!
When you go to destroy the devices, leave someone to protect the theater. If they get in, we're done for. 
Deer moves twice. Use everyone to surround him and finish him off.
I think everyone will be fine without my protection.
I will protect you, Sakura!
I'll always be there to protect you, Sumire.
Let me watch your back for you, Maria.
I'll always be there for you, Iris.
Don't worry, Kohran! I'll protect you!
Kanna! I've got your back!
Comparing the Kouma to Iris? That's the apex of absurdity!
What's that supposed to mean? Do you think I'm stupid?! Grrrrrrrrrr!
This is nothing… You're nothiiiiing!
Geheheh, I'm the best! Some ridiculous Assault Troupe can't take me on!
Our strongest foe yet! <br> Is that all?
Damn… This is the strongest foe we've faced yet!
Geheheh, of course I am! And I'll collect all your heads as proof!
Oh no! You should never encourage guys like him!
Is that all? Even those Hive of Darkness guys were more of a challenge.
Are you… making fun of me?! Graaaah! I'll k-k-k-kill yooooouuuu!
Good job, Ogami! He seems to get sloppy when he loses his composure.
What's up? So star-struck you can't say anything? Geheheh!
Oh no! You should never encourage guys like him!
Listen, Ogami… What's that top-secret thing you mentioned? I promise I won't tell anyone!
By the way, Ensign… What's that top-secret affair you mentioned? Can't you tell little old me?
By the way, Captain… That secret you mentioned… what kind of a thing is it?
Listen up, Chief… Couldn't ya let me in on what that top-secret thing is all about? I won't tell!
Hey, Boss… What’s up with that top-secret thing you mention earlier? Can't you tell me?
Mon Frère, what's that secret you were talking about? I'm sooo curious!
Well, it's…<br>No!
Well, it's…
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
I see.
Yeah.
U-huh.
You're sooo mean! You couldn't tell ME!
How nice of you! Yet you couldn't tell ME, apparently.
Are you sure, Captain? It IS top secret, after all…
But ya couldn't tell it to ME! You're the worst, Chief! Go hang yourself!
Not cool, Boss! You couldn't even tell ME, remember?
I hate you soooooo much! Why couldn't you tell ME, huh?
What's that… He's spilling his guts.
What's that… He's spilling his guts.
What's that… He's spilling his guts.
What's that… He's spilling his guts.
What's that… He's spilling his guts.
What's that… He's spilling his guts.
Oh… Oh no! The channel was turned on!
You dumbass! Flapping your yap like that… and you call yourself a soldier?!
Y-Yes, sir! So sorry, sir! It won't happen again!
No! Our communications might leak to the enemy. I'll tell you after we destroy them!
I see… Sorry I asked.
That's true. I apologize.
Absolutely true. I'm sorry for my thoughtlessness.
Yeah, guess you're right. Shouldn't have asked ya.
Oh, right. I didn't think of that.
Bah! You're sooo strict!
…
Sorry, we should prioritize taking down the enemy.
Sorry. Let's talk after we've defeated the enemy.
Sorry. It was careless of me to bring that up during a battle.
I shouldn't have asked right in the middle of fightin'. Sorry, Chief.
OK… I'll ask you again after we've wiped them out.
Don't want to talk to me? You're so mean, Mon Frère!
