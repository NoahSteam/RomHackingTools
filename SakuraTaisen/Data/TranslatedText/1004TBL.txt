…Yes. 
… no… 
…Yes! 
And so, the curtain fell on our battle. 
Since then, there have been no major incidents… 
…and the Imperial Assault Troupe has been on standby. 
On the other hand, the Flower Division has been performing for a full house nearly every day… 
…and the girls are always busy with the theater. 
Lieutenant General Yoneda is the same as ever… 
…and everyone spends their days working diligently. 
Peaceful days have returned to the capital. 
Time seems to slip by so quickly. 
We've suffered a great deal of loss this past year… 
…but we've gained a great deal more. 
And once again, spring has returned to the capital. 
Peace reigns on earth. 
With that in mind, we've decided to allow ourselves a little sabbatical from performances.

Ah… gh… grhhh… aghhh 
Ahhhghh… Mi… chael… 
Come home with me, Satan. Our Father, which dwells in Heaven, awaits you. 
Michael. Are you saying that I am forgiven? 
God's time is eternal, as is His love. 
There is no sin so great it cannot be washed clean. 
Michael. 
You're not alone. Come. 
Nraggggh!! Silence!! 
I apologize for nothing! I regret nothing! Not my rebellion against Father, nor my fall to Hell! 
The 'love' of Heaven is not but a falsehood! I will never understand our Father's tolerance for these humans! 
That is why I kill, that is why I spread misery, that is why I will destroy this living world!! 
You see nothing but the present!! 
But no love will be born from this day! There will no longer be a Heaven above!! 
Humans are more suited for living in fear, trembling in darkness and despair! Haha… HAHAHA!! 
I will withdraw for now. But, as long as humans exist, I shall be reborn time and time again!! 
Satan! Return with me!! 
I don't need Heaven's light!! I have lived by the sword, and now I will die by the sword!! 
Satan… 
Thank you, Imperial Assault Troupe. 
But, sadly this does not mean an end to the fighting. 
Your true fight is just beginning.

Farewell, everyone. 
Hey! That's not a face a man should make. Pull yourself together! 
That is more acceptable. 
Fare thee well, Ogami.
