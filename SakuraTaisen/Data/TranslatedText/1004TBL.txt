﻿It's a photo of Sakura. She's looking right at me. I wonder what she's thinking...
It's a photo of Sumire. This is a side of her you don't see too often.
It's a photo of Maria. ...She's lost in thought and looks kind of sad...
A photo of Kanna. She looks strong and reliable. I can't wait to meet her.
A photo of Iris. She's surrounded by flowers and flashing a radiant smile.
A photo of Kohran. She's looking pretty in profile with her face dyed red by the evening sun.
A letter given to me by a customer. I was asked to give it to Sumire. I have a bad feeling about this...
Maria's pistol. This may help me escape from here...
A hair ornament. It's decorated with flowers and looks very elegant.
A pretty pendant. The delicate workmanship is gorgeous.
A hairpin for use in a traditional bun hairstyle. It would complement a formal outfit well.
This key will let me enter rooms I couldn't before.
I found this in a bedroom on the second floor. I can use it to access the back room.
A teacup Iris asked me to get for her. It has a very stylish design.
This is the matchbox Iris asked for. Its logo is quite colorful.
A knife Iris asked me to get for her. Just a normal utensil you'd use during a meal.
A prop sword and shield used onstage. They're well-made and look just like the real thing.
A prop crown used onstage. It's well constructed and incredibly detailed.
A wig and costume used onstage. I wonder what kind of act could use a flashy outfit like this?
A photo of Sakura in her swimsuit. Wow, this is really something. I'm gonna treasure this.
A photo of Sumire in her stage costume. Her distinctive makeup really makes an impact.
It's a photo of Maria on stage in the military uniform from "For Love"... She's a beautiful woman disguised as a man.
A photo of Kanna in her training gear. Catching her in a private moment like this feels surprisingly intimate.
A photo of Iris in her swimsuit. She's holding a rubber ring and looks ready to have some fun. How cute.
A photo of Kohran. I don't get to see her with her braids undone very often. It's a nice look.
A photo of Ayame in a traditional outfit. I hope she'll always be as happy and content as she is here.
Ayame's gun. Why...? Why did it have to turn out like this...?
Jean-Paul the teddy bear. Iris's best friend. She always carries him with her and takes good care of him.
…Yes. 
… no… 
…Yes! 
And so, the curtain fell on our battle. 
Since then, there have been no major incidents… 
…and the Imperial Assault Troupe has been on standby. 
On the other hand, the Flower Division has been performing for a full house nearly every day… 
…and the girls are always busy with the theater. 
Lieutenant General Yoneda is the same as ever… 
…and everyone spends their days working diligently. 
Peaceful days have returned to the capital. 
Time seems to slip by so quickly. 
We've suffered a great deal of loss this past year… 
…but we've gained a great deal more. 
And once again, spring has returned to the capital. 
Peace reigns on earth. 
With that in mind, we've decided to allow ourselves a little sabbatical from performances.

Ah… gh… grhhh… aghhh 
Ahhhghh… Mi… chael… 
Come home with me, Satan. Our Father, which dwells in Heaven, awaits you. 
Michael. Are you saying that I am forgiven? 
God's time is eternal, as is His love. 
There is no sin so great it cannot be washed clean. 
Michael. 
You're not alone. Come. 
Nraggggh!! Silence!! 
I apologize for nothing! I regret nothing! Not my rebellion against Father, nor my fall to Hell! 
The 'love' of Heaven is not but a falsehood! I will never understand our Father's tolerance for these humans! 
That is why I kill, that is why I spread misery, that is why I will destroy this living world!! 
You see nothing but the present!! 
But no love will be born from this day! There will no longer be a Heaven above!! 
Humans are more suited for living in fear, trembling in darkness and despair! Haha… HAHAHA!! 
I will withdraw for now. But, as long as humans exist, I shall be reborn time and time again!! 
Satan! Return with me!! 
I don't need Heaven's light!! I have lived by the sword, and now I will die by the sword!! 
Satan… 
Thank you, Imperial Assault Troupe. 
But sadly, this does not mean an end to the fighting. 
Your true fight is just beginning.

Farewell, everyone. 
Hey! That's not a face a man should make. Pull yourself together! 
That is more acceptable. 
Fare thee well, Ogami.
