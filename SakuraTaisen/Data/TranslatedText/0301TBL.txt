﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿It's a photo of Sakura. She's looking right at me. I wonder what she's thinking…
It's a photo of Sumire. This is a side of her you don't see too often.
It's a photo of Maria. She's lost in thought and looks kind of sad…
A photo of Kanna. She looks strong and reliable. I can't wait to meet her.
A photo of Iris. She's surrounded by flowers and flashing a radiant smile.
A photo of Kohran. She's looking pretty in profile with her face dyed red by the evening sun.
A letter given to me by a customer. I was asked to give it to Sumire. I have a bad feeling about this…
Maria's pistol. This may help me escape from here…
A hair ornament. It's decorated with flowers and looks very elegant.
A pretty pendant. The delicate workmanship is gorgeous.
A hairpin for use in a traditional bun hairstyle. It would complement a formal outfit well.
This key will let me enter rooms I couldn't before.
I found this in a bedroom on the second floor. I can use it to access the back room.
A set of cups Iris asked me to get for her. They have a very stylish design.
This is the matchbox Iris asked for. Its logo is quite colorful.
Some knives Iris asked me to get for her. Just a normal utensil you'd use during a meal.
A prop sword and shield used onstage. They're well-made and look just like the real thing.
A prop crown used onstage. It's well constructed and incredibly detailed.
A wig and costume used onstage. I wonder what kind of act could use a flashy outfit like this?
A photo of Sakura in her swimsuit. Wow, this is really something. I'm gonna treasure this.
A photo of Sumire in her stage costume. Her distinctive makeup really makes an impact.
It's a photo of Maria on stage in the military uniform from "For Love"… She's a beautiful woman disguised as a man.
A photo of Kanna in her training gear. Catching her in a private moment like this feels surprisingly intimate.
A photo of Iris in her swimsuit. She's holding a rubber ring and looks ready to have some fun. How cute.
A photo of Kohran. I don't get to see her with her braids undone very often. It's a nice look.
A photo of Ayame in a traditional outfit. I hope she'll always be as happy and content as she is here.
Ayame's gun. Why…? Why did it have to turn out like this…?
Jean-Paul the teddy bear. Iris's best friend. She always carries him with her and takes good care of him.
The rainy season is in full force outside, so I suppose it wouldn't be so bad to spend a day in the library… 
It's a nice sunny day outside, but maybe I'll come back when it's raining and spend some time relaxing here. 
Phew… There's nothing as relaxing as coming back to your own room after a hard day's work… 
…Well, I've got nothing to do here. Maybe I'll go see what everyone else is doing. 
Let's see… is Sakura in her room? 
Guess I'll head somewhere else. 
…Guess no one's home. Maybe they aren't done cleaning up after the performance yet? 
Hm…? There's a name-tag on the door… 
“Kanna”? Oh, this must be the other member of the Flower Division Kasumi mentioned… 
Looks like this is… Kanna's room. 
Guess I'll head somewhere else. 
…Guess no one's home. But since there's a name tag, does that mean she'll be here soon? 
Maria said she was headed to the stage just a bit ago… She's probably already left her room. 
…Guess I'll head somewhere else. 
…Looks like no one's home. 
Is Kohran around? 
Guess I'll head somewhere else. 
…Guess no one's home. Maybe they aren't done cleaning up after the performance yet? 
Is Iris back in her room yet? 
OK. I'm gonna head somewhere else. 
…Looks like Iris is out. 
Sumire… Wonder if she's in her room. 
Guess I'll walk around a bit more. 
…Looks like no one's here. 
Sumire was drinking tea here just a bit ago… 
I'm pretty sure she said she was headed for the stage… 
Looks like Maria already headed out… 
The show's over, so it looks like all the guests have taken off. 
…Nobody here. Guess I'll head somewhere else. 
The show ended without a hitch. All the guests have already left. 
I wonder… where's everyone from the Flower Division at? 
During the rainy season it seems this room has a sort of sticky humidity… 
It'd be a waste of time to stick around in the watchman’s room with no one here, guess I'll head somewhere else. 
It's the manager's room. I wonder if Yoneda is in? 
OK. I'm gonna head somewhere else. 
Zzz… Zzz… 
Sounds like Yoneda fell asleep… 
I wonder if Sakura already headed backstage. 
…Nobody here. Guess I'll head somewhere else. 
Looks like Iris already left. I think she said she was headed to the stage… 
Maybe I should head over to the stage. I think everyone's there already. 
In the rainy season it's especially important to make sure the kitchen stays nice and hygienic. 
…Though, I guess there's no point in me thinking about that. I'm gonna head somewhere else. 
Looks like the number of guests is dwindling pretty quickly. 
I wonder… Where is everyone? Maybe I should check out the stage. 
The show's over, but the air of the theater still feels charged with excitement. 
Where is everyone? I guess by now they're all either backstage or in the dressing room. 
Even though the sun's shining outside, it's always a little dark in the warehouse… 
There's nothing for me to do here. I think I'll head somewhere else. 
The performance just ended, so no one's here training at the moment. 
…Guess I'll head somewhere else. 
The pool… Looks like no one's here. Dang. 
Well, nothing to do here. I think I'll head somewhere else. 
Since Kohran joined the Flower Division, our capabilities have grown. 
Now the only question is, can I be the captain they need me to be? Honestly, I think that's the hardest part. 
Kohran already took off, so there's no one here. 
…Well, nothing for me to do here. Guess I'll head out too. 
I can smell soap… and the air is just a little on the warm side. 
That's because Kohran just took a shower. 
…It's actually kind of humid with the heat. I think I'll head out. 
I've heard the medical pods are running off energy from an underground steam engine… 
…I just pray we never have a reason to use the pods… 
This is the Command Room, the heart of the Imperial Assault Troupe. When the alarms ring, this is where we gather. 
…But no one's here right now. Guess I'll go somewhere else. 
A steam processor… 
I've heard there are only a few this size in Japan. 
…Even if this thing was busted, I wouldn't know. I think I'll go somewhere else. 
This is where we hold all of our strategy meetings. 
Just like Kohran said, there's no one here. Guess I'll head somewhere else. 
Oh, Ogami. Welcome. 
Ah, Ogami. Can we help you? 
Oh, is that all you needed? 
Yep. Later. 
Can I help you? 
(She's got her scarf pinned with a brooch.) 
(I wonder what it's made of… Couldn't be a real jewel, right?)  
…Are you interested in this brooch? Oh, hey, listen to this. I actually got it super cheap at a bargain sale. 
…I see… 
(The way Yuri's hair curls away from her face is so charming…) 
(That bouncy look is pretty trendy.) 
Is something odd about my hair? Oh nooo, I've got some split ends! 
(Her face is small and balanced. I think even a model would be jealous.) 
(It doesn't seem like she uses much make-up. Well, she's got a nice foundation, I don't think she needs it…) 
What's wrong, Ogami? You've been staring at my face for a while. Haha, you're in love with me, aren't you!  
Hey now… You shouldn't tease adults! 
Hehehe… Sorry, Ogami. 
(Her eyes are shining with curiosity.) 
(Yumi's got a reputation for loving juicy gossip…) 
Hey, Ogami. Have you heard any good rumors lately? 
(Her clothes are pretty colorful.) 
(Maybe she's going for that popular bus guide look?) 
Something the matter, Ogami? 
No I was just thinking… your outfit is pretty cute. 
Oh, you noticed? I'm glad you like it! I actually coordinated this outfit myself. 
Huh… 
(Goodness… that's certainly an aggressive neckline…) 
(But… isn't this supposed to be a uniform?) 
Ahaha, Ogami. I see you've been stricken by my allure~! 
…Gimme a break! 
Oh, Ogami. I was just thinking when I was backstage a bit ago… 
Hm? 
…Maria doesn't look too well. 
At first I thought it was a problem with her makeup or the lighting, but… I wonder if she's getting enough sleep? 
(Maria… What's going on with her?) 
Hello, Yumi. How are you doing? 
Pretty horrible actually, Ogami. I hate this gloomy weather! Can't we do something about it? 
Well, it is the rainy season… I think it's out of our hands. 
I can't even get the laundry to dry. The only person that’s enjoying this weather is the umbrella salesman. 
Not many guests coming out in this weather either… 
Ogami, have you heard that there's places in Europe where they put roofs over the sidewalks? 
You can stroll around as dry as a bone in any weather. Man, can't wait for them to get some of those around here… 
Oh, hey, Ogami. Have you heard about Kanna? 
Kanna… I think I've heard that name before… 
That's Kanna Kirishima! She's been a member for a while, but recently she's been in Okinawa. 
She was supposed to come back a lot sooner, but I've heard she'll be arriving here shortly. 
Huh… 
She's amazing. Super strong and popular with kids, she's the kind of person you can really rely on… 
…Wow, what's her personality like? 
Well… That's something you should find out for yourself, Ogami. 
I guess that's true… 
Oh, Ogami! Recently a white dog has been showing up in the courtyard. 
Sumire has been feeding it. I never realized she liked animals that much. 
Really… Sumire? …I guess everyone has their hidden side. 
Wait, Ogami, “hidden”? What sort of personality DID you think Sumire had? 
Uh, um… Well… I can't really say. 
Ogami, seems like you've been pretty friendly with Sakura lately. 
R-Really, you think so? 
Sakura's really popular with all sorts of people, from kids to adults. 
Ogami, seems like you've been pretty friendly with Sumire lately. 
R-Really, you think so? 
Sumire's got this aura that makes her hard to approach, but that's actually become one of her selling points. 
She's always getting bouquets from young aristocrats. 
Ogami, seems like you've been pretty friendly with Maria lately. 
R-Really, you think so? 
Maria's popular among men AND women. Her performances are just that good. 
Ogami, seems like you've been pretty friendly with Iris lately. 
R-Really, you think so? 
It's pretty easy to see why Iris is so popular, though mostly just among our more elderly guests. 
Ogami, seems like you've been pretty friendly with Kohran lately. 
R-Really, you think so? 
Honestly… I really don't get where Kohran's popularity comes from… 
Oh, Ogami. I was just thinking when I was backstage a bit ago… 
Hm? 
…Maria doesn't look too well. 
At first I thought it was a problem with her makeup or the lighting, but… I wonder if she's getting enough sleep? 
(Maria… What's going on with her?) 
Can I help you? 
(That ribbon in her hair… it really suits her.) 
(It’s a charming look on someone as mature as Kasumi.) 
(Not a single hair out of place, nice and sleek.) 
(She really does have beautiful hair… She must spend a lot of time getting ready every day.) 
(Kasumi has a very calm expression…) 
(She looks gentle, but I bet she's scary if you make her angry… She's kind of the reliable older sister type.) 
…Is something the matter, Ogami? 
Oh, no, it's nothing, Kasumi.  
(There's a quiet, calm look in her eyes.) 
(Kasumi always looks people right in the eyes when she talks to them.) 
(Those traditional Japanese clothes look great on her.)  
(Her demeanor is so calm, but her movements have no openings I can see… I wonder if she has experience with martial arts.) 
(The neckline of that Japanese outfit is perfect on her…) 
…
(She's actually got quite a…) 
Ogami! This is really inappropriate… 
Ah, sorry… 
Oh, did I tell you? The guests were giving the latest performance rave reviews! 
Oh! That's good to hear. 
The play they were doing before, “For Love” was pretty good, but… 
…The stage got destroyed in the middle of the performance, so… 
Well, setting that aside, Sakura has been working her hardest after being awarded the role of Cinderella… 
Yeah, I'd say she is. 
Kohran as the mean stepsister and Sumire as the stepmother were pretty spot-on too… 
Hmm… Yeah, I'd say those roles might fit them perfectly. 
So this month was “Cinderella”… What are we doing next month? 
Next month the performance will be “Love is a Diamond”. 
Never heard of it. 
Ogami, do you know the story “The Golden Demon”? 
Yes, I've heard of it. 
“Love is a Diamond” is a modern take on “The Golden Demon”. 
A modern take, huh? Can't wait to see that. 
Oh, Ogami, hello. 
This month the performance is “Cinderella”! 
Maria is just so perfect as the prince, same as last month! 
(But, right now Maria is…) 
Ogami, is something wrong? 
No… it's nothing. 
Oh, Ogami. Did you need something else? 
Is there something on my face? 
Thanks for coming! Stop by again soon! 
I wonder if the manager is around. 
I guess I'll try somewhere else. 
Zzz… zzz… 
He's sleeping so soundly. I'd say he's really enjoying his nap. 
Well, I guess I'll go somewhere else. 
Yo, Ogamiii… howzit goin'? 
Um, pretty good… 
Whassa matter! That response was as bleak as those rainy clouds outside… 
It's a good thing Teito Tower made it through. It would have been a disaster if it had gone down. 
That's true… 
Plus I wouldn't have been able to hear the horse race results, which woulda been terrible too, right? 
…Right… 
Well, all joking aside. We performed a thorough search of Shiba Park after that, but… 
All we could figure out was that “something” had been buried in front of Teito Tower. 
But… you're going to dig it up right? 
We're trying… but we have no idea just how deep this thing is buried. 
I see… Well, let's keep at it. 
…Haha, I don't need you to tell me that. Just see to your own duties, ya hear? 
Yes, sir! Excuse me. 
Is Ayame around? 
Is Ayame back in her room yet? 
Maybe I'll try somewhere else. 
Looks like she's not here… I'll head somewhere else. 
Excuse me, Ayame. 
Oh, Ogami. Welcome. 
Come to think of it, this is our first time speaking officially, isn't it? 
…Ensign Ichiro Ogami… Have you gotten used to the Ginza Headquarters yet? 
(Wait… that pin on Ayame's neck…) 
(…That's a lieutenant colonel's pin! How could I have not noticed before?) 
…Ogami? 
…Ah, yes, Deputy Commander Fujieda, ma'am. 
Of course… This is the deputy commander's room after all. 
Haha, “deputy commander” sounds a little strange to me, so how about just “Ayame”, Ogami. 
Um… All right. 
But tell me, Ogami, were you surprised? By the nature of the Ginza Headquarters, I mean. 
Yes… very much so. Ah, but I think it's a very nice place. 
Haha, Ogami, your expression is quite stiff. No need to be so uptight. 
Oh… Of course. 
Ah, that reminds me, I was just writing up a report for Commander Yoneda… 
…A report? 
Yes, I write reports on various information regarding the Flower Division. 
It's a major part of my job. 
…I see. 
…This is a good opportunity. As the current captain of the Flower Division, is there anything you'd like to ask me? 
Ask for a battle report. <br> Ask for a casualty report. <br> No, thanks. 
I'd like to hear about how our last battle impacted the surrounding area. 
During the last battle you were able to protect Teito Tower from harm. 
Any further damage to the tower would have caused major problems with transmissions throughout the city. 
Ogami, your leadership was excellent. Please continue with this same standard of excellence. 
…O-Of course! Thank you, ma'am! 
…Unfortunately, during the last battle Teito Tower took significant damage. 
If we had been any later, it would have disabled Tokyo's ability to function as the heart of this country. 
…There is no excuse for my failure. 
No need to apologize to me. You were able to defeat the enemy, so we should count this as a victory. 
…Understood. 
…But, Ogami… 
I had thought you would be able to produce much more impressive results… 
Keep your chin up, Ogami! 
I'd like to hear the casualty report for the Flower Division from the last battle. 
Ogami… In a small unit like yours, the loss of a single member can cause irreparable damage. 
Though we should be grateful their life was spared. 
Of course… 
Sakura certainly isn’t weak, but she also isn’t the strongest. She needs proper support. 
Sumire has excellent combat capabilities, but you mustn't overestimate her. She needs proper support. 
Maria's defenses are weak, so you should avoid placing her in close-quarters combat situations. 
Kohran's attack power is weak, but she has a wide range. Take that into consideration when giving her orders. 
As the captain, you must provide sufficient support. Your aid strengthens the bonds of the unit. 
I'm trusting you to look after them, Ogami. 
Yes, ma'am! 
We took quite a lot of damage… You need to provide better support or your comrades will lose their faith in you 
Yes, ma'am… It was my failure. 
There were far too many casualties. Ogami… you're a failure as a leader! 
I need you to do better than this. 
Yes, ma'am… I'm deeply sorry. 
The Flower Division took relatively minor damage. Very well done, Ogami. 
You cared for those in your command and your judgment was spot-on. 
…Yes, ma'am! Thank you, ma'am! 
Shiba Park was on high ground, so your movements were limited, but… 
I think your leadership was excellent, including your utilization of Kohran for the first time. 
Also… Let's see. You shouldn't view these numbers as a complete reflection of the battle's outcome, but… 
The number of enemies destroyed should be used as one rubric to evaluate your troops. 
The one with the most enemies shot down during the last battle was Sakura. 
Sakura's technique shines when the enemies line up facing the same direction. 
Guide her well. You should predict where the enemy will move, and order Sakura accordingly. 
The one with the most enemies shot down during the last battle was Sumire. 
Sumire's technique is especially powerful when she is surrounded by enemies. 
However, that doesn't mean you should send her off alone. 
The one with the most enemies shot down during the last battle was Maria. 
Maria is perfect for the rear guard. She excels when she's firing over the shoulders of the front line. 
With her skills, you can trust that she'll never accidentally hit an ally. 
The one with the most enemies shot down during the last battle was Kohran. 
Kohran's bombs have a large explosion radius, so you should aim her attacks where enemies are clustered. 
This was Kohran's first battle, but she seems to have really given it her all. 
Her performance was truly inspiring. 
Take this as proof of her trust in you as a commanding officer, Ogami. 
You think so…? Well, thank you, ma'am. 
Oh, that reminds me… 
Oh, is that the time? I'm sorry, Ogami. I'm afraid I have some business to attend to. 
Oh… Of course. 
Look at me chatting the time away… You wouldn't have thought I'd be such a talker, would you? 
Wait, Ayame… 
(Dang… She left.) 
Ogami… about Sakura… 
Sakura? 
She's a newcomer here, just like you. 
…
But you're both working your hardest at your duties. From there… affection could bloom. 
(…Affection…) 
So, as her commanding officer, you need to support her well, Ogami. 
…Yes, ma'am! 
Ogami… about Sumire… 
Sumire? 
Haha, Ogami… 
You probably think Sumire is just a spoiled rich girl, don't you? 
…Well, I wouldn't put it quite like that… 
Really? Then perhaps you don't need me to tell you this, but… 
…
Regarding Sumire Kanzaki, you have to ask yourself, “was her upbringing really so blessed?” 
…I doubt even Sumire herself could answer that question… 
…Understood. 
When you want to form a tighter bond with your subordinates, you must first discard your preconceptions. 
Yes, ma'am! 
Sumire is kind, and has a strong sense of responsibility. Look after her properly, Ogami! 
…Understood, ma'am! 
Ogami… about Maria… 
Maria? 
The truth is… Maria was the commanding officer until you arrived. 
…
When it comes to commanding on the battlefield, Maria is unrivaled among her peers… 
You, of all people, should be well aware of that, Ogami. 
Of course… 
But… she has worries just like anyone else. In fact, in her case perhaps her worries are deeper… 
Worries…? 
You'll just need to ask her yourself about them. 
Oh come on! 
Haha, I suppose you could call this… homework. 
I-I see… Understood, ma'am. 
Ogami… about Iris… 
Iris? 
Iris really is still just a child. 
Of course… I understand that. 
Oh, you do? Tell me, Ogami, you've never raised a child, have you? 
Of course not! 
Ogami… children notice all sorts of things you wouldn't expect them to. 
…Really? 
…Well, Ogami, I know she'll be a bit of a handful for you, but… 
Please try to remember what it was like to be a child when you interact with her… All right? 
Of course… Understood, ma'am. 
Ogami… about Kohran… 
Kohran? 
The truth is… Kohran was originally meant to enter the Flower Division, but was sent to Hanayashiki instead. 
I see… 
The engineers at the Hanayashiki Branch were crazy about Kohran as soon as she arrived from China. 
(As I'd expect from Kohran…) 
After that, Kohran worked together with me in the Hanayashiki Support Department. 
…I doubt we would have completed the Koubus without her help. 
(Really… So she actually does more than make things explode…) 
But Kohran is much more delicate than you all think she is. 
…I see. 
Ogami… please take care of Kohran. 
…Yes, ma'am! 
Oh, are you done? 
Oh, is that all you needed? 
Ogami, I appreciate your interest, but… 
These photos are mainly for guests, so please just take one. 
Oh, I guess that's true. I'll come again some other time. 
You'd like to buy this photo? Thank you! 
That's a photo of Sakura. That'll be 50 zeni. 
We need to leave some for the guests, so just take one for now, OK? 
Ogami, I appreciate your interest, but… 
These photos are mainly for guests, so please just take one. 
Oh, I guess that's true. I'll come again some other time.

Oh, I guess that's true. I'll come again some other time.

She's very popular among young ladies and students. 
You'd like to buy that photo? Thank you! 
That's a photo of Kanna. That'll be 50 zeni. 
We need to leave some for the guests, so just take one for now, OK?

Most of the guys buying Iris's photo are older gentlemen. 
They always glance around nervously when they buy it. I wonder if they're worried what people will think?

Hmm… Kohran's fanbase is a bit of a mystery. 
Fool! You've let the Assault Troupe meddle in our plans again! 
Lord Tenkai… I believe I have a plan that could put an end to the Assault Troupe. 
Oh… and what is this plan of yours? 
The strength of the Assault Troupe is focused on its leaders, Ichiro Ogami and Maria Tachibana. 
So, if we just take those two out of the picture… 
You say that as if it's a simple matter… 
…I happen to have some very interesting information regarding Maria Tachibana… If we make good use of it… 
I see… Very well, Setsuna. I'll leave this in your hands… Crush the Imperial Assault Troupe! 
Yes, my lord!! Leave it to me… 
Hmhmhm… Every human has a skeleton in their closet they hope will never be unearthed… 
Well now, Maria Tachibana… how will you handle my little surprise? 
Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the Imperial Troupe, Flower Division’s performance of “Cinderella”. 
Thank you for joining us this evening. 
We hope you'll come visit us again soon. 
Man, I'm finally done punching tickets for the day… 
I should head somewhere and relax. 
Oh, it's Maria. Hey! Maria! 
…
Huh? Could she not hear me or something? 
Heeeeey! Maria! 
Oh, sir… 
What's the matter? I've never seen you space out like that. 
… 
Sir… I apologize for asking something so strange, but… 
Oh, uh… Yes? 
Do you ever… have dreams about the past? 
Sure… all the time. <br> Not really. <br> I dream about girls… 
Sure… all the time. I have dreams about when I was in officer school, and when I first came here. 
But… Why do you ask? 
Oh… It's nothing. 
Hey, Maria… 
…What's going on? She's definitely acting strange today. 
Hmm… No, I don't really have that kind of dream. 
But… Why do you ask? 
Oh… It's nothing. 
Hey, Maria… 
…What's going on? She's definitely acting strange today. 
I dream about girls… pretty much all the time. 
I see… Well, that's good for you. 
…Huh? 
Have you ever had a dream so painful it feels like… it's piercing you right through the heart? 
Maria… is something wrong? 
No… It's nothing. 
Hey, Maria… 
…Something's definitely off. I was sure she'd glare at me for saying that… 
Sorry… I need to be going… 
Hey, Maria… 
…What's going on? She's definitely acting strange today. 
Thanks for your hard work today, Ogami. 
Oh, Kasumi… You too. 
…Ogami, you were talking with Maria just now, right? 
…Yeah, but it was a really strange conversation. She definitely wasn't her normal self. 
…I was talking to Yuri just now, and… 
She said Maria messed up some of her lines in today's performance… 
I can't believe Maria would make mistakes like that… right? 
I wonder what's wrong… <br> Do you know anything? <br> Everyone makes mistakes. 
Hmm… I wonder what’s wrong. I don't think she'd get this depressed just from messing up a line or two… 
Are you worried, Ogami? 
Well yeah… We're squadmates, after all… 
Hehe… Are you sure that's the only reason? 
Hey, come on, don't tease me. 
Kasumi… do you know anything about what's going on with Maria? 
No, I don't… Sorry. 
I see… 
Well, I guess everyone makes mistakes. I don't think we really need to worry about Maria that much… 
True… but it just seems like Maria is always looking down around this time of year. 
…
Ogami, aren't you worried about her? 
Of course I'm worried, but… 
If only Kanna was around… 
Kanna? 
Oh, you haven't met Kanna yet, have you? 
Kanna Kirishima is one of the oldest Flower Division members, along with Maria. 
Since she's known Maria longer than anyone, I'm sure she could help us out with this. 
Oh, excuse me, young lady. I'd like a ticket for the next performance. 
Oh, I'm sorry. Right this way. 
Well then, Ogami, I'll see you later. 
…Well, now that I'm done working for the day I should go find somewhere to relax. 
Maybe I should look for Maria and try to talk with her a bit more. 
…Good grief, look at that person over there stuffing down food like there's no tomorrow… 
Looks like there's no one else here… I'll head somewhere else. 
Oh, Maria… 
Maria… 
Maria… 
Wha!? Oh, sir… 
What's the matter, Maria? You've been acting strange lately. 
…Sorry, sir. I didn't mean to worry you. 
I'm fine… Excuse me. 
…You don't look “fine” at all, Maria… 
But… I guess she just needs her space right now. 
It's the manager's room. I wonder if Yoneda is in? 
OK, guess I'll head somewhere else. 
Zzz… Zzz… 
Yoneda seems to have fallen asleep. 
Um… It's Ogami. 
Oh, Ogami. The door's open. 
Excuse me. 
Oh, Ogami. It's pretty rare for you to stop by my office. 
So… how can I help you? 
Ask about Maria. <br> Ask about the enemy. <br> Chat. 
Maria seems to be troubled lately. 
I see… so you're finally starting to worry about things like that… 
I don't think this is any time for jokes! I need to talk with you seriously about… 
About Maria, right? If you've noticed she's troubled, why come talk to me about it? 
You're her commanding officer, you should sort these things out yourself! 
B-But… 
Ah, get outta here! Looking at yer mopey mug will make my sake go sour! 
Y-Yes, sir! 
Commander Yoneda… I wanted to ask you about the Hive of Darkness. 
The Hive of Darkness, huh. They said their boss was a guy named Tenkai, right? 
I don't know what they're planning but, whatever it is, it can't be good for the Empire. 
Make sure you keep everything ship-shape so you can fight them at your very best! 
Y-Yes, sir! 
Now get outta here! I'm trying to take a nap. 
I wonder when this year's rainy season will end. 
Aw, don't say that, Ogami. It's great drinking sake while watching a steady drizzle outside. 
Of… Of course… 
But then again, it can get pretty nasty when you have to run out in the rain to get refills… 
…Oh crap! 
Speaking of which, I'm just about empty… Ogami, how would you like to go-… 
Sorry, sir! I just remembered something important I need to be doing right now! 
Oh come on, Ogami, don't be like that… 
What's the matter? Don't just stand there daydreaming. 
Um… 
Ah, get outta here! Looking at yer mopey mug will make my sake go sour! 
Y-Yes, sir! 
…As her commanding officer, huh… 
I should sort this out for myself. 
Phew… He was about to send me off on a crappy errand run… 
…He chased me out. 
Well, nothing to do here. I think I'll head somewhere else. 
I should talk with Maria for a bit. 
…I guess I'll go somewhere else. 
…Yes? 
It's Ogami. 
Sir… can I help you? 
I just wanted to talk with you a bit. 
Come in. The door is unlocked. 
Excuse me. 
Heh… This is my first time seeing your room. 
…Did you need something, sir? 
(If I leave now, there would be no reason for me coming in the first place…) 
Maria, what kind of hairstyle did you wear for your role today? 
… 
(Her eyes are a little red… Maybe she's not getting enough sleep.) 
Maria, your eyes are a little red. Are you getting enough sleep? 
Yes… 
(She's looking a little pale…) 
…You don't look so good. Are you feeling sick? 
No… I'm not sick… 
(She's looking a little pale.) 
Maria… are you feeling all right? 
Yes, I'm fine. 
(…I should probably avoid doing anything unscrupulous right now…) 
Maria… have you had trouble sleeping? 
…
(As expected, Maria's bookshelf is full of difficult-looking books.) 
That's a pretty nice desk. It looks good and sturdy. 
…
Maria… hat's going on with you today? You're not acting like your normal self. 
…
If it's OK… 
Tell me what's going on? <br> Talk to me anytime. <br> You don't need to tell me. 
Will you tell me what's going on? I could help you out, if you let me. 
…I'm sorry, sir. Please don't worry about me. 
I appreciate your camaraderie, but… this isn't something you could help with. 
Oh… I understand. 
Maria… I'm here for you, anytime you want to talk. 
I see… Thank you. 
…Never mind, you don't need to tell me. 
…Huh? 
Everyone's got worries. But in the end, overcoming them is something that's up to the individual. 
So… if you don't want to talk about it, I won't force you. 
Sir… Thank you. 
…Sir, is something wrong? 
S-Sorry. I just… I was just hoping I could help you out in some way… 
…Sir, just the fact that you're worried about me is enough. 
Excuse me, sir… I need to go help with taking care of the set. 
Sorry to leave so soon, when you took the time for a visit. 
Oh… I understand. I'll head out, then. 
Thank you, sir. Excuse me. 
…Right, I should be off myself. 
Oh, Ogami. Off for the evening? 
Yep. How was today's performance? 
I got to play the lead for the first time today! 
And, did you know we're doing “Cinderella” right now? I'm so happy! 
Hey, that's great to hear. 
But… something's been on my mind since the performance… 
Ayame, right? <br> Maria, right? <br> Me, right? 
Ayame, right? 
Well, her too. Ayame moved here last month, right? 
I think she's very dependable. Don't you? 
I've been going to her for advice quite a bit. 
Advice, huh. That sounds pretty good. Maybe I should go to her for some advice too… 
Haha, well then you should head to her room and see if she can help you. 
Well, I'd better be off… They want everyone to help take care of the set today. 
If you've got some time, you should come help too, Ogami. Excuse me. 
Taking care of the set… I should probably head over there myself in a bit. 
Maria, right? 
Yes… she mixed up quite a few of her lines again today. It's like she's a different person… 
And I don't think she's getting enough sleep lately either… I'm really worried about her. 
Ogami… if you have a chance, please try to talk to Maria. 
OK… I'll see what I can do. 
Well, I'd better be off… They want everyone to help take care of the set today. 
If you've got some time, you should come help too, Ogami. Excuse me. 
Taking care of the set… I should probably head over there myself in a bit. 
It's me, right? Man… it's hard being handsome. 
…I don't know what you're talking about. That's definitely not what I'm worried about! 
Haven't you noticed that Maria's been acting strange lately, Ogami? 
Oh… You're worried about Maria. Now that you mention it, yeah, she seems pretty down. 
Yes… she mixed up quite a few of her lines again today. It's like she's a different person… 
And I don't think she's getting enough sleep lately either… I'm really worried about her. 
Ogami… if you have a chance, please try to talk to Maria. 
OK… I'll see what I can do. 
Well, I'd better be off… They want everyone to help take care of the set today. 
If you've got some time, you should come help too, Ogami. Excuse me. 
Taking care of the set… I should probably head over there myself in a bit. 
…You may have noticed already, but Maria's been acting strange lately. 
She mixed up quite a few of her lines again today. It's like she's a different person… 
And I don't think she's getting enough sleep lately either… I'm really worried about her. 
Ogami… if you have a chance, please try to talk to Maria. 
OK… I'll see what I can do. 
Well, I'd better be off… They want everyone to help take care of the set today. 
If you've got some time, you should come help too, Ogami. Excuse me. 
Taking care of the set… I should probably head over there myself in a bit. 
Oh, Sumire. 
Well, if it isn't the Ensign. 
Nice job today. You're doing “Cinderella” this month, right? 
Yes. I've been cast as the evil stepmother. Seems I've only been getting roles like that lately. 
But I do love “Cinderella”, so I suppose I can put up with it. 
Oh? 
Ensign… 
Do you know why the fairy godmother sets Cinderella's magic to come undone at midnight? 
For the story to work, right? <br> That's how magic is. 
…Just for the story, right? If the magic didn't come undone, there wouldn't be a plot. 
Plebeian! Honestly Ensign… I don't think there's a single romantic bone in your body. That's not the point! 
Never mind! I'm needed at the stage. Excuse me! 
…? What got her all riled up? 
Because that's how magic is. A promise that could fade at any moment… that's magic. 
Ensign… I think I understand what you're saying. 
Magic that fades at the stroke of midnight is nothing more than a trick. 
That's not the kind of magic I want in my life. 
I see… That definitely seems like something you would say. 
What I want is… true “magic”. 
…True “magic”? 
…Yes. The power that can make a woman shine for all of eternity… 
…
…Oh, never mind. It would lack refinement for me to try to put it into words. 
Well, you'll have to excuse me. I am needed at the set. 
Hmm… I'm not really sure what that was all about… 
Oh, don't you know? 
Umm… 
…Perhaps you should give it some thought when you have time. 
Well, you'll have to excuse me. I am needed at the set. 
Hmm… I'm not sure. It seems like a complicated question… 
Looks like the guests are almost all gone for the evening. 
I wonder… where is everyone? Maybe I should check out the stage. 
The regulars are starting to remember me now… 
Hmm… Is it OK to feel happy over something like that? 
Oh, Ogami, hello. 
Today's performance was “Cinderella”! 
Maria is just so perfect as the prince, same as last month! 
(Well, right now Maria is…) 
Ogami, is something wrong? 
Oh… It's nothing. 
Oh, Ogami. Did you need something else? 
Is there something on my face? 
Ugh, it's horrible when it's this humid and your clothes get all damp. 
Yeah. It's even worse when you've got a tie around your neck. 
Man, I can't wait for a nice, dry summer to roll around. 
I wonder if Maria won't get too hot in the summer with that outfit of hers. 
H-Hey, Ogami! Where do you think you're looking? Stop! 
Ogami… come on, don't stare at me like that. It's embarrassing. 
Thanks for your business! Come again! 
Well, if it isn't the Chief. Whatcha up to? 
I could ask you the same thing, Kohran. 
I figured I'd relax with a nice shower after the show. I'm feeling 110% better! 
Can't beat a post-show shower, no sirree! 
(So she was taking a shower…) 
If only I got here sooner… <br> Want me to oil you up? <br> Where'd you put your glasses? 
Damn! If only I got here sooner… 
Uhh… 'Scuse me? Are you sayin' you woulda loved to be there to peep on me? 
Wha… No, no… 
Chief… I never would’a taken you for a closet pervert. You think you know a guy, jeez… 
Good thing I finished up quick. Guess I dodged a bullet. 
…Crap, now she's got the wrong idea. 
Though… uh, I guess she wasn't really wrong. 
Well, now that you're clean, should I oil you up? 
Ahahaha! Your jokes need a little work! 
I know I'm crazy about machines, but that doesn't mean you gotta oil me like one! 
Oh, yeah, I guess you're right… (Pretty sure there are oils for people too…) 
Well, see ya around. 
Oh, hey. I don't know where you were headed, but there's no one around in the basement. 
Everybody's getting together on stage to help take care of the set. 
Oh, so no one else is down here… 
Well, guess I'd better head out too. 
Kohran, what do you do with your glasses when you shower? 
I take 'em off of course. Can't wash my face with glasses on, now can I? 
Ahaha, guess with those off I wouldn't notice even if someone came in to peep on me. 
…Wait, Chief… that isn't why you asked, right? 
O-Of course not. I was just curious, that's all. 
Gotcha. I guess you've never worn glasses, so you wouldn't know. 
Well, see ya around. 
Oh, hey. I don't know where you were headed, but there's no one around in the basement. 
Everybody's getting together on stage to help take care of the set. 
Oh, so no one's down there… 
Well, guess I'd better head out too. 
Well, see ya around. 
Oh, hey. I don't know where you were headed, but there's no one around in the basement. 
Everybody's getting together on stage to help take care of the set. 
Oh, so no one's down there… 
Well, guess I'd better head out too. 
Hey… I can hear the shower going… and this locker is open. 
…! 
…These are Kohran's clothes, in the locker. So, right now she's…? 
C-Crap… Blood is rushing to my head… Make good choices, Ogami! 
I'm outta here! <br> I'm drawn to the shower… 
Going into the shower right now would be crossing the line. I'm outta here! 
Phew… I managed to get myself under control… 
C-Crap… I can't decide what to do! 
…Well I'm nice and toasty, guess I should go dry off. 
I'm dead! I need to get out of here! 
Phew… I managed to escape before she noticed. 
No… My body…it's moving on its own…toward the shower… 
(It's… K-Kohran… she's showering…) 
(Huh? She… She doesn't seem to realize I'm here.) 
Alrighty… Uh-oh… where are my glasses? 
(I see! Without her glasses, she can't see that I'm here!) 
(Wait… if she puts on her glasses…) 
Oh, here they are. What're you doing over here, glasses? 
(I'm done for! I need to run!) 
Phew… I managed to escape before she noticed. 
But man… I would have loved to keep looking a little longer. 
Phew, man that feels good. Oh, Chief. Whatcha up to…? 
Gah! K-Kohran! That was fast. 
Fast? What was fast? 
Uh, nothing, never mind… 
…You feelin' OK, Chief? I've gotta get going. See ya. 
Oh, hey. I don't know where you were headed, but there's no one around in the basement. 
Everybody's getting together on stage to help take care of the set. 
Phew… She didn't notice… I'm safe. 
…OK, let's get out of here. 
Hey Iris, so this is where you were. 
Oh, Mon Frère! We finally got some nice weather today! 
Yeah. It's rare to get nice sunny days like this during tsuyu. 
“Tsuyu”? What's that? 
Oh… I guess you didn't have it in France. Tsuyu is… 
…the June rainy season. <br> …when the rain stagnates. 
It's what we call the rainy season in June. Once it's over, it'll be time for summer. 
Mon Frère, you're so smart! That's why you're my boyfriend! 
I love summer, so I wish tsuyu would be over already! 
Hahaha, so you like summer best, huh? 
Yep! We should go to the beach together sometime, Mon Frère! 
OK, I need to go. They want me to help take care of the set. 
See you later. 
Taking care of the set, huh. They could probably use some extra muscle, so I should head over there too. 
Well, see, tsuyu is what we call the condition when the rain fronts accumulate in this area. 
…What does any of that mean? I don't know those words! 
Oh, yeah, sorry. Um… Well, tsuyu is basically… 
…Never mind. It sounds complicated. 
I have to go. They want me to help take care of the set. See you! 
…I think my explanation was a bit too much for her. 
Taking care of the set, huh. They could probably use some extra muscle, so I should head over there too. 
Uh… I'm not sure how to explain it… 
…Never mind. It sounds complicated. 
I have to go. They want me to help take care of the set. See you! 
Taking care of the set, huh. They could probably use some extra muscle, so I should head over there too. 
Oh, Chief! Good timing. 
What's up? 
Ensign, this set piece looks like it's about to collapse. Could you hold it up for us? 
We were all thinking we should fix it up… right, Maria? 
Huh…? Oh, yes, that's right. 
Hey, Maria, you don't sound so good. Are you OK? 
I'm fine, don't worry. Come on, let's focus on the set. 
Gah! The set!! 
Kyaaaaa!! O-Ogami!! 
Ooooooooo!! Damn this is heavy! 
Yiiiikes… Now that's impressive. You've got some real muscle in those guns, Chief! 
…Thanks, but could you maybe do something about this?! 
I-I'll go get some rope! 
Mon Frère, are you OK? You're sweating a lot. 
Pretend it's nothing. <br> Call for help. 
Ha, ha, ha…this…is nothing… 
Ensign… I don't know who you're trying to impress, but now really isn't the time. 
Sumire! How can you say that! 
You can do it, Ogami! We'll pull it off of you as quick as we can. 
You got this, Chief! Put your back into it!! 
I'll wipe your sweat for you, Mon Frère! 
Wah… Hey, stop! That tickles! 
S… Somebody help! I… I can't hold on…! 
Don't say that! You've got this, Chief! 
What should we do? Should we call Mr. Yoneda? 
And what would he do? He'd die of a strained back! 
I don't care what you do, just do something fast! 
Keep it up, Mon Frère! I'll cheer for you! 
(Ku… guhhhh…) 
I-I can't hold it!! 
(Ku… I-I've got to hold on! Put your back into it, Ichiro Ogami!!) 
Oh my… he's really serious about this, isn't he? 
That's our boy! You got this, Chief! Show us what you're made of!! 
You can do it, Ogami! We'll pull it off of you as soon as we can. 
Keep it up, Mon Frère! I'll cheer for you! 
(Ku…ugh… I… I can't hold it anymore…) 
I-I can't hold it!! 
Kyaaaaaa! Mon Frère!! 
Iris! Get out of the way! 
…Huh? 
…Huh?? Mon Frère… we're alive? 
Hah, that's pretty sad… can't even lift this much? 
Hey, glasses, get a rope on this thing and pull it up! 
(Incredible… she's holding up the set with a single hand…) 
R… Roger… 
Who… are you…?
