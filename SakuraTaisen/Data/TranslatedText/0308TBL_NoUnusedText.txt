... just a dream. 
Why... do I keep going back to that day... 
...... 
...an enemy!? 
...it seems misfortune breeds misfortune... 
Is everyone here? 
No... Maria still hasn't arrived. 
Maria is late? She's never late. 
Forgive me for being late! 
Talk to Kanna. <br> Talk to Maria. 
Kanna, it's been a while since you sortied, right? Take care out there. 
Thanks, boss. I'm looking forward to seeing your fighting style. 
You should be able to fight harder than ever before, with my special cooking in you. 
Commander Yoneda, what information do we have on the enemy? 
Maria... are you alright? You don't look so good... 
...thank you, but I'm fine. 
Commander Yoneda, please update us on the Hive of Darkness. 
Hey, don't just stand there like a moron, Ogami! 
R, right! Sorry, sir! 
Commander Yoneda, will you tell us about the enemy, please? 
Right. Looks like everyone's here, so let's start our strategy meeting. 
We've received reports from some civilians that Hive of Darkness Hex Mechs have appeared in Tsukiji. 
Tsujiki? 
The Hex Mechs have gathered in a block of abandoned buildings near the mouth of the river. 
There doesn't seem to be a direct civilian threat, but we need to put this threat down quietly before it causes a panic. 
I see... understood. 
Kanna's been out of the saddle for a while. Make sure to take good care of her, Ogami! 
But... thanks! 
Alright, everyone! Time to show the world the might of the fully assembled Imperial Combat Revue! 
Imperial Assault Force, move out!!
