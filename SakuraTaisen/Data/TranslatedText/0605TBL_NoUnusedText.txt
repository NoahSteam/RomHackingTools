(…If you look closely, she's still wearing her stage hairdo.) 
(…She must have come here in a big hurry after the play ended.) 
(Her hair is as wild as always.) 
(It's Kanna's trademark headband. It always looks so good on her.) 
(I've heard that the store even sells "Kanna Headbands" for her kid fans.) 
(Wow…You don't usually see Kanna looking like this.) 
(I wonder what happened here…? Kanna's got a troubled look in her eyes.) 
(I wonder if she ran out of time… Her clothes are a little disheveled.) 
(Why was Kanna in such a rush?) 
(Oho?! Maybe it's my imagination, but it seems like I can see more than usual…) 
(No! I can't believe I'm staring at Kanna's chest while she's upset…What am I doing?!) 
(O-oh nooo! My eyes are drawn like a magnet to her breasts!) 
Captain…just what have you been looking at?! 
Sakura… 
(Her hair is a glossy black.) 
Um… Ogami. Could you please listen to what I have to say? 
(She looks so sad. I've never seen Sakura like this before…) 
(The incident with the lightning must have given her a bad shock…) 
Um… Ogami. 
(This is no time for me to be doing that!) 
(…At any other time, I'd want to look even more…) 
Um… Ogami. Could you please listen to what I have to say? 
(Compared to her usual cheerful self, Sakura seems totally depressed…) 
… 
Is it about that lightning earlier? 
… 
…… 
…… 
…You mean he was struck by lightning? 
Oh, no… but to be honest, I was surprised to see you so out of sorts. 
Not at all… I was just a little surprised that you were so shaken up. 
W-what was that?! Uwaaaah!! 
Ohohohoho! The spirit I sent has proven more useful than expected! 
Now that I've found their base, the Imperial Theater is nothing more than a group of little girls! 
Now, Crimson Wasp Corps! Turn this puny theater into a mountain of rubble! 
Damn! A surprise attack?! The Hive of Darkness are a bunch of cowards! 
That red battlesuit… It's the same one that was at Fukagawa…C rimson Miroku! 
But… Uncle Ichi and Sakura aren't here yet! 
Wow… I guess I really did something awful to her… 
Listen, team! The five of us must hold our ground! 
The captain and Sakura will be here soon! Until then, we must defend the Imperial Theater with our lives! 
Roger! 
Now I can settle our score from Fukagawa! 
I'm gonna do my best too! 
We'll make them pay for crashing our party! 
…… 
A mere five units can't hold out for long against so many enemies. 
At this rate… we're all done for! 
Captain Ogami… Sakura… Please hurry! 
Hold on, Sakura!! 
(This sound isn't thunder… it's explosions. It can't be… the Hive of Darkness?!) 
O-oh no! Sakura, get down! 
C-crap! The entrance is covered with debris! 
…Sakura! 
(I've got to calm her down somehow… I know!) 
Hug her tightly. <br> Speak to her gently. 
Sakura, forgive me! 
Sakura… 
Ogami… 
It's all right now…I'm here with you. 
(At a time like this, nothing I say will get through. All I can do is hold her!) 
Sakura… 
…! 
Sakura… you don't have to worry about the Thunder God anymore. 
I won't let go of you. 
As long I hold you like this, the Thunder God won't be able to see you. 
Yes, everything will be fine. It's all right. I'm here for you. 
Sakura… You seem self-conscious about being scared of thunder… 
But it's nothing to be ashamed of. 
The thunder can do its worst… I'll protect you, and so will everyone from the theater! 
Do you understand? 
…All right. Now, let's think of a way to get out of this dressing room. 
Damn it! The walls and ceiling have crumbled, and the exit is blocked! 
…So we're completely sealed in. 
If we could somehow deal with the broken wall, we'd be able to break free… 
Maybe we could use a bomb to break apart the stone and get outside? 
Seeing as I'm not Kohran, I tend not to go carrying bombs around… 
Isn't there something we can do about this broken wall…? 
The broken wall is blocking the exit… 
…So we're completely sealed in. 
Without us… the others must be fighting the enemy with only 5 Koubu… 
…It will be a tough battle. I hope… they'll be all right… 
Ogami… I know there must be a way for us to get out of here! 
Don't give up…We'll figure something out! 
The exit is completely blocked. We have to think of something… 
That's true… 
This wall… It may have been weakened, but not enough for human strength to break through it. 
You're right… If only we had some equipment to break it with… 
Hmmm, would there be anything like that in the dressing room? 
All we have to do is break this wall… damn it! 
Is there anything lying around on the floor? 
I'll look too. 
Sakura… Have you found anything? 
No… Things from the lockers are scattered all over the place, but none of it looks useful… 
God damn it! There's noise coming from below us! Has the enemy entered through the basement? 
(Calm down… Calm down and think. How can we escape?) 
Ogami! I found this in the shadow of a locker! 
That's… Maria's training gun… 
…It must have burst out of her locker when the wall collapsed. 
Bullets… Oh! As luck would have it, this thing is loaded! 
All right… With this, we just might be able to break that wall! 
Really?! So we can free ourselves and go help the others! 
Yeah… Let's hurry! I'm worried about them. 
Ohohohohohohoho! Finished already? It seems the Imperial Theater is all bark and no bite! 
It's time for you and your precious theater to go to sleep… forever. 
Ooohohohoho! 
…I hate to admit it, but the odds are against us. And yet… 
And yet, if… Sakura were with us… then maybe… 
If Uncle Ichi were here, we'd be unbeatable! 
Not good… We've just about had it! We can't hold them back much longer… 
Captain Ogami… Sakura… Hurry…! 
…This should do it… 
We'll blow up this wall! The blast itself won't have much power… 
But as long as we get the mechanics right, it should be enough of an explosion to break the stone. 
Yeah, leave it to me!! Believe it or not, I was top of my class in the military academy. 
…But one mistake, and we'll both be buried alive… nothing for it but to take our chances. 
…… 
Do you trust me…? 
…Thank you. Well, here goes. 
Sa-Sakura… What was that light…? 
I-I don't know… I was frantic… 
I wanted to save you… That was the only thing on my mind as I ran forward. 
But… why was I… able to use so much power…? 
(All the girls in the Flower Division have high spirit energy…) 
(But that power just now… was it really only spirit energy?) 
…Anyway, we can figure that out once we've taken care of the enemy! 
Let's go, Sakura! The others are waiting for us! 
Yes, sir! 
Everyone… hold on! We'll be there to help you soon! 
OK, we've made it out! 
I can hear explosions below us! It sounds like the enemy has found a way in through the basement. 
That's a blessing in disguise for us! It means we can use the Koubu! Let's get to work, Sakura! 
Yes, sir! 
They may have thought they'd take us by surprise by entering through the basement… but we're ready for you, Hive of Darkness!

I'd like to speak with you alone… 
I… I was a tomboy as a child… 
I had a friend named Takeshi who I used to play and fight with… 
One day, Grandma told me I couldn't play outside, but I invited Takeshi out anyway… 
We were climbing trees. Then, suddenly… the sky turned pitch black… 
Sakura, the Thunder God is angry! Hurry, we've gotta hide… 
I'm fine! I'm not scared of some stupid Thunder God! 
Takeshi! Takeshi! Takeshiii! 
Takeshi was taken by the Thunder God. 
All because I didn't listen to my grandma… 
Unused
Ever since then… I've been scared of the Thunder God… scared that someday, I'll be taken away like Takeshi… 
Silly, isn't it? Me, a pilot who rides the Koubu into battle, afraid of the Thunder God… 
Kyaaaaah?! 
Yes… T-the Thunder God is angry…

Oh, I'm so embarrassed, I could die… I didn't want you to see me like that, Ogami… 
Ogami… thank you so much. 
Huh?! O-Ogami… 
W-why?! 
Heehee! Really now, Ogami… 
B-but… 
Ogami… 
Are you sure you can do this? 
Yeah!
