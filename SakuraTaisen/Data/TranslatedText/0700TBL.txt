﻿It's a photo of Sakura. She's looking right at me. I wonder what she's thinking… 
It's a photo of Sumire. This is a side of her you don't see too often. 
It's a photo of Maria. …She's lost in thought and looks kind of sad… 
It's a photo of Kanna. Kanna's signature strength comes through clearly. 
It's a photo of Iris. She's surrounded by flowers and flashing a radiant smile. 
It's a photo of Kohran. She's looking pretty in profile with her face dyed red by the evening sun. 
A letter given to me by a patron. I was asked to give it to Sumire. I have a bad feeling about this… 
Maria's pistol. This may help me escape from here… 
A hair ornament. It's decorated with flowers and looks very elegant. 
A brooch. It's a beautiful piece of delicate craftsmanship. 
A hairpin for use in a traditional bun hairstyle. It would complement a formal outfit well. 
Jean-Paul the teddy bear. Iris's best friend. She always carries him with her and takes good care of him. 
This key will let me enter rooms I couldn't before. 
I found this in a bedroom on the second floor. I can use it to access the back room. 
A teacup Iris asked me to get for her. It has a very stylish design. 
This is the matchbox Iris asked for. Its logo is quite colorful. 
A knife Iris asked me to get for her. Just a normal utensil you'd use during a meal. 
A prop sword and shield used onstage. They're well-made and look just like the real thing. 
A prop crown used onstage. It's well-constructed and incredibly detailed. 
A wig and costume used onstage. I wonder what kind of act could use a flashy outfit like this? 
It's a photo of Sakura in her swimsuit. Wow, this is really something. I'm gonna treasure this. 
It's a photo of Sumire in her stage costume. Her distinctive makeup really makes an impact. 
It's a photo of Maria on stage in the military uniform from "For Love"… She's a beautiful woman disguised as a man. 
It's a photo of Kanna in her training gear. Catching her in a private moment like this feels surprisingly intimate. 
It's a photo of Iris in her swimsuit. She's holding a rubber ring and looks ready to have some fun. How cute. 
It's a photo of Kohran. I don't get to see her with her braids undone very often. It's a nice look. 
It's a photo of Ayame in a traditional outfit. I hope she'll always be as happy and content as she is here. 
Ayame's gun. Why…? Why did it have to turn out like this…? 
Ayame! How is Sakura? 
We brought her straight to the infirmary… But she hasn't regained consciousness yet. 
I see… I really wonder why she passed out… 
Ogami… You worrying about her shows how close you two are. 
No, it's just… 
Well, no matter. Please, go in. 
Y-yes. 
Sakura is inside the medical pod… 
But she's unconscious. She's been like this since she passed out. 
We brought her to the infirmary straight away… 
Please, check how she's doing. 
(I thought nothing could ever upset Ayame, but even she seems worried…) 
Where are you going, Ogami!? Don't you want to see how Sakura's doing? 
Cut that out please, Ogami! Just go and see how Sakura is doing. 
Sakura! It's me, Ogami! 
… 
Sakura! It's me, Ogami! 
…… 
Sakura… Please, answer me… 
It's no use, she's out for good. Even if a bomb fell down on us, she wouldn't notice. 
(There doesn't seem to be an injury anywhere on her body…) 
(It's heartbreaking to see her like this…) 
(Damn! Is there nothing I can do?) 
Sakura, please get up… You were always so full of energy. 
… 
(I've never seen her so expressionless… It's like she was a different person.) 
Sakura… Please, open your eyes. Look at me… 
…… 
(Sakura…) 
Sakura… Please answer me. Just say something… 
…… 
If you sleep like that, you'll catch a cold… The god of thunder will take your navel! 
So, please… wake up! Sakura… 
Why… Why don't you come to? What's causing this? 
(*Gulp* No! At a time like this, that would be just wrong!) 
(But still… It's impossible not to look…) 
Ogami… What are you staring at? 
Er, me?! 
(Ayame's going to get angry. I'd better avert my eyes.) 
(Not a stitch of clothing on her…) 
(I shouldn't think like this, but… She's really beautiful!) 
Hmph… This reflection is really annoying… 
Do you realize you said that out loud? 
Wha…?! I'm… I'm sorry! 
(Ayame's going to get angry. I'd better avert my eyes.) 
Where are you going, Ogami!? Don't you want to see how Sakura's doing? 
Cut that out please, Ogami! Just go and see how Sakura is doing. 
Where are you going, Ogami!? Don't you want to see how Sakura's doing? 
No idea… The only thing I know is the energy flow in her body is extremely high. 
Even though she's unconscious? 
This is just a theory, but… 
Perhaps the shock earlier put her in a state of trance… 
What's happening to her? <br> What's a state of trance? 
So… What's happening to her? 
We don't have any way to wake her up currently… 
That means the Flower Division has lost an important part of its fighting capabilities. 
That can't be! Ayame… Please tell me that's not true! 
I'm sorry… I can't believe I'm saying this myself… 
A state of trance? What's that? 
It's like she's hypnotized. 
Hypnotized!? 
She was hit by the spirit energy that was released when the seal was opened. 
Her mind is probably in an extremely unstable condition. 
As long as she doesn't want to wake up of her own will… there's not much we can do. 
No… It can't be! 
… 
Ogami… You seem to have lost your voice from the shock… 
You have to be strong, especially at a time like this. 
Y-yes… 
…Sakura seems to be in some sort of of hypnosis and won't wake up. 
As long as she doesn't want to wake up of her own will… there's not much we can do. 
No… It can't be! 
Sakura! Are you all right?! 
Mon Frère! What's up with Sakura? Please say she's fine! 
…Ensign. What's her status? 
W-well… 
Tell the truth. <br> Dodge the question. <br> Act cheerfully. 
Sakura… seems to be in a state of trance. 
What?! 
…A state of trance?! 
Sakura… 
Hey, Kanna. What's a "state of trance"? 
Well, er… 
She fell asleep and doesn't wake up. 
No worries. She isn't hurt… She's just sleeping. 
Then why is she in that medical pod? That doesn't make sense if she isn't hurt! 
Didn't she bump her head? That would be awful. 
Mon Frère… Will Sakura really be OK? 
Yes… of course! As soon as she wakes up, she'll be right as rain. 
…I see. OK. 
…Hahahaha! Don't worry! There's not a scratch on her! 
For real? I was worried for a sec… 
Then let's go see her. 
Er, yeah, OK. 
But… I'm still a bit worried. 
There's nothing to worry about. This is Sakura we're talking about. She's tough. 
…Exactly. Sumire is right. 
…… 
She's not really all right, is she? 
What!? Come on, Mon Frère, tell me… How is Sakura? 
Hee hee… Just kidding. 
Huh…? 
A-Ayame…? 
Sakura is all right. There isn't a scratch on her. She must have been born under a lucky star. 
Hey… Wait a minute! Are you joking? Don't scare people like that! 
Oh, I'm… I'm sorry, everyone. (Did Ayame trick them on purpose?) 
… 
She just needs a little rest, then she'll be all right. 
I know we're all worried about Sakura, but let's start the strategy meeting. 
You're right. Come on, everyone. To the command room. 
…… 
(The city is under threat, and Sakura is still unconscious… This isn't good…) 
Captain… Everything OK? You're frowning… 
Kanna… 
Smile. <br> Confess your worries. 
Hahaha, I'm fine! The fight is only just beginning. We can't be moping around now. 
Sorry to make you worry… What about you, Kanna? Are you all right? 
Hm, well… Not really, to be honest. 
The Hive of Darkness is acting up, and Sakura's in that pitiful state… 
Oh shoot… I wanted to cheer you up, but now I'm only contributing to the doom and gloom… 
A frown doesn't suit you, Kanna! Come on, cheer up! 
OK. Thanks, Captain! 
Well… I'd be lying if I said I wasn't worried. 
Captain! Please stop! 
K-Kanna… 
Worried, afraid… Those are words I didn't want to hear from your mouth. 
I was sure you'd know what to do… 
…I'll go ahead. See you there, Captain. 
Kanna… 
She's right… I shouldn't let everyone see my insecurities. I have to keep their spirits up. 
…… 
Strong, silent type, huh? It's incredible how you don't show any signs of fear, at a time like this. 
I'd love to be as strong as you. 
Kanna… 
Yoohoo, Chief! Everything alright? 
Kohran… 
Smile. <br> Confess your worries. 
Er… Yoohoo! Feeling right as rain, Kohran! 
You can't fool me, Chief. 
Huh…? 
Your face is smiling, but deep down you're afraid, I can see that. 
Kohran… 
Well… I'm afraid too, you know. 
But you're the captain… Even if you're feeling insecure, you can't show it, right? 
That's true… 
Hey, Chief… 
…Hm? 
This is the moment of truth! We have to stay strong and give it our all! 
…Damn straight! 
That's more like it! And remember, I always got your back. 
Kohran… 
OK, see ya, Chief… 
Somehow I find it hard to be so energetic as you, Kohran… 
You've been something of a stranger lately, boss. 
Sorry. 
I'm scared stiff, you know… I just act like this to make it go away… 
Haha… 
Look, let's try again, OK? Woohoo! 
Er… Woohoo! 
I'm feeling awesome! 
I'm… I'm feeling awesome! 
See? A smile suits you better than that deathly frown from before! 
Thanks, Kohran. 
OK, see ya, boss… 
…… 
Geez, sorry I said anything… That kind of sullen face really gets me down, you know. 
Sorry. 
It's OK, boss… I know you have to deal with more than we can imagine. 
And you're all alone while doing it. 
Kohran… 
You've grown strong, boss. But… You can depend on us once in a while, you know? 
That's what friends are for. 
Thanks, Kohran. 
OK, see ya, boss… 
(Waaah!? Someone's covering my eyes from behind!) 
Is that you, Kohran? <br> Is that you, Maria? <br> Is that you, Sumire? 
Is that you, Kohran? 
You can't be serious! Do I talk as sloppy as that street kid?! 
Is that you, Maria? 
Did you forget that Maria is always wearing gloves? Don't tell me you forgot my hands. 
Is that you, Sumire? 
Hohoho… There's no mistaking my sonorous voice, is there? 
Hahaha, no doubt about it. It's you, Sumire! 
Not bad, Ensign! 
Oh…? 
…You really can't tell? You're not very sharp, are you? 
It's me, Sumire! But I have to say, your gaucheness is part of your charm. 
Wha…? Oh, Sumire! 
I didn't think you'd be THAT slow on the uptake… 
S-sorry… 
It's just… You're not usually one to joke around like this. 
Thank her. <br> Act nonchalantly. 
Thank you, Sumire. You brightened up my mood a little. 
That's exactly what I intended. Do you think I'd joke around without purpose? 
But I hope you know I wouldn't do this for anyone else. 
No, you're the only one… I wanted to make you feel better. 
Sumire… 
W-well, anyway… I have to excuse myself now. See you later, Ensign. 
I'm fine, Sumire. You really don't have to worry about me. 
You wanted to cheer me up, right? 
I… No, it's… 
I just… I like to fool around once in a while… Oho, ohohohoho! 
W-well, anyway… I have to excuse myself now. See you later, Ensign. 
…You aren't going to say anything? 
You're different from the other men… Even in the face of adversity, you won't utter one word of complaint. 
But… please know that sometimes it's fine to open up. 
You always listen to my whining… You have the right to whine yourself once in a while. 
…Thanks, Sumire. 
(Whaaa! Someone's covering my eyes from behind!) 
Is that you, Kanna? <br> Is that you, Iris? <br> Is that you, Sakura? 
Is that you, Kanna? 
Bzzzzt! Wrong! It's me, Iris! 
Wha…?! 
Hehehe! Did I surprise you, Mon Frère? 
Is that you, Iris? 
Hehehe… You caught me! Not bad, Frère! 
How could I mistake you for someone else? 
Hehe, that makes me happy! 
(Iris…) 
(Wait a second… How did she reach up to my eyes!?) 
Is that you, Sakura? 
Come on! Why would Sakura be here? 
…… 
Oh, sorry… Iris. 
Iris… 
(Wait a second… How did she reach up to my eyes!?) 
… 
Are you mad, Mon Frère? 
I'm sorry… You looked all gloomy, so I thought… 
…… 
Iris… 
(Wait a second… How did she reach up to my eyes!?) 
Scold her. <br> Play along. 
Iris! This is hardly the time for fun and games! 
I… sniff… I just thought you looked so sad, and… 
That's why I… I wanted to… cheer you up. 
Wait, please hold on… Don't cry, Iris! 
…? 
I didn't understand what you were up to, I'm sorry! 
So… sniff… you're not mad, Frère? 
Of course not! 
Are you feeling… better? 
I'm fine, I'm fine! 
Yay, I'm so happy! 
(I have to make it up to her…) 
Who is it? 
Huh? Hahaha! I can't see anything! Is that your revenge for earlier? 
Exactly… So, who am I? 
Hahahaha! Mon Frère of course! 
Ding dong! Correct answer! 
That was fun! You look much happier now, Frère! And that makes ME happy! 
Ah… Iris. Were you worried about me? 
Of course I was… After all, we're gonna be married some day! 
I have to look out for my future husband! 
…… 
Come on… Cheer up, Mon Frère. 
When you're frowning like that, I get all worried. 
Iris… 
You're always making that face… always thinking about complicated things. 
You're always concerned about everyone else. But… 
…… 
I love you, so I want to help you… 
So… please cheer up, OK? 
Iris…… 
Hehehe… 
See you later, Frère! 
Thank you, Iris. 
Captain… Are you OK? You look a bit pale. 
Maria… 
Smile. <br> Confess your worries. 
Hahaha, I'm fine! The fight is only just beginning. We can't be moping around now. 
Sorry to make you worry, Maria. 
It's alright. This is about all I can do right now. 
We're in a right pickle, aren't we, Captain Ogami? 
You see right through me, Maria. 
But at a time like this, you have to be stronger than ever in order to keep up morale. 
Please do your best! 
You're right… I will! 
I have to admit, I'm a bit worried. 
Captain… That's… 
You, Maria? Whatever happens, you stay calm. I envy you. 
To tell you the truth, Capain… I'm worried myself. 
…… 
But I made a decision. Never falter, never hesitate… 
And above all, no regrets. You should stop moping, Captain. 
No regrets…? I guess it's my duty to keep everyone's spirits up… 
Maria… Thank you. 
Don't mention it. 
…… 
You've really grown strong, Captain. 
Huh…? 
Until a while ago, you would have depended on someone else in such a situation. 
You're right… 
But I figured I'm the one who should talk to you then. 
Maria… 
And I'm… No… Forget about it. 
Please excuse me. 
(Everyone's here. Well, except Sakura.) 
I won't budge! <br> Calm down, Lt. General! 
I won't budge! We can't let you go alone, Lieutenant General! 
What!? 
You shouldn't go meet Tenkai alone… We should all go, as the Imperial Floral Assault Troop, Flower Division! 
And we won't go there to lay down and die. 
The Flower Division will move out to defeat Tenkai… and to protect the capital! 
Ogami… 
Please calm down, Commander! We haven't lost yet! 
Sakura might not be there, but the Flower Division is as strong as ever. The Koubu and the Shogei-Maru are ready! 
Commander, the Captain is right. 
If we're too hasty, we're playing right in their hands. We have to consider all options carefully. 
Yeah… You're right, I'm sorry. 
Please calm down, Commander! We need to think carefully before making a move! 
If we're too hasty, we're playing right in their hands. 
We're not defeated yet. This fight has yet to be decided! 
Yeah… You're right, I'm sorry. 
What about the police… the army, the navy? 
Did you already forget? Their weapons are not match for the Black Web… 
Plus, they've got their hands full with evacuating all the citizens. 
No… This time, there might be no way out. They're just too many… 
Many? How much do you think? 
They're spilling out of seven places in the capital simultaneously. More than 1,000 at each location. 
So at least 7,000, in all… 
Damn it! There's no way we can fight them all… 
And all that without Sakura… What should we do, Frère? 
We can't give up! <br> Calm down, everyone! 
We can't give up! While we're arguing, people are suffering! 
Sure, the situation is dire. We're in the biggest crisis since our inception. 
Calm down, everyone! Sure, the situation is dire. We're in the biggest crisis since our inception. 
What do you think will happen if we just despair? While we're here, people are suffering out there! 
But… We shouldn't forget everything that led us here. 
We had many tough fights to overcome. But we pulled through, didn't we? 
We made mistakes, we got into huge trouble… 
But in the end, we always won. If we stand together, we're invincible! 
Think of everything we've gone through until now. 
None of those battles were easy. We always got into tough spots, but never gave up. 
We made mistakes, we quarreled… Sometimes we got into real big trouble. 
But by standing together, we braved all those adversities and came out victorious! 
That's right. If we give up now, the last beacon of hope goes dark! 
The Captain is right. We can't waver. This is the battle that will decide everything! 
Maria is right. We can't waver. This is the battle that will decide everything! 
This is like listening to little children. How do you propose we fight against 7,000 enemies? 
I hate to say it… But Sumire's right. The difference in numbers is just too overwhelming. 
We'll be dead at four o'clock. 
Hey, Frère! You already thought of something, right? Right? 
(Iris…) 
(Tenkai announced they'd destroy the capital at 4 in the morning. That's only… about 1 hour from now.) 
(You gotta think, Ogami. What… What should we do!?) 
If we attack their base… <br> Strengthen Tokyo's defenses. 
I know! We attack their base! We just ignore their underlings and go straight for Tenkai himself! 
The magical force field over the capital must be his doing. So, if we strike at him… 
You're right, the force field would probably disappear! 
One decisive strike where the enemy is the most vulnerable. That's the same strategy as Karate! 
That seems to be the only viable strategy. 
Yaaaay! You're the smartest, Frère! 
Well, don't get too excited just yet. It certainly won't be easy to break through to their base… 
How about we strengthen Tokyo's defenses and get out all the civilians? 
But if Tenkai's magical force field is activated, it will probably destroy all of the capital. 
Not everyone will get out in time. To be blunt, that's not a good plan at all. 
…Damn it. We have to think of something better! 
But… Everyone… Everyone's going to die!? 
There's only one hour left… Once Tenkai's magical force field activates, the whole of Tokyo will be destroyed. 
Wait… Doesn't that mean we just have to do something about the force field itself? 
Yes! Ignore all the underlings and go straight for Tenkai. One decisive strike, just like in Karate! 
Hm, one hour might just be enough time to do that. 
…But how will we ever find out where Tenkai is? 
Leave that to me! At times like this, the steam processor comes in handy! 
It's hard to verify if it's Tenkai, but we can localize spiritual force and project it on a map of the capital. 
OK, do it! 
Yeah! Let's all gather in the Calculations Room! 
Hehehe… Seems like we don't have to step in, Ayame. 
Yes… He can stand on his own feet by now. 
Yeah, not soon, and he'll have reached his full potential. Not a bad look. 
It's been some time since we've been here. This machine is as awe-inspiring as ever. 
OK then! I'll have it show the spiritual force over the capital as dots on a map. 
That said, the steam processor can only detect location and strength of spiritual forces. 
…Which means, it can't determine which of them is Tenkai. 
But he'll probably be the biggest dot of the bunch. Let's take a look. 
All right. Here we go! 
Hmmm… 
Mon Frère… 
What is it, Iris? Did you feel something? 
I'm too small to see anything. Please take me on your shoulders! 
What!? Oh, well, OK! Better now, Iris? 
Yep! Thanks, Mon Frère! 
That brat! How can you be so shameless? 
Pffffffffft! 
Please, Sumire… 
Hmph! 
What do you think, Captain? That large dot sure looks suspicious… 
I think that's Tenkai. <br> I don't think it's Tenkai. 
That large power spike… That must be Tenkai, leader of the Hive of Darkness! 
Finally we've got him! Just you wait, Tenkai… 
Captain. The Thunderstrike and the Koubu are ready for deployment! 
Understood. 
I… I don't think that light is Tenkai. 
…Why? 
The other lights of the force field are organized in a systematic fashion. Only that one is different… 
Something's not right there… 
…No clue. Based on this, I really can't say. 
But whatever emits that strong spiritual force must be stopped. 
Time's running out. We have to go by gut feeling on this one. 
We can't go wrong if we take down the strongest of the bunch. It's just like brawling! 
I think so, too! 
Captain… I agree with everyone. 
Anyway, we don't have time to think about this any longer. Let's move out! 
You're right. OK! Let's assume that big light is Tenkai. 
Imperial Floral Assault Troupe, move out! Our target is Tenkai's base!

Hmph… So this is the Hexagram of Infernal Calling… 
Hahahahahaha! 
I am Tenkai, leader of the Hive of Darkness! Now, every living being in the Imperial capital has witnessed my awesome power! 
I'll use these powers to clean the capital of all filthy Western blood… 
In no time, the glorious Tokugawa shogunate will be restored! 
Miserable citizens of the capital! You have only one hour left to live! 
That means I'll grant the government time until 4 in the night to disband and bow down to me! 
As a sign of your submission, you'll hand over 10 billion from Teito Bank, and Lieutenant General Yoneda! 
If you don't meet my demands, the capital’s demise will be unavoidable! Waaahahahahaha! 
These demands are crazy… This is an outrage! We'll ignore him! 
We can't risk the lives of all the people in the capital! What's your decision, Prime Minister? 
One hour left… We can't give up hope. 
Count Hanakoji… Can't Lt. Gen. Yoneda's outfit help us? The Imperial Floral Assault Troop? 
Yes. I just contacted him. 
I think we should stop them… No, we MUST stop them! 
We can't allow this country to regress to a shogunate! 
He wants my life? Fine then! Tenkai! You can have it, but I'll take yours in return! 
Commander! 
Out of my way! After he's gone to so much trouble, I don't want to disappoint him!
