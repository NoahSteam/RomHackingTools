﻿It's a photo of Sakura. She's looking right at me. I wonder what she's thinking…
It's a photo of Sumire. This is a side of her you don't see too often.
It's a photo of Maria. …She's lost in thought and looks kind of sad…
A photo of Kanna. She looks strong and reliable. I can't wait to meet her.
A photo of Iris. She's surrounded by flowers and flashing a radiant smile.
A photo of Kohran. She's looking pretty in profile with her face dyed red by the evening sun.
A letter given to me by a customer. I was asked to give it to Sumire. I have a bad feeling about this…
Maria's pistol. This may help me escape from here…
A hair ornament. It's decorated with flowers and looks very elegant.
A pretty pendant. The delicate workmanship is gorgeous.
A hairpin for use in a traditional bun hairstyle. It would complement a formal outfit well.
This key will let me enter rooms I couldn't before.
I found this in a bedroom on the second floor. I can use it to access the back room.
A teacup Iris asked me to get for her. It has a very stylish design.
This is the matchbox Iris asked for. Its logo is quite colorful.
A knife Iris asked me to get for her. Just a normal utensil you'd use during a meal.
A prop sword and shield used onstage. They're well-made and look just like the real thing.
A prop crown used onstage. It's well constructed and incredibly detailed.
A wig and costume used onstage. I wonder what kind of act could use a flashy outfit like this?
A photo of Sakura in her swimsuit. Wow, this is really something. I'm gonna treasure this.
A photo of Sumire in her stage costume. Her distinctive makeup really makes an impact.
It's a photo of Maria on stage in the military uniform from "For Love"… She's a beautiful woman disguised as a man.
A photo of Kanna in her training gear. Catching her in a private moment like this feels surprisingly intimate.
A photo of Iris in her swimsuit. She's holding a rubber ring and looks ready to have some fun. How cute.
A photo of Kohran. I don't get to see her with her braids undone very often. It's a nice look.
A photo of Ayame in a traditional outfit. I hope she'll always be as happy and content as she is here.
Ayame's gun. Why…? Why did it have to turn out like this…?
Jean-Paul the teddy bear. Iris's best friend. She always carries him with her and takes good care of him.
All kinds of different books are lined up here. And in particular… 
Women's magazines and hair catalogs, huh? I guess this really is the theater archive. 
I wonder where Maria is? 
It seems like Maria isn't here. Where could she be? 
I wonder if Sakura's in there? 
There's no point in hanging around here. Let's go somewhere else. 
…No response. She's probably already asleep. 
Kohran must already be asleep. I would feel bad for waking her, so I'd better leave her alone. 
I wonder…if Kohran is in her room? 
I need to hurry and find Maria before the theater's lights go out for the night. 
…Guess she's not in here. Where could she have gone at this hour? 
…It's no good. I'd better go somewhere else. 
There's no way Iris could still be awake now, right? 
For now, talking with Maria is my first priority. Let's go. 
Zzzz… 
It seems like she's already asleep. 
Nobody's in here. You wouldn't expect anyone to be up drinking tea at this hour. 
But what Maria said earlier…that I'm "unfit to be captain"…Could that really be true? 
Looking out at Ginza at night, I never thought that the neon streets could be this beautiful. 
Right. I haven't spotted Maria. Where is she… 
Our performance of Cinderella was another success. Even the afternoon show had sold-out box seats. 
Let's try going somewhere else. 
In the afternoon, this is where the patrons with box seats gather. 
Maria…isn't here. Seems she's not on the terrace, either. 
It doesn't seem like this room has been used since I've been here. Feels like a bit of a waste… 
Maybe I'll check out somewhere else… 
The commander's office. 
Let's look for Maria. 
Commander Yoneda. It's Ogami. 
Snoooore… 
No good…he's out cold. 
And Yuri and Kasumi already went home… 
I'll try looking somewhere else… 
Maria…isn't here. 
No point in hanging around here. Let's go. 
This room is so lively when there's a performance, but becomes so quiet once the show’s over.
I guess I'll check out somewhere else. 
These props look incredible. I wonder who could've made them? 
The level of detail on these must really bring life to the stage. 
These props are great and all, but I'm worried about Maria. Where could she be… 
This set room must get used quite a bit, it's really dirty… 
Don't they clean it at all? 
But what Maria said earlier…that I'm "unfit to be captain"…Could that really be true? 
This galley kitchen is always in perfect order. I wonder who cleans it up. 
Well, maybe I'll go somewhere else. 
I'd like to have lunch with the patrons sometime. 
Maybe I'd get an idea of how they feel. 
Maria…isn't here. 
I wonder what sells the best in this shop. I bet it's the photos. 
You know, I haven't seen Maria. I wonder where she went. 
I'm always collecting tickets at that reception desk. *Sigh* It's hard work, all right… 
Maybe I'll head somewhere else. 
I wonder what my impression of this place was when I first came. I kind of want to remember now. 
Well, enough of that. I don't see Maria here. I wonder where she went… 
Since there are patrons here, that must mean there's peace and quiet in the capital, too, right? 
That's the way I always want things to be. So we have to keep trying! 
There's no one here. Let's head somewhere else. 
It seems like Sumire is back in her room, too. 
It doesn't look like Maria is here. Better try somewhere else. 
It seems like Sumire is back in her room, too. 
It doesn't look like Maria is here. Better try somewhere else. 
The basement storeroom. There are a bunch of things in here, as usual. 
Let's try somewhere else. 
The Training Room. Reminds me of military school… 
Let's try somewhere else. 
I can't believe they've got a pool down here. The Imperial Theater sure has some amazing facilities. 
Oh well. Better keep making the rounds. 
The Koubu are lined up. They're always ready to go in case of an attack from the Hive of Darkness. 
Although, it's always better when we don't need to use them. 
Maybe I should try somewhere else. 
There's no one here… 
I guess I'll go somewhere else. 
I've heard these showers use water heated by a steam machine in the Imperial Theater's basement. 
I guess I'll go somewhere else. 
It figures the Imperial Assault Troupe would have such advanced medical equipment. 
But I hope we won't be needing this room much. 
But what Maria said earlier…that I'm "unfit to be captain"…Could that really be true? 
There's no one here…Where in the world could Maria have gone? 
A steam-powered computer… 
I've heard there are only a few of this size in Japan. 
I guess I'll go somewhere else. 
This is the room where we have strategy meetings. No one's here… 
But what Maria said earlier…that I'm "unfit to be captain"…Could that really be true? 
Ugh…where am I? 
(Who is - ?!) 
What the - ! Ngh, I can't move…my arms and legs! 
W-what are you planning to do? 
W-what?! 
Stop! Kohran, stop! 
Stop! Please, Kohran, stop!! 
N-no, that's not the issue here… 
Stooop! Please, nooooo! 
…-mi… -gami… Ogami! 
How is he? 
Ugh… 
Thank goodness…he's awake. 
Ogami, are you all right? 
Y-yeah… 
…I guess it was a dream. 
Oh yeah… 
What happened to that kid? <br> What…happened to me? 
What… happened to me? 
You were quite gravely injured. 
I see… those Hive of Darkness bastards got me good… 
Chief… you were out for three days in one of the recovery pods. 
Ogami… are you in pain? 
(I suppose… my head aches a bit? But if that's the worst of it…) 
I'm just fine. <br> Only a little… 
Here, Mon Frère. Take your medicine. 
(Painkillers, maybe?) 
…… 
Eugh… what the heck is this?! I-it's so bitter! 
Kohran, are you certain this medicine will be effective? 
I figured something like this might happen, so I whipped up this wonder drug just in case. No need to worry. 
Y-you made this medicine, Kohran? 
H-huh? I suddenly…feel… 
Huh? Mon Frère? 
Hmhmhm, excellent. I see it's working beautifully. Your wounds will seal themselves up in no time at all. 
Of course, the tradeoff is that it'll knock you out like a light. 
Now, just clear your mind and drift off to dreamland. You did great, Chief… 
Okay everyone, let's give him about half a day to sleep it off. 
Awww, but whyyy?! 
C'mon Iris, you gotta be quiet now. 
But that's no fun! 
Sleep tight, Ogami… 
Sleep tight, Captain. Best to let Maria handle things for now. 
Huh? Where'd Maria get off to? 
Well… 
At any rate, let's take our leave. We wouldn't want to wake the Ensign. 
Right. Well then…goodnight, Ogami. 
It's nothing much. I'm just fine. 
I…I was soooo worried about you, Mon Frère! 
I'm sorry for worrying you, Iris… 
Still, what a relief it wasn't too serious! People are the one thing I can't fix. 
(Though you DID try to remodel me…) 
…Hm? 
What's up? You keep staring…there something on my face? 
No, it's nothing. 
Ogami, here. Take this medicine. 
Only a little… 
Oh no! Here, take this medicine right away. 
I think you're overreacting a bit, Sakura. 
Not necessarily. 
In that case, Chief, you really oughta get some rest. 
… 
… 
Mon Frère…does it hurt? 
You look like a wreck, all right. 
But it should be easy enough to power through injuries like these! 
Jeez! Mon Frère's not like you, Kanna! 
Ogami, please take this medicine! 
What happened…to that kid? 
He seems to have made it out safely. Apparently, his parents came by and couldn't stop thanking us. 
I see… 
Quite honestly…I am seeing you in a new light, Captain. 
Yeah, even if I worked myself up, there's no way I could've done what you did. I think I'm falling for you, boss. 
Yeah, you're amazing, Mon Frère! I love you too! 
Attaboy, Chief! Nice job! 
N-no… I really didn't… 
Ogami…are you all right? 
Mmm… 
(What the…) 
(Someone… is beside me…) 
(Ah… on my forehead, there's…) 
(…a cold hand… but, it feels…nice…) 
… 
(They left…) 
(That cold hand… who… could it have been?…) 
…Hm? Someone else is coming… 
Heya, Chief! Man, you sure look a mess. 
Eep! …Oh, it's you, Kohran… 
Aw, c'mon! I was just messing around. How you feeling? 
Thank you for the medicine. <br> I had a dream about you. <br> Could you let me sleep? 
Thank you for the medicine. It really helped me to relax. 
What's with the formality?! I'm gonna get all embarrassed if you keep thanking me like that! 
I came to check up on ya cause I was worried… 
…but at this rate, it's looking like you'll be in tip-top shape by tomorrow! 
Welp, I'm gonna head back. Take care, Chief! 
While I was out…I had a dream about you, Kohran. 
Eh? About ME?! 
Aww geez…how embarrassing. What kinda dream? 
I dreamed…I was about to undergo an operation where you would remodel me. 
What the heck!? …Is that the only kind of your dreams I show up in? 
Ahahaha! That's hilarious! 
…Chief. There's absolutely nothing I love better than fiddling around with machines. 
But… I think it's best not to fiddle around with people. 
People are perfect just the way they are! 
I see… 
Ahaha, listen to me sounding all high-and-mighty… sorry about that. 
Welp, take care. I'd better get going. 
Sorry…could you please let me sleep? 
Aw… and here I thought it'd be nice to talk for a bit. 
…Welp, I'll head back then. Take care. 
Chief… Guess you're still not doing so hot. 
Welp, take care… sorry to intrude. 
How are you feeling, Ensign? 
Sumire… 
Here, a get-well gift for you. It's a flower called a "hibiscus". 
Thank you. What a lovely flower. 
Hohohoh… I had them sent all the way from the south seas. 
Its vibrant red hue shines brightly amidst the gloom of the rainy season. 
Sumire, I had no idea you took an interest in the tropics. 
Oh, heavens no. Didn't you know, Ensign? The tropics are quite fashionable these days. 
Tropical plants, tropical clothing, tropical fruit…and tropical dance! 
Ah, that's right… Ensign. Next time, I will bring along a rare tropical fruit! 
…Thank you. 
It was my pleasure. Well then, I shall take my leave. 
Mon Frère, are you feeling any better? 
Iris… yeah, I feel a lot better. 
…I thought maybe you might not wake up again… 
I was so worried… 
…That makes me happy. <br> Sorry I worried you. <br> It was a nice break. 
…Thank you. That makes me happy, Iris. 
Hee hee! It really is you, Mon Frère! 
I don't know what I would've done if you had been a different person after you woke up! 
Okay, I'm gonna go back to my room now. Goodnight, Mon Frère. 
Iris… I'm sorry I worried you. 
It's okay! As long as you get better, I'll be happy! 
Once you get better, you have to play with me again! 
Of course. 
Okay, I'm gonna go back to my room now. Goodnight, Mon Frère. 
It was a nice break. I just got to sleep the whole time. 
…… 
Mon Frère, you…meanie! 
I-Iris?! 
I… I was so, SO worried about you! 
But you don't even care… you're awful! I HATE you, Mon Frère! 
Iris… you were worried about me? I feel awful… 
Mon Frère… are you feeling sick? 
Rest up and get better, okay? 
Goodnight, Mon Frère. 
How are you feeling, Ogami? 
Sakura… 
Ogami… are you hungry? I brought you something to eat. 
Yeah, thank you. 
Thank goodness, you're looking better. 
Ahh… seems as though everyone's been so concerned for me. 
Oh, don't you worry about that. 
What happened the other day… I would've done the same thing in your position. 
Sakura… 
No… maybe I couldn't have done it, after all. 
I thought… you were incredibly brave back then. 
Even though you got hurt saving that boy, you were all right in the end. 
So things really worked out for the best… I'm sure of it. Besides… 
Besides…what? 
Besides… it's given me so many more opportunities to talk with you… 
It's all because of your bravery… 
Sakura… 
…Well, take care. I'd better be going. 
Yo, boss. You feeling a little better? 
Kanna… you always sound so energetic. 
Yeah! People are at their best when they're energetic. 
A smiling face is the next best thing! Then food… and so on, y'know? 
Hahaha… that sounds exactly like you, Kanna. 
…I wish I could have half of your energy. 
Hey now! That weak-kneed attitude isn't gonna fly, boss. 
You sure as hell weren't that feeble when you risked your life to save that kid. 
Kanna… 
Now, I've got guts to spare…more than just about anyone. 
But when the moment came, you were the one who put your life on the line without a second thought… just you, boss. 
Honestly… I'm kinda frustrated with myself. 
…… 
But it made me think, "Now THAT'S a real man!"… 
Heheh…it's frustrating, but I feel sorta good about it, too. Man, I'm a weirdo. 
Kanna… 
…A-anyway, that's why you better get back on your feet soon, boss. 
…Later! 
Kanna… 
…I've certainly caused everyone a great deal of worry… 
… 
Crap…my head…is… 
Ug…gh… 
Ensign… 
Oh, Maria… what's the matter? 
I-it's nothing… I was just passing by… 
I see… thanks. 
No… I really should apologize for barging in on you. 
Sorry about this… I'm the captain, and yet I still let something like this happen to me… 
… 
Why…did you leap out like that…? 
…huh? 
I'm asking you… why did you leap out back then?! 
Well… that kid was… 
…Sir. Please allow me to speak freely just this once! 
The wounds you received in that battle… are entirely your own fault! 
Not only that, but the enemy slipped past us because you let yourself be distracted by a single civilian… 
As a result, far more civilian lives were put in danger… do you understand that? 
You're wrong! <br> …You're absolutely right. 
If you get swept up by emotions and lose sight of the big picture, you won't be an effective leader. 
Ensign Ogami. You are… unfit to be captain! 
…! 
That is all I have to say. Excuse me! 
…… 
Was I… 
…mistaken? 
…Maria has a point, too. <br> I can't be wrong! 
At any rate, I should try to speak with Maria about this again. 
Maria… certainly has a point. 
If I had abandoned that child back there… we would've undoubtedly defeated the enemy. 
But that child's life… would have been lost. 
No, that's not true! If I'd abandoned that child back then… 
…I would've spent the rest of my life regretting it. 
…You're wrong! 
There's just… there's no way I could stand by and let that child be killed! 
We in the Imperial Assault Troupe are duty-bound to protect the citizens of the capital! 
If we can't even save one child, then what good is the Troupe?! What good is the Flower Division?! 
You don't get it, do you, Ensign?! 
That short-sighted line of thinking is what led to this outcome! 
It is nonsensical for the Flower Division's captain to risk his life for a lone citizen! 
Maria! You've gone too far! 
…Very well, let's assume for a moment that you had died while saving that child. 
Ensign… at that point, could you truly say that you'd fulfilled your duty as Captain of the Flower Division? 
Maria… what you say makes sense from the perspective of a warrior or a soldier. 
But abandoning a child… is something I could never do! 
… 
If… you had died… 
…it would have been no different from… back then. 
…? 
I certainly failed by letting the enemy escape… 
And we can't exactly say that we drove off the Hive of Darkness… 
You aren't looking at the big picture, here! 
If you had been killed while rescuing a lone citizen… 
What would become of the capital? Who would battle the Hive of Darkness?! 
Well… 
You didn't think that far ahead, did you? 
…… 
If… you had died… 
…it would have been no different from… back then. 
…Maria? 
Well… 
The actions you took trying to save just one citizen… are what led to this state of affairs! 
If you had been killed while rescuing a lone citizen… 
What would become of the capital? Who would battle the Hive of Darkness?! 
Well… 
You didn't think that far ahead, did you? 
…… 
If… you had died… 
…it would have been no different from… back then. 
…Maria? 
…Hm? I can hear people talking. 
What the hell is wrong with you? Maria, this isn't like you at all. 
…… 
Wasn't saving the kid the obvious thing to do in that situation? What's got you all riled up? 
This has nothing to do with you. 
Just what's that supposed to mean?! 
We've known each other forever… What do you stand to gain by hiding things from me? 
Am I really that unworthy of your trust?! 
That isn't the issue here. 
You always do this. No matter what… you refuse to trust anyone! 
C'mon, talk to me… or I'm gonna start throwing stuff! 
…I'm sorry, Kanna. It really is nothing. 
… 
We finally have a chance to talk, and… I'm sorry. 
I hate it when you're like this. 
…… 
You'd better snap out of this soon, or I'm gonna stop talkin' to ya forever. 
Kanna… 
(Ack, Kanna's leaving!) 
Hide! 
I gotta get out of here! 
Huff, huff… Looks like I managed to get away without them seeing me… 
Ugh… crap… my head… 
Running…like that…was a bad idea… 
B-boss?! 
K-Kanna… 
You… were eavesdropping! 
N-no, well… 
I misjudged you. I never figured you'd do such a thing. 
Kanna… 
Ugh… crap. What a time… for my head to start pounding… 
I feel faint… I can't… 
I'm… 
… 
Well, Ogami. As of tomorrow, you're out of here! 
Meet the new captain. 
Starting today, I'm the captain. So we don't need you anymore, Mon Frère. 
Ogami, I'm so disappointed in you. 
Starting tomorrow, you'll become a servant of the Kanzaki household! 
To think, I expected so much more from you. 
We better get started on those remodels soon. 
You're unfit to be captain. 
You are unfit to be captain. 
You're useless! 
Let's remodel him! 
You're unfit to be captain! 
Everyone… everyone… 
Sir… 
You are… 
You are… 
Tears… Maria is… crying? 
Why are you… 
…Maria! 
…huh?! 
What? This is… 
Ogami? 
Ayame… 
Stay with me, Ogami. 
This is… 
You collapsed in the library, Ogami. You don't remember? 
You collapsed in front of Maria's room. You don't remember? 
I couldn't carry you to the infirmary on my own. Since it's getting late, I brought you here for the time being. 
…How do you feel? Are you still unwell? 
You were groaning so much, and yet all I could do was give you some medicine… 
I see… 
I'm so sorry. I've been nothing but a burden to you ever since we first met… 
Haha, it's all right… after all, part of my job is to look after the well-being of you and the rest of the Division. 
…Although, I suppose it is in my nature to worry over other people. 
I have been looking after others for a long time now… 
(That sounds like her, all right…) 
Oh… By the way, ma'am, why did you come here to the theater? 
I was transferred to the Ginza headquarters. This is where I will be stationed from here on. 
But is anything bothering you, Ogami? …you seemed to be in such agony. 
…… 
If you'd like… you can confide in me. 
Am I… unfit to be captain? <br> I'm… worried about Maria. <br> No… it's nothing. 
Am I… unfit to be captain? 
…What? 
To tell the truth, Maria told me that I'm "unfit to be captain!" earlier. 
I… I can't help but wonder… did I do the right thing? 
…… 
Yes, there is certainly truth in what Maria said. 
…! 
If you were to fall in battle, who would protect the capital? 
You must take care not to act rashly. 
…Understood. 
However, no one can truly know what is right. 
If you were to ask for my opinion, Ogami… you mustn't waver! 
What's important is that, no matter what end it may lead you to… 
…you should strive to live without regrets. 
…… 
Now, all that's left is for you to try and have a good talk with Maria, as her captain. 
Yes, ma'am! 
Haha… very good. Well then, off you go. 
I'm… worried about Maria. She hasn't been herself lately. 
…… 
I see… 
Maria isn't one to speak openly about her own troubles. 
Ogami… a captain's duties do not end with leading his forces into battle. 
If you are concerned about Maria, you should make every effort to understand what she is going through. 
You have nothing to lose by trying, right? 
Yes… that's true. 
Haha… very good. Well then, off you go. 
No… it's nothing. 
…Really? Is it something you can't speak to me about? 
No… it's not like that… 
Ogami, by keeping your feelings locked away inside you… you're doing the very same thing as Maria. 
M-ma'am, how did you… 
Haha… I did say that looking after people is in my nature, didn't I? 
The only thing I can do for you right now is to care for your injuries… 
…but Maria may be in need of YOUR help. Don't give up. 
…Understood. 
Haha… very good. Well then, off you go. 
…It's something you can't tell me, then. 
…I'm sorry. 
It's all right. We all have worries we must overcome to grow stronger. 
But… it's important to accept guidance from others in times of trouble, too. 
I will always be by the Flower Division's side, watching over each one of you… 
Don't forget that, all right? 
…Understood. 
Haha… very good. Well then, off you go. 
Looks like Kohran already left. 
…I shouldn't be wasting time with this. I'd better hurry and find Maria. 
Ah, Chief. What're you doing up at this hour? 
What about you, Kohran? Weren't you nodding off in here earlier? 
…Huh? How'd you know about that? 
…It's crazy embarrassing you saw me like that! Hahaha, ohh man. 
You were saying something about an "airplane" in your sleep… 
Wha-? I was talking about that?! 
Yeah… though, I didn't mean to listen in… 
…I getcha. Eh, it was just sleep-talk, so don't worry about it. 
Welp, I'm gonna head back to my room and get to bed for real. See ya later, Chief. 
…Well, I'd better get going too. I need to find Maria and speak with her. 
Hey… is that Kohran asleep over there? 
(That's Kohran, all right. Why is she asleep in a place like this?) 
Carry Kohran to her room. <br> Speak to her. <br> Leave quietly. 
Mmm… 
Kohran? 
Wait up… I… the airplane… 
(…She's talking in her sleep? Wonder what sort of dream she's having.) 
(I should leave her here. I'd hate to wake her.) 
(I should leave her here. I'd hate to wake her.) 
Mmm… 
Kohran? 
Wait up… I… the airplane… 
(…She's talking in her sleep? Wonder what sort of dream she's having.) 
(At any rate, I'd better get going. Finding Maria is my top priority right now.) 
Hey, Kohran. You'll catch a cold sleeping here like this. 
Uhnn… mm… 
Kohran. 
Didja happen to… make a… new airplane? 
…Airplane? Kohran… still half-asleep, I see. 
…Eh?! Chief?! 
C-Chief, it's you! Sorry 'bout that! I wasn't fully awake! 
Hey, it's okay. More importantly, you'll catch a cold sleeping out here. 
So sorry! Thanks a bundle for waking me up; you're a lifesaver! 
Welp, I'm gonna head back to my room and get to bed for real. See ya later, Chief. 
…Well, I'd better get going too. I need to find Maria and speak with her. 
Oh well. I'd better carry her to her room. 
…Huh? 
Kohran… I'm gonna pick you up now. 
Up we go… 
…Huh? She's… lighter than I expected. 
…… 
She may be a member of the Flower Division, riding the Koubu into battle… 
…but she's still just an ordinary girl. 
Right then… where should I take her? 
Take Kohran to her room. <br> Take her to my room. 
Okay, let's get Kohran to her room. It's pretty close by. 
Kohran. We're at your room. Hey, Kohran, wake up. 
Uhnn… mm… 
Agh, Chief?! W-why am I here? 
H-huh? This… isn't the library. It's the door to my room. 
I found you asleep in the library, so I carried you here. 
I figured you might catch cold otherwise… 
Is that right? Thanks, Ogami! I owe you one. 
I got so sleepy right in the middle of my research… 
Go ahead and turn in for the day. Don't push yourself too hard. 
You got it… welp, good night Chief. 
Yeah, good night. 
Good night, Kohran. 
Well then… It's getting late. I need to hurry and find Maria. 
Well, I'll take her to my room for now. 
O-Ogami! And… Kohran! 
Eep! S-Sakura… 
Um…are you feeling better? 
Yes. I'm a bit thirsty, so I got up to get some water. Um, by the way… 
…Ogami. Where were you taking Kohran? 
U-uh, well, I just… 
So she's asleep… all right. I'll take her to her room. 
B-but… 
"But" nothing! Leaving her with you would just cause me to worry! 
Come on now, Kohran. Let's go. 
Mmhmm… 
Well then, please excuse us, Ogami. 
Oh boy… she really caught me with my pants down there. 
…I'd better pull myself together and find Maria. 
This is bad… what should I do? 
Oh, Ogami! And Kohran, too… What's the matter? 
Oh, Sakura… 
Um… are you feeling better? 
Yes. I was asleep for so long that I'm not tired at all anymore, so I went to go borrow a book. 
But never mind that…What are you doing, Ogami? 
The thing is, Kohran dozed off in the library… 
I figured she might catch a cold if I left her like that, so I'm carrying her to her room. 
Oh, so that's all it was. I thought for sure that… 
For sure that… what? 
N-no, forget about it. 
Well then, I'll bring Kohran to her room from here. It's pretty close by. 
And this way I can take her inside, since we're both women. 
I see… all right, I'll leave her to you. 
Sure thing. Hey… Kohran. Let's go. 
Uhnn… mm… 
Haha, such a sleepyhead… Well, please excuse me, Ogami. 
…I need to get back to looking for Maria. That was quite a detour. 
Oh, Sumire. What are you doing up so late? 
I misplaced my stage shoes, so I came back to fetch them. 
(Oh… I should ask her if she's seen Maria.) 
Um, Sumire… 
Ah, that's right! Ensign, I've a favor to ask of you. 
W-what is it? 
Since you're already here, would you mind terribly giving my shoulders a rub? 
It is vitally important to relax before bedtime in order to stay beautiful. 
B-but I'm kind of in the middle of something right - 
Do you mean to say… you won't abide my request? 
A-all right… 
(Oh man… how did I get stuck doing this when I need to be looking for Maria?) 
Ahh, this feels wonderful… 
Ask about Maria. <br> Get on her good side. 
Say, Sumire. Since I'm rubbing your shoulders, would you mind if I asked you something? 
…Oh my. Ah - a little to the right… Well, what would you like to ask? 
Have you seen Maria? I've been searching for her. 
Maria, you say? Very well, give me another 100 rubs and I shall answer you. 
S-seriously? Well, okay then. I'll give this massage my all! 
Ahh… just like that, Ensign… how… wonderful… 
Thank you so very much, Ensign. I shall sleep quite well thanks to this. 
I will take my leave of you. Please excuse me. 
H-hey, Sumire! You promised me you'd tell me where Maria went! 
Oh my, I must have forgotten. It was about Maria, wasn't it? 
Maria… I have not seen her even once since night fell. 
Wh-what the heck?! Sumire, you don't know where she is? That wasn't the deal! 
Goodness. While I said I would answer you, I never said that I knew where she was. 
A plea of ignorance is still an answer. With that, excuse me. 
…I fell for that hook, line, and sinker. 
Oh man…I can't believe I let myself get fooled by Sumire of all people… 
Why ma'am, you're terribly stiff here. 
Ahh… just like that, Ensign… how… wonderful… 
Ensign, you certainly are skilled at giving shoulder rubs… quite the captain, indeed. 
(How does giving shoulder rubs make me "quite the captain"?) 
Oh… a bit more at the base of my neck, if you please… 
Certainly, ma'am. Right around here? 
Why yes, right there. Ahh, how wonderful… very well, next is… 
(Just how long is she planning to have me do this?) 
Aghh… my fingers have given out… 
Thank you so very much, Ensign. I shall sleep quite well thanks to this. 
I will take my leave of you. Please excuse me. 
…Oh man. What a complete waste of time. 
I've gotta find Maria… better try somewhere else. 
Ahh, what a heavenly feeling… having a gentleman rub my shoulders is rather exhilarating. 
(I'd say that rubbing the shoulders of a woman like her is pretty exhilarating…) 
Oh… a bit more at the base of my neck, if you please… 
Certainly, ma'am. Right around here? 
Why yes, right there. Ahh, how wonderful… very well, next is… 
(Just how long is she planning to have me do this?) 
Aghh… my fingers have given out… 
Thank you so very much, Ensign. I shall sleep quite well thanks to this. 
I will take my leave of you. Please excuse me. 
…Oh man. What a complete waste of time. 
I've gotta find Maria… better try somewhere else. 
I wonder if Sumire is in her room? 
I've gotta get going. Right now, finding Maria is my top priority. 
…No response. Maybe she's asleep? 
It's Ogami… 
I have retired for the evening. If there is something you need of me, could it wait until tomorrow? 
S-sorry. 
It's Ogami… Sumire, are you there? 
Oh, Ensign. Was there something you needed? 
It's just… have you seen Maria around? 
No, I cannot say that I have. 
I see… sorry to bother you so late. 
I wonder if Ayame is in her room? 
For now, talking with Maria is my first priority. 
Um…… It's Ogami…… 
…Ogami. Hurry now, and find Maria. 
…understood. 
Um…… It's Ogami…… 
Ogami? Come in, it's open. 
…Pardon me. 
Ma'am, there's something I wanted to ask you about… 
…About Maria, yes? 
…Yes. 
Maria isn't one to speak openly about her own troubles. 
Ogami… a captain's duties do not end with leading his forces into battle. 
If you are concerned about Maria, you should make every effort to understand what she is going through. 
You have nothing to lose by trying, right? 
Yes… that's true. 
Haha… very good. Well then, off you go. 
Maybe Maria is in her room? 
I'd better look somewhere else. At any rate, I need to have a proper discussion with Maria… 
It's Ogami… Maria, are you there? 
…… 
You there, Maria? 
…… 
Looks like she's not in her room… where could she be? 
Ahem! It's me… 
…Guess she's not here, after all. 
This will be Kanna's room from today on. 
No point in loafing around here. I'll try somewhere else. 
…Not here, I guess. 
Kanna…are you there? 
Snoooore… 
Already asleep, then… 
Kanna left, so there's no one here now. 
…Oh well. I'd better go, too. 
Yo, Boss. I'm feelin' a bit more clear-headed after my shower. 
I-I see. I bet you're feeling great. 
How about you clear your head too? You'll sleep like a baby afterwards. 
Y-yeah, you're right. 
BossI know I boiled over and shouted at you earlier, but… 
Please, I need your help with Maria. She seriously never opens herself up to anyone. 
But, you're her captain. She just might open up to you. 
So enough with the sneaky eavesdropping. You need to get right up in her face and talk to her. 
Kanna… 
Later, Boss. I'm heading out now. 
…Get right up in her face, huh? 
…I better find Maria. I've wasted enough time already. 
Hey… I can hear the shower going… and this locker is open. 
…! 
…K-Kanna's clothes are in the locker… which means…! 
C-crap… blood is rushing to my head… make good choices, Ogami! 
I'm outta here! <br> I'm moving to the shower… 
Going into the shower right now would be crossing the line. I'm outta here! 
Phew… I managed to get myself under control… 
C-crap… I can't decide what to do! 
…Whew, all freshened up. Time to get outta here. 
I'm dead! I need to get out of here! 
Phew… I managed to escape before she noticed. 
No… my body… it's moving on its own… toward the shower… 
(K-Kanna's in the shower…) 
…Hm? 
Who's there… is that you, Boss? 
(Ack! S-she found me out already!) 
W-what should I do?! 
Run away. <br> Act natural. 
(C-crap! I've gotta get out of here!) 
Huff, huff… Phew, I'm out of breath… 
Oh boy… I was nearly in hot water there… 
Don't you mean I was the one in hot water?! 
Eep?! K-Kanna, you knew I was there?! 
'Course I did! And I find voyeurs completely disgusting! 
First eavesdropping, now this… just what kind of man are you?! 
I'm… I'm sorry. 
Peeping on someone just tryin' to wash off her training sweat… 
So much for my nice, refreshing shower! 
Augh… Kanna sure tore into me there… 
I'm… pretty ashamed of myself. 
(So it's come to this… here goes nothing!) 
Y-yeah, it's me, Kanna. I came to take a shower too. 
Oh, all right then. There's some open stalls toward the back, so hop on in. 
(Yes! She bought it!) 
Hey, Boss…,you still wearing your clothes? Are you gonna shower like that? 
O-oh man, you're right! Ha, hahaha… How silly of me! 
Hahaha, better screw your head back on! 
W-well, I'd better go… take it easy Kanna. 
Whew… what a miracle. She actually believed me… 
…That was a huge waste of time. I better hurry and find Maria… 
Did you come to take a shower? There's some open stalls toward the back. 
Y-yeah… 
(Huh… she didn't freak out! She doesn't care that I'm here?) 
Hey, Boss…you still wearing your clothes? Are you gonna shower like that? 
O-oh man, you're right! Ha, hahaha… How silly of me! 
Hahaha, better screw your head back on! 
W-well, I'd better go… take it easy, Kanna. 
Phew… oh man, it's a good thing that was Kanna in there… 
…That was a huge waste of time. I better hurry and find Maria… 
Ensign… 
Maria, wait up! 
Ensign… Leave me alone! 
Maria, please listen to me! 
Maria! I know I shouldn't have eavesdropped, but please listen to me! 
I don't… have anything to say to you! 
Maria! Wait! 
Fwahahahaha! 
…! 
…That voice! 
…! 
…Soldier of the revolution? Cassowary? What the heck's he talking about? 
…He's gone. 
… 
Maria… 
What…was that about? <br> "Cassowary"…? 
What…was that about? 
…He's that Hive of Darkness member we fought in Tsukiji. I believe his name was "Setsuna"… 
He called you "Cassowary" a minute ago… 
What sort of name is that? 
… 
… 
Ensign… let's head back inside. 
Maria… if you go, then I'm going with you. 
…It's all right. Did you really believe I would rise to such a provocation, Ensign? 
Well then… excuse me. 
All the same… all that just now… 
"Cassowary" and "soldier of the Russian Revolution"… what could it all mean? 
Maria… you really aren't going to tell me anything, are you?

So you've come around? 
Heheheh… 
Heheheh, you have fallen into our clutches at last, Ichiro Ogami. With this, the Troupe's end is at hand. 
Heheh, well then, Ogami. Let me introduce you to my brilliant assistant. 
Heya, Chief! Man, you sure look a mess. 
Heheheh… How does it feel? Knowing you're about to be remodeled by your former subordinate? 
By our hand, you will be reconstructed as the Hive of Darkness's newest minion! 
Now, Kohran! Pour every ounce of your skills into the creation of our new comrade: the New Ichiro Ogami! 
Right-o, leave it to me!

Maria Tachibana! Member of the Imperial Assault Troupe, soldier of the Russian Revolution… 
Or perhaps, I should call you "Cassowary"?! 
The Hive of Darkness has seen through to your true identity! 
Your position as a soldier who defends justice is but a mere facade… in truth, you are a stone-hearted savage! 
Tch…! 
If you don't wish your past exposed for all your comrades to see, you will show yourself before us immediately! 
Hmhm…hahahahaha!

Oh boy, this is great! I've been dying to take a shot at modifying a human body! 
No worries! All of my experiments on animals so far have been successful! 
Alrighty. This won't hurt a bit, so you just quit that wriggling and leave everything to me!
