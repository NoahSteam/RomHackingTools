It's a photo of Sakura. Her gaze is so intense. I wonder what she's thinking?
It's a photo of Sumire. It shows a side of her that's usually hidden.
It's a photo of Maria. She's lost in thought and seems a bit sad...
It's a photo of Kanna. She looks energetic and confident. I can't wait to meet her.
It's a photo of Iris. In it, she's one beautiful flower surrounded by many.
It's a photo of Kohran. She looks good in her traditional outfit. What kind of person is she?
A customer gave me this letter and asked me to pass it on to Sumire... Hmm.
It's Maria's gun. I wonder if I can use it to escape?
It's a cute flower-shaped hairpin.
A pretty pendant. The delicate workmanship is gorgeous.
A hairpin that looks best with traditional Japanese clothing and hairstyles.
This key will let me enter rooms I couldn't before.
I found this in a bedroom on the second floor. I can use it to access the back room.
This is the cup Iris asked for. It's a cute little thing.
This is the matchbox Iris asked for. Its logo is quite colorful.
This is the knife Iris asked for. It's just an ordinary piece of silverware.
It's a prop sword and shield used in stage plays. Looks handmade.
It's an exquisitely-detailed prop crown used in stage plays.
It's a gaudy costume wig. What play could it possibly be used in?
A photo of Sakura in a swimsuit? Whoa, this is pretty risque... I can't let anyone else see it.
It's a photo of Sumire in costume. Her elaborate makeup is quite impressive.
It's a photo of Maria on stage in the military uniform from "For Love"... She's a beautiful woman disguised as a man. 
It's a rare training photo with a very private feel.
A photo of Iris in a swimsuit. She looks so cute holding that inner tube.
It's Kohran in a maid outfit. She looks great with her hair down.
It's Ayame in Japanese-style clothing. I wish she'd smile like that all the time.
It's Ayame's gun. What am I supposed to do with it?
It's Jean-Paul, Iris's beloved teddy bear.
Phew ...The play's about to start. I'm ready to punch some tickets.
I still can't believe they put me to work punching tickets...
Hello, Ensign. You're doing a wonderful job.
Hi, Sumire. What's up?
A new member will be joining us today.
I came to check on things before the play begins. However, it seems she hasn't arrived yet.
What's her name? <br> What's she like? <br> Is she cute?
What's her name?
Kohran Li. Everyone just calls her "Kohran," though.
Kohran Li...?
Yes. She was born in China but speaks with a Kansai accent.
I see...
Ah, look at the time! I'm needed onstage. Please excuse me.
Oh? What's she like?
She speaks with an unusual Kansai accent, and apparently she has a knack for tinkering with machines.
She was transferred to the Hanayashiki Branch upon her arrival here.
Hanayashiki Branch?
Yes. It is a branch of the Imperial Combat Revue in Asakusa that operates as an amusement park.
I see...
Ah, look at the time! I'm needed onstage. Please excuse me.
Oh? Is she cute?
You can decide that for yourself! Now, if you'll excuse me...
W-wait, Sumire! ...Was it something I said?
You seem out of sorts, Ensign. Are you unwell?
S-sorry! I was just lost in thought.
Oh? What were you thinking about?
The new member <br> Punching tickets <br> Tonight's dinner
Um, I was thinking about the new member...
I take it you're worried about how she will mesh with the rest of the team.
You're beginning to think like a captain, Ensign Ogami.
Hahaha! Thanks.
Ah, look at the time! I'm needed onstage. Please excuse me.
I was thinking about how much I hate punching tickets...
While I don't disagree with you, Ensign,
I am far too busy to discuss such trivial matters! Please excuse me.
...Guess I shouldn't have said that.
I was thinking about what to have for dinner tonight...
What?! How dare you waste my time with such nonsense!
You are utterly infuriating! Goodbye!!
Yikes! That didn't go well...
...Ensign? You're staring into space. Are you all right?
S-sorry! I was just lost in thought.
Lost in thought? That simply will not do.
As Captain of the Flower Division, you must always stay alert.
S-sorry...
Now then, I am needed onstage. Please excuse me.
So I guess we're getting a new member.
Apparently she's been here before. I wonder what she's like?
Uncle Ichi!
Hey, Iris. What's up?
Um, I came to meet Kohran!
Who's that? <br> What about the play?
Kohran? Who's that?
Oh, she's a member of the Flower Division!
She spent a little time here before.
A member of the Flower Division, huh?
Yeah! One time, she was showing off this weird gizmo she built...
when suddenly it went KABOOM!
Kaboom?
Yeah! She got totally covered in ash!
Yikes! She sounds bonkers...
Oh no! The play's starting! I've gotta go!
Bye bye, Uncle Ichi!
What about the play, Iris? It's almost curtain-up time.
Oh, you're right! I hope Kohran gets here soon!
You can't keep waiting like this. Get a move on or Maria will fuss at you.
Right! I don't wanna make Maria mad again!
Bye bye, Uncle Ichi!
...You okay, Uncle Ichi? You seem kinda spaced out.
S-sorry! I was just lost in thought.
Huh? You mean talking to me is boring?!
No, of course not...
Hmph! Bye, Uncle Ichi!
Oops... I made her angry.
So I guess we're getting a new member.
Her name's Kohran. I wonder what she's like...?
W-whoa! What was that racket?!
Y-yes...
U-um...
Are you OK? What's with that mess of a bike?
...Are you OK? Oh, and just who are you, anyway?
What's with that mess of a bike...?
I-I see...
I'm sorry.
Er...
I'm Imperial Japanese Navy Ensign Ichiro Ogami.
You could say I'm the captain-in-training of the Imperial Combat Revue.
I'll be happy to escort you. <br> I'm rather busy right now...
I'll be happy to escort you. This way, please.
Oh, what about your bike...?
I'm rather busy right now, so I can't escort you.
S-she's gone...!
Ogami!
Tsubaki...
You mustn't let Kohran run off by herself! She's sure to get lost.
I'll handle punching tickets. Please go with Kohran.
...Okay. Sounds good to me.
W-wait!
...She's gone.
Ogami!
Tsubaki...
You mustn't let Kohran run off by herself! She's sure to get lost.
I'll handle punching tickets. Please go with Kohran.
...Okay. Sounds good to me.
Come forth, Four Lords of Death...!
We are gathered here before you...
How may we be of service?
What was the meaning of that debacle, you imbeciles?!
Well, a mysterious group called the Imperial Combat Revue thwarted our plans...
I do not want excuses!
Our apologies, Master Tenkai...
The fact is they are quite skilled...
Silence, Satan! We are supposed to be invincible!
I've devised a way to destroy the barrier around Teito! ...A spell called the "Hexagram of Infernal Summoning."
Complete this spell and destroy the capital! Your first target shall be Shiba Park!
Yes, master!
Wait! This time I shall come along. I'm sure you would like to watch me fight.
Don't you agree, Satan?
Yes, master...
Hmph! Your days are numbered, you old fool...
Eeeeeek!!
*Cough cough* Um, this is the Imperial Theater, right?
*Cough* Geez Louise... My Steam Bike's trashed...
The name's Kohran Li. I've been transferred here from the Hanayashiki Branch.
Yoneda! Yoneda, where are you?!
No sweat! I'll go by myself!
Huh?! Are you blind or what?!
This Steam Bike is my very own invention! It's got a 16v engine and can do 200 kph at 100 hp!
Does that sound like a mess to you?! Keep talkin' crap about my bike
and I'll knock your block off!
It's all good! I'm Kohran Li, scientific genius.
I'll be living here from now on. Nice to meetcha!
Anyways, who are you?
Oh, so you're our boss...
Kohran Li reporting for duty, sir! I recently transferred here from the Hanayashiki Branch, sir!
Please direct me to Lieutenant General Yoneda, sir!
Much obliged, Ensign Ogami...
No sweat! I'll find him myself!
Are you a Koubu pilot, too?
They're complex machines, and typically only girls have the spiritual energy to pilot them.
It's rare to see a guy pilot one. You must be a real hot shot!
By the way, the Hive of Darkness is made up of remnants of the Tokugawa regime who wanna overthrow the government.
We've got to stop them.
Come in!
Welcome to the Gift Shop! How can I help you?
How do you do? I'm Tsubaki Takamura. It's a pleasure to meet you, Ogami!
Hello, Ogami! How can I help you?
I hope I was able to be of service. Thank you very much for coming by!
Andre, my love! Please...run away with me.
Were I to abandon my duty and men to run away with you... I would be a different man.
Would you still love me then?
Oh, Andre!
Grrrr! Arrrrgh!
Hello there. You're Ogami, right? I'm Yuri Sakakibara!
I do the theater's office work. I'm looking forward to working with you!
Oh my, have you come to visit me? Hee hee! Just kidding.
What can I assist you with?
I hope I was able to be of service.
It's nice to meet you, Ogami. I'm Kasumi Fujii.
I'm the theater's office manager.
Do you need something?
Good work today.
Look, it's still swollen. Let me lick it again.
Come on, don't be embarrassed!
How does that feel?
Doing your best is all well and good, but take care of yourself, okay?
Well, well! Looks like you were having lots of fun!
You two look just like lovers, how nice.
I see... Well then...
Oh dear! Are you okay?
Yes, but you're bleeding! Let me take a look.
What a pretty girl... I wonder who she is? ...*Sigh*
Ogling girls? You should be ashamed of yourself.
How rude! Since when did I become your wife?!
You're the worst!
What a pretty girl... I wonder who she is? ...*Sigh*
Ogling girls? You should be ashamed of yourself.
How rude! Since when did I become your wife?!
You're the worst!
Well done.
This is the Deputy Commander of the Imperial Combat Revue, and chief of the Hanayashiki Branch.
I'm Ayame Fujieda. Pleased to meet you, Ogami.
A captain must be able to make judgments in an instant. I have high hopes for you. Good luck.
*Sigh*
Cursed Imperial Combat Revue! They are defiant to the bitter end!
No matter. We shall show them how fearsome I, Tenkai, truly am.
Lords of Death!!
Destroy the capital!! Annihilate the Imperial Combat Revue!!
Annihilate! Annihilate! Annihilate!
How does that feel?
Doing your best is all well and good, but take care of yourself, okay?
No worries! I always carry a repair kit with me just in case!
I'll have it fixed in a jiffy!
By the way, Ensign. You went up against the Hive of Darkness, right?
How'd it feel?
Heh! You've got guts! I like that.
Don't get too cocky, though. We don't know what'll happen next.
Really? I appreciate your honesty, Ensign. Most people couldn't admit that.
And now that I'm here, you've got nothing to worry about! I'll protect you!
Er, you don't have to talk about it if you don't want to.
After all, everybody's gone through stuff they'd rather forget!
Say no more, say no more.
Just give it all you've got next time, Ensign!
I-is that my photo?! Gee, how embarrassing!
Um, Ensign? I want to go to the Manager's Office...
I'll be on this stage very soon...
Are you sure about this, Ensign?
A captain must be able to make judgments in an instant. I have high hopes for you. Do your best, Ogami.
Do your best, Ogami.
EEEEEEK!!
E-ensign!!
Welcome to the Gift Shop! How can I help you?
