Victory pose… Yeah!

Leave it to me!!
Watch this, Ogami.
I'm fine, I can still fight…
Thank you!
Keep it up, Ogami!
I knew I could count on you!
Kyaaa!
Ngh, I'll show you next time!
I'm sorry… Ogami…
It's my turn in the spotlight.
Hahaha!
I'm off!!
Today's performance is all for you!
It'll take more than that to bring me down…
Ensign, so you really do care for me…
Come, Ensign, it's your move!
I'll be watching you!
Uwahhh!!
I suppose I'll let you win for now!
The captain needs me!!
I'll have to take down the enemies myself!
Where's my next target!?
Whoever wants to die first, just step forward…
I'll be relying on your orders, sir!
I'm not finished yet!! Not yet!!
You would go that far… for my sake…
Focus, sir!
We'll make it out of this alive, sir!
Ahhh!!
They're too strong!! I need to withdraw!!
Forgive me, sir. I need to withdraw!
I can fight too!
Here I go!
I'm super strong!
I'll fight hard for Mon Frère!!
Uh, some of these lights are flashing…
You're the best, Mon Frère!
Go get 'em Mon Frère!

Stupid… stars…

Better not underestimate science~!
Movin' out!!

Take 'em down, Chief!
Uwahhh…
Dangit… they got me…
Sorry Chief…
All right! Let's do this!!
Full power! Hiyaaaaa!
Feast your eyes on the killer techniques of the Kirishima!
Let's take 'em down, Boss!!
No problem! It's just a scratch!!
Thanks! I owe you one!
Get in there, Boss!
Let's see what you can do!
Uwahhh…
Damn. Guess I still haven't trained enough…
I've gotta keep fighting… for the boss.
Gwahahahaha!! Burn! Burn it to the ground! Reduce this entire world to ashes!!
The Imperial Assault Troupe has arrived!
So you've come… the reckless fools who defy Lord Satan! Show me what you're made of!
Gweheheheh… I am Inoshishi, the Boar! Fall before me, and burn in the fires of Hell!
Gugyaahhhh!!
Lord Satan! Forgive meeeee!! Gwaaaahhhh!!…
All right!
We did it!
We did it!
Phew!
Nice one!
Woo! We did it!!
Stop right there!
Wow, it's so easy to move around in! We can win this, I'm sure of it!
I did it! This all the result of my special training and the new power of the Jinbu!
Ohohoho! Did you really believe you could get the better of me?
What incredible performance… Without that special training, I'd never be able to control the Jinbu this well.
Hee hee! Looks like I've gotten waaaay stronger!
Wooooooaaah! That's some power, all right! My special training really paid off.
So, how'd ya like the power of my brilliant Jinbu?! Better run while ya still can!
Sakura and Sumire's Special Attacks are deadly against groups. Bait enemies into a good position to use them.
You must see through Boar's patterns of attack in order to defeat him!
What on earth was that?! He's on a whole other level than the other enemies! Ogami, please be careful!
Th-That was quite an attack! But don't think that such a cheap trick will work more than once!
Such a powerful attack… But his actions are all one-note. You should be able to see through them, Captain.
Ooooh, I hate this guy! Hurry up and beat him, Mon Frère!
Whoa, that's some attack! Boss, maybe we oughta hang back and see what this guy's made of first?
Yikes, that's one doozy of an attack! Chief, maybe it'd be a good idea to take a wait-and-see approach here?
Gwahahaha! Impressive, eh?! My flames will consume everything! So, had enough yet?
We're done for! <br>This is nothing.
We're done for! He's too strong! That's the Kouma for you!
You'd better believe it! Gwahahaha!
Nicely done, Ogami. Boar has let down his guard, so his defenses have lowered!
This is nothing. Is this the best the Kouma have to offer?
Ngahhhhhh! You bastard! I'll make mincemeat of you!!
This is bad! His anger is fueling his power, and it's increasing fast! He'll probably aim for you, Ogami!
What? Too scared to open your mouth?! Gwahahahaha!!
Nicely done, Ogami. Boar has let down his guard, so his defenses have lowered!
Sakura trusts you from the depths of her heart. Try attacking with her when you have enough Willpower.
Sumire trusts you from the depths of her heart. Try attacking with her when you have enough Willpower.
Maria trusts you from the depths of her heart. Try attacking with her when you have enough Willpower.
Iris trusts you from the depths of her heart. Try attacking with her when you have enough Willpower.
Kanna trusts you from the depths of her heart. Try attacking with her when you have enough Willpower.
Kohran trusts you from the depths of her heart. Try attacking with her when you have enough Willpower.
I think everyone will be fine without my protection.
I will protect you, Sakura!
I'll always be there to protect you, Sumire.
Let me watch your back for you, Maria.
I'll always be there for you, Iris.
Don't worry, Kohran! I'll protect you!
Kanna! I've got your back!
