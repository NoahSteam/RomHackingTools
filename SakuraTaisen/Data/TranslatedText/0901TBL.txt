It's a photo of Sakura. She's looking right at me. I wonder what she's thinking…
It's a photo of Sumire. This is a side of her you don't see too often.
It's a photo of Maria. …She's lost in thought and looks kind of sad…
A photo of Kanna. Kanna's signature strength comes through clearly.
A photo of Iris. She's surrounded by flowers and flashing a radiant smile.
A photo of Kohran. She's looking pretty in profile with her face dyed red by the evening sun.
A letter given to me by a patron. I was asked to give it to Sumire. I have a bad feeling about this…
Maria's pistol. This may help me escape from here…
A hair ornament. It's decorated with flowers and looks very elegant.
A brooch. It's a beautiful piece of delicate craftsmanship.
A hairpin for use in a traditional bun hairstyle. It would complement a formal outfit well.
Jean-Paul the teddy bear. Iris's best friend. She always carries him with her and takes good care of him.
This key will let me enter rooms I couldn't before.
I found this in a bedroom on the second floor. I can use it to access the back room.
A teacup Iris asked me to get for her. It has a very stylish design.
This is the matchbox Iris asked for. Its logo is quite colorful.
A knife Iris asked me to get for her. Just a normal utensil you'd use during a meal.
A prop sword and shield used onstage. They're well-made and look just like the real thing.
A prop crown used onstage. It's well-constructed and incredibly detailed.
A wig and costume used onstage. I wonder what kind of act could use a flashy outfit like this?
A photo of Sakura in her swimsuit. Wow, this is really something. I'm gonna treasure this.
A photo of Sumire in her stage costume. Her distinctive makeup really makes an impact.
It's a photo of Maria on stage in the military uniform from "For Love"… She's a beautiful woman disguised as a man.
A photo of Kanna in her training gear. Catching her in a private moment like this feels surprisingly intimate.
A photo of Iris in her swimsuit. She's holding a rubber ring and looks ready to have some fun. How cute.
A photo of Kohran. I don't get to see her with her braids undone very often. It's a nice look.
A photo of Ayame in a traditional outfit. I hope she'll always be as happy and content as she is here.
Ayame's gun. Why…? Why did it have to turn out like this…?
What am I supposed to do down here?
You'll know soon enough...
Th-this…
Yes, that's our enemy… the Koma.
Koma…
They are much more formidable foes than the Black Web.
Yes…
Since the cat is out of the bag now, there's something I have to tell you.
Take a look at this…
Why are there Koma on a picture as old as this!?
This is the oldest one we know of right now.
The war against the Koma didn't just start now.
Four hundred years ago, a big conflict between man and Koma took place right on this land.
Back then, we won. We struggled but managed to seal them away deep beneath the ground.
But even while hidden from us, the Koma continued to plot their return to the surface.
A few times during those four hundred years, they broke the magic barrier and carried out small attacks.
But each time, the humans fought back and managed to chase them back underground.
There were people before us who fought the Koma?
Since ancient times…
The Imperial Anti-Demon Unit was put together for precisely that reason.
We're talking long ago… No one seriously considered demons a threat to Teito back then.
Sakura's father, Kazuma Jinguji, and myself gathered allies in secret.
For us, the demons' presence was all too real.
B-but… Even though you didn't have Spirit Armors, you managed to fight them?
Of course, back then we couldn't dream of fighting the demons on a level playing field, like we can now.
We had to rely on the strength of our arms and the blades of our swords…
By the time the Koma Wars were over, we had lost both Kazuma Jinguji and Shinnosuke Kanzaki.
That was six years ago…
Kazuma Jinguji possessed an unparalleled spirit force… the "Power of Purification".
But Kazuma Jinguji didn't die in vain… He sealed the Koma.
The Power of Purification?
I think I told you before, but the Power of Purification is a power owned by the Demon Hunters since ancient times.
But only a small number of bloodlines remain… the Jinguji family is one of them.
The Jinguji bloodline…
…So Sakura should have the same power?
Yes… But unleashing that power requires knowledge of ancient secrets.
Perhaps Colonel Jinguji was planning to teach them to Sakura once she'd come of age.
That means together with Jinguji, we have also lost our means to fight back against the Koma…
But one last trump card remains…
A trump card…?
Yes! One last desperate measure. I'm talking about… this!
Th-this is…!
These are what we call the Pandemonium Insignia.
Pande-what?
As you can see, the Pandemonium Insignia are ancient ritual items comprised of Sword, Jewel and Mirror.
If someone with a pure heart holds them, they can suppress the power of the demons. They're super effective!
…!?
But they may only be used in exceptional circumstances. That's very important!
Sir…?
No, it's nothing…
…The Pandemonium Insignia are something like amplifiers. If their wielder has an evil heart, that evil will be amplified.
Now that the force field holding the Koma has been opened by the Six Star Summoning of the Black Web…
The Pandemonium Vessel is the only thing keeping them from breaking out onto the surface.
The Pandemonium Vessel is our last resort.
Our… last resort?
But listen, Ogami… The Pandemonium Insignia are at the same time our biggest threat.
If they were to fall into the wrong hands…
…Then the Koma would come to the surface with their powers strengthened manifold!
But why is such a valuable item with the Imperial Theater? And here in this storage room, of all places?
Our Ginza headquarters stands on the capital's most concentrated vein of spirit energy.
Spirit energy is the life force powering nature and everything that lives… It is the energy of human spirits.
And right on this place of power, we sing and dance. All the while protecting an ancient ritual item…
…
What's this?
Sacred what?
As their name indicates, the Pandemonium Insignia contain the the powers of all Demons and Gods, of good and evil.
I didn't tell you before, but our true mission is to protect the Pandemonium Vessel from those with sinister ambitions.
…!?
As long as the key to unsealing the Sacred Demon Castle is in our hands, they will surely try to take it from us.
Ogami… The Koma will come here sooner or later.
That's why you and Ayame have to ensure the Vessel's safety at all costs.
Yes!
This is a top-secret mission, so you mustn't tell anyone. Not even your own squad mates!
Sakura… Does she know how her father died?
No… he didn't tell me. Ogami, can you say it?
You're saying the monster we're fighting now is the same one that killed Kazuma?!
It is too heavy a burden for a young woman of 18 years. If she knew…
Sakura, she…
Don't tell Sakura any of this… Are we clear on that?
Of course…
…Are we?
Got it!
Ouch…
It may seem fun at first, but comedy's hard work, too.
Let the commander bring you some medicine.
That's the thing. Mr. Ogami isn't here.
He isn't here? Why?
Uncle Ichi? I saw him and auntie Ayame go downstairs a while ago.
…with Ayame?
Downstairs?
What are they doing there?
That looks suspicious.
Ogami…

Commander…
If we place a trap here, the enemy won't reach the underground storage room even if they invade the theater.
…A trap? But what kind of trap?
Let's have a bucket of water fall on their heads!<br>nLet's spray them with steam!<br>nLet's dig a pitfall!
Let's see… How about having a bucket of water fall on their heads? That'd be funny!
…
…I'm sorry.
Hihihi…
Ha… hahaha…
Hihihi… You're funny, Ogami.
Phew… (That wasn't supposed to be a joke…)
Hihihi… I like that about you. You're always so easygoing…
Wha…?
In our fights against the demons, we face death on a daily basis. It's kill or be killed…
Thanks to that, I… I guess I may have forgotten what it means to be human.
Ma'am…
Even though I'm a woman, I had delusions of grandeur and became deputy commander. Maybe that's why?
Not at all! I… I like that about you!
I admire you as a human being.
Hihi… Thanks. Please don't ever change, Ogami.
Er, y-yes.
We could reroute a steam pipe from the storage room and set it up to spray them.
I see. That's good thinking.
Right? It would be best to use the auxiliary pipe that runs to the top.
The piping here is ideal for that…
How about a pitfall?
A pitfall?!
That's a tried and trusted method since the dawn of time.
But Ogami, how exactly do you intend to dig a hole into the floor of the theater?
…Well…
It's a nice idea, but the walls and floor are made of Silucius steel…
Without some heavy machinery, you can't even scratch it.
Silucius what?
It's the same alloy used for the armor of the Koubu and Jinbu.
Hm, so it wouldn't work…
Hmmm…
I can't think of anything right now…
Sorry…
No need to apologize, Ogami. It was me who put you on the spot like that.
By the way… The storage room has a pretty strong spiritual protection, doesn't it?
Yes, exactly. Only a pretty powerful Koma could break through here.
But we have to take any measures we can, so we're ready no matter what happens.
…I suppose.
Oh, you've… you've got oil on your face.
No, please… I'll wipe it off myself!
Oh, don't be childish! You have to take better care of your appearance from now on.
(She always smells so nice…)
Remember when we first met? How I did the same for you then?
…Ah, you're right. Sakura was mad at me after that.
Hihi…
Ahahaha.
It's priceless to have friends who you can trust.
It's a shame we often only notice that after losing someone…
…Ma'am?
…There! You're presentable again, Ogami.
Th-thank you, ma'am!
You're welcome. You're always so honest and direct.
Y-yeah…?
It's important to always be true to yourself.
I… I'm not sure if I'm really…
Lately… I feel like I'm not myself…
Ms. Ayame…?
Please continue to stay true to yourself.
What? No… Don't make me blush…
Hmm… What else…
That's good, that way you can quickly change your mood.
Huh…?
In our fights against the demons, we face death on a daily basis.
Because of that, I… I guess I may have forgotten what it means to be human.
Ma'am…
Even though I'm a woman, I had delusions of grandeur and became deputy commander. Maybe that's why?
Not at all! I… I like that about you!
I admire you as a human being.
Hihi… Thanks. Please don't ever change, Ogami.
Er, y-yes.
…What are you lot conspiring about?
…………!
The look on his face… it's like he's melting away with passion.
He's head over heels!
She's out of your league, boss!
Uncle Ichi looks sooo awkward when he's blushing!
Ogami…

Mr. Ogami… Those flushed cheeks don't become you.

That man… Aoi Satan… Maybe his true goal is the Pandemonium Insignia.
The Pandemonium Insignia are the key to the gates of the Sacred Demon Castle.
They're in our possession right now.
No one except me and Ayame can open this vault.
That's why we can expect him to attack us! So be ready!
It's a castle that was built hundreds of years ago to bring death and destruction to the world.
We can't allow it to appear on the face of the earth!
Even among the military, this is highly classified information. Don't talk to anyone about it.
The treasure is almost in our grasp!
Be careful, this place is riddled with traps! Take each step exactly like I'll show you!
Yes, OK.
First three steps to the left, then four to the right and seven straight ahead…
…Is a path you absolutely shouldn't take.

W-what the heck?!
Aah…aaah!!
Guaaah! T-that's…
Seima Castle…
Behold! Here lies Yamato, the phantom realm that was erased from history!
You are too late to thwart my ambitions. I am the true ruler! Satan, Lord of Heaven!
Degeneration, anger, despair! Come to me now…
