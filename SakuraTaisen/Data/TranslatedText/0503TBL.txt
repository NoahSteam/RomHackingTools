It's a photo of Sakura. She's looking right at me. I wonder what she's thinking…
It's a photo of Sumire. This is a side of her you don't see too often.
It's a photo of Maria. She's lost in thought and looks kind of sad…
A photo of Kanna. Her signature strength comes through clearly.
A photo of Iris. She's surrounded by flowers and flashing a radiant smile.
A photo of Kohran. She's looking pretty in profile with her face dyed red by the evening sun.
A letter given to me by a customer. I was asked to give it to Sumire. I have a bad feeling about this…
Maria's pistol. This may help me escape from here…
A hair ornament. It's decorated with flowers and looks very elegant.
A pretty pendant. The delicate workmanship is gorgeous.
A hairpin for use in a traditional bun hairstyle. It would complement a formal outfit well.
This key will let me enter rooms I couldn't before.
I found this in a bedroom on the second floor. I can use it to access the back room.
A set of cups Iris asked me to get for her. They have a very stylish design.
This is the matchbox Iris asked for. Its logo is quite colorful.
Some knives Iris asked me to get for her. Just a normal utensil you'd use during a meal.
A prop sword and shield used onstage. They're well-made and look just like the real thing.
A prop crown used onstage. It's well constructed and incredibly detailed.
A wig and costume used onstage. I wonder what kind of act could use a flashy outfit like this?
A photo of Sakura in her swimsuit. Wow, this is really something. I'm gonna treasure this.
A photo of Sumire in her stage costume. Her distinctive makeup really makes an impact.
It's a photo of Maria on stage in the military uniform from "For Love"… She's a beautiful woman disguised as a man.
A photo of Kanna in her training gear. Catching her in a private moment like this feels surprisingly intimate.
A photo of Iris in her swimsuit. She's holding a rubber ring and looks ready to have some fun. How cute.
A photo of Kohran. I don't get to see her with her braids undone very often. It's a nice look.
A photo of Ayame in a traditional outfit. I hope she'll always be as happy and content as she is here.
Ayame's gun. Why…? Why did it have to turn out like this…?
Jean-Paul the teddy bear. Iris's best friend. She always carries him with her and takes good care of him.
…Phew. It was a tough battle this time. 
But… Sumire and Kanna, you both fought well. 
All right, you've both made up, right? Everyone lived happily ever after. 
Ahh… What have I done to deserve this? My stomach is killing me. 
Th-Thank you. It seems Sakura drove it off, but… 
Oooh… My stomach. Oooooooh… Won't somebody help me?

Sumire… 
What is it…? 
You… Somehow, you did it. 
You too! Well, you didn't do quite as much as I did but… 
Pft… Watch it, ya airhead!

This is bad! I’ve gotta help out! Yikes! 
Are you OK, Boss? 
He would be just splendid if you left him be! In any case, I must provide him with some tender, loving care.
Like you could take care of anyone!
I could turn your words right back at you! 
Imagine, being treated by such a beast… Hohoho, the very thought is sickening. 
What's your problem!? 
What, pray tell, is your problem!?

Anyway, Sumire… weren't you bitten by a spider? 
Ah!! I had completely forgotten! We must q-quickly get back and treat this or else the v-venom will…! 
Wait… speaking of… weren't you bitten by a snake, Kanna? 
Huh? Ahhhh~!! I totally forgot! T-This is no good! Snake's venom! 
Leave this to me! It just so happens that I brought along a poison detector! 
Why does Kohran always conveniently carry these kinds of things…? 
I just need to hold the detector up to the wound and… wait for the results. 
Both of you are lookin' fine! Ain't no snake venom, no spider venom, no reaction at all! 
Just as I thought! Oh ho ho. As if I, Sumire Kanzaki, would be done in by a spider. Not a chance! 
Dammit Sumire! If you really knew that then why were you freaking out so much?! 
Ahh~, it seems we're back to the usual Sumire and Kanna. 
Not much to be done about it, huh? But it appears they're fighting like good friends, if I do say so myself. 
It should be pretty easy to see why they get along, honestly. 
They both despise the Hive of Darkness, that's enough, right?
