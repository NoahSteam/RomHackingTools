﻿I've got to focus!
Here I go!
Leave it to me!!
Watch this, Ogami.
I'm fine, I can still fight…
Thank you!
Keep it up, Ogami!
I knew I could count on you!
Kyaaa!
Ngh, I'll show you next time!
I'm sorry… Ogami…
It's my turn in the spotlight.
Hahaha!
I'm off!!
Today's performance is all for you!
It'll take more than that to bring me down…
Ensign, so you really do care for me…
Come, Ensign, it's your move!
I'll be watching you!
Uwahhh!!
I suppose I'll let you win for now!
The captain needs me!!
I'll have to take down the enemies myself!
Where's my next target!?
Whoever wants to die first, just step forward…
I'll be relying on your orders, sir!
I'm not finished yet!! Not yet!!
You would go that far… for my sake…
Focus, sir!
We'll make it out of this alive, sir!
Ahhh!!
They're too strong!! I need to withdraw!!
Forgive me, sir. I need to withdraw!
I can fight too!
Here I go!
I'm super strong!
I'll fight hard for Mon Frère!!
Uh, some of these lights are flashing…
You're the best, Mon Frère!
Go get 'em Mon Frère!
I'll be watching!
Kyaaaa!!
Stupid… stars…
Sorry, Mon Frère…
Gonna go all out.
Better not underestimate science~!
Movin' out!!
Check this out!
I'm takin' too much damage here!
Aww, you're the best!
I'm rootin' for ya!
Take 'em down, Chief!
Uwahhh…
Dangit… they got me…
Sorry Chief…
All right! Let's do this!!
Full power! Hiyaaaaa!
Feast your eyes on the killer techniques of the Kirishima!
Let's take 'em down, Boss!!
No problem! It's just a scratch!!
Thanks! I owe you one!
Get in there, Boss!
Let's see what you can do!
Uwahhh…
Damn. Guess I still haven't trained enough…
I've gotta keep fighting… for the Boss.
All right!
We did it!
We did it!
Phew!
Nice one!
Woo! We did it!!
The Imperial Assault Troupe has arrived!
These are different from the enemies you've fought until now! Be careful!
Wh-What?! There's something wrong with my Koubu!
Everyone, eject! The Koubu… they've hit their limit!
Roger!
Ogami, these enemies seem a lot stronger than the ones we've always faced before!
Ensign, our previous enemies don’t hold a candle to these beasts!
Sir, these are formidable foes!
Man, these guys can really put up a fight!
Mon Frère, I'm scared!
These monsters really aren't messin' around, Chief!
(Their strength is on a completely different level than ours… What do we do?!)
Damn, they're so powerful!
Ogami, we can't keep this up!
Ensign, this isn't looking good…
Captain! As things stand, there's no way we can win! Do you have any strategies in mind?
This is bad, Boss! We're gonna get destroyed at this rate!
This isn't good, Mon Frère! We're losing!
This is bad, Chief! Our Koubu can't take much more of this!
Ensign Ogami, the Soaring Whale is preparing to bombard the area. You must take shelter past the shrine gate!
Ogami! We can't launch our attack until all units have evacuated! Get a move on!
Roger that! All units, evacuate through the shrine gate!
Ma'am, all units have been evacuated! Please commence bombardment!
Nicely done, Ensign Ogami!
Soaring Whale, prepare for bombardment! Targets sighted! And, fire!
Bombardment completed. The enemies are still alive, but they should have been greatly weakened.
Ensign Ogami, the time for victory is at hand. Annihilate the enemy!
OK! The battle is won. All units return to base.
…?! Ogami, my Koubu… it won't move!
…?! Ensign, my Koubu isn't moving!
…?! Sir, my Koubu won't move!
…?! Boss, my Koubu's not moving!
Huh?! Mon Frère! My Koubu won't move.
…
These enemies are much stronger than anything you've faced before! Ogami, don't stretch yourself too far.
Don't recklessly attack. Focus on defending yourselves and evacuate to the other side of the shrine gate.
Even if you're able to deal some damage, it won't affect the enemy's considerable strength. Do not act rashly.
Bahahaha! For a bunch of worms, you've got an awful lot of spirit!
I am Boar, of the Three Knights of Twilight! We shall meet again… that is, if you fools can survive this!
I am Deer, of the Three Knights of Twilight. Even if you survive this, you will have to face me!
I am Butterfly, of the Three Knights of Twilight. The lot of you should feel fortunate to have even met me.
Hohohoho. Be sure to give thanks to your god for our encounter before you die.
I'm afraid I won't be dirtying my hands this time, either.
But I imagine these fellows will offer you more than enough hospitality in my absence. If you'll excuse me…
Sakura trusts you from the depths of her heart. Try attacking with her when you have enough Willpower.
Sumire trusts you from the depths of her heart. Try attacking with her when you have enough Willpower.
Maria trusts you from the depths of her heart. Try attacking with her when you have enough Willpower.
Iris trusts you from the depths of her heart. Try attacking with her when you have enough Willpower.
Kanna trusts you from the depths of her heart. Try attacking with her when you have enough Willpower.
Kohran trusts you from the depths of her heart. Try attacking with her when you have enough Willpower.
I think everyone will be fine without my protection.
I will protect you, Sakura!
I'll always be there to protect you, Sumire.
Let me watch your back for you, Maria.
I'll always be there for you, Iris.
Don't worry, Kohran! I'll protect you!
Kanna! I've got your back!
