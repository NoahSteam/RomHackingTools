……Phew. It was tough this time, eh? 
But… Sumire often fought with Kanna. 
Alright, you've both made up, right? Everyone lived happily ever after. 
Ahh… What have I done to deserve this? My stomach is killing me. 
Ahh, thank you. It seems Sakura blew me off but… 
Oooh… My stomach….Oooooooh… Won't somebody help me?

Sumire…… 
What is it….? 
You…. Somehow, you did it. 
You too~! Well, you didn't do quite as much as I did but… 
Ah~! Watch what you say, dummy!

No good! I require assistance! Aaah~! 
Are you OK, Captain? 
I will be just splendid if you'd leave it alone! Outside of our present situation, I must make preparations for the Second Lieutenant. 
Why can't you just get over yourself?! 
I could turn your words right back at you! 
To be treated like such a despicable woman. Ho ho ho. You make me sick. 
What's your problem!? 
What, pray tell, is your problem!?

Anyway, Sumire…Weren't you bitten by a spider? 
Ah!! I had completely forgotten about that! We must q-quickly get back and treat this or else the s-s-s-spiders venom will…! 
Wait… speaking of…weren't you bitten by a snake, Kanna? 
Huh? Ahhhh~!! I totally forgot! T-this is no good! Snake's venom! 
Leave this to me! It just so happens that I brought along a poison detector! 
Why does Kohran always conveniently carry these kinds of things…? 
I just need to hold the detector up to the wound and… wait for the results. 
Both of you are lookin' fine! Ain't no snake venom, no spider venom, no reaction at all! 
Just as I thought! Oh-ho-ho. As if I, Kanzaki Sumire, would be done in by a spider. Not a chance! 
Damnit Sumire! If you really knew that then why were you freaking out so much?! 
Ahh~, It seems we're back to the usual Sumire and Kanna. 
Not much to be done about it, huh? But it appears they're fighting like good friends, if I do say so myself. 
It should be pretty easy to see why they get along, honestly. 
They both despise the Hive of Darkness, that's enough, right?
