What's up, Kohran?
This pattern bugs me. I'll check it out, so y'all go on ahead.
No worries! I'll catch up with y'all in no time.
And if things get hairy, my Jinbu has a little secret weapon installed…
Huh…? What are you talking about?
Well, wouldn't be a secret anymore if I told ya. Just leave it to me!
…All right. But don't do anything stupid.
Roger, Chief!
This pattern, that's magic… Could it be…?
That damn Satan, this is what he used to revive the Three Knight and their Acalas!
Well, not anymore! Right? Kanna, Sumire…
Well, not anymore! Right? Sakura, Sumire…
Well, not anymore! Right? Kanna, Sakura…
Your show's over! In show business, ya gotta know when to leave the stage!
Wow, this thingamajig sure is sturdy…
Whoops, what was that? Is this thing booby-trapped?
Get ready, little Jinbu. We gotta use our little special something…
You can do this without me.
Sakura… I'll protect you, I swear!
Sumire… I'll always protect you!
Maria… I've got your back.
I'll always protect you, Iris!
I'll protect you, Kohran! Don't you worry!
Kanna! Leave the defense to me!
What's the matter, Sakura?
This pattern is strange. I'll have a look. Please go on ahead.
Don't worry. I'm sure this won't take any time at all.
…All right! But make sure to come after us as soon as possible, Sakura.
Roger!
This pattern… is it magic?
So that's what they used to revive the Three Knights and their Acalas!
But I won't let that happen again! Kanna, Sumire…
Your show is now over!
Wow, this thing is sturdy!
Oh no! It was a trap!
This is necromancy!
Wh-What is this power?!
There's no time… Let's move, Captain.
…You're right!
