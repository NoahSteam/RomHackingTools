It's a photo of Sakura. She's looking right at me. I wonder what she's thinking… 
It's a photo of Sumire. This is a side of her you don't see too often. 
It's a photo of Maria. …She's lost in thought and looks kind of sad… 
It's a photo of Kanna. She looks strong and reliable. I can't wait to meet her. 
It's a photo of Iris. She's surrounded by flowers and flashing a radiant smile. 
It's a photo of Kohran. She looks good in her traditional outfit. What kind of person is she? 
A letter given to me by a customer. I was asked to give it to Sumire. I have a bad feeling about this… 
Maria's pistol. This may help me escape from here… 
A hair ornament. It's decorated with flowers and looks very elegant. 
A brooch. It's a beautiful piece of delicate craftsmanship. 
A hairpin for use in a traditional bun hairstyle. It would complement a formal outfit well. 
Jean-Paul the teddy bear. Iris's best friend. She always carries him with her and takes good care of him. 
This key will allow me to enter rooms I couldn't get into before. 
I found this in a bedroom on the second floor. Now I can get into the room at the back. 
A teacup Iris asked me to get for her. It has a very stylish design. 
A matchbox Iris asked me to get for her. The brand logo is very colorful. 
A knife Iris asked me to get for her. Just a normal utensil you'd use during a meal. 
A prop sword and shield used onstage. They're well made and look just like the real thing. 
A prop crown used onstage. It's well constructed and incredibly detailed. 
A wig and costume used onstage. I wonder what kind of act could use a flashy outfit like this? 
It's a photo of Sakura in her swimsuit. Wow, this is really something. I'm gonna treasure this. 
It's a photo of Sumire in her stage costume. Her distinctive makeup really makes an impact. 
It's a photo of Maria during a performance of "All For Love." Even in a man's uniform, her beauty shines through. 
It's a photo of Kanna in her training gear. Catching her in a private moment like this feels surprisingly intimate. 
It's a photo of Iris in her swimsuit. She's holding a rubber ring and looks ready to have some fun. How cute. 
It's a photo of Kohran. I don't get to see her with her braids undone very often. It's a nice look. 
It's a photo of Ayame in a traditional outfit. I hope she'll always be as happy and carefree as she is here. 
Ayame's gun. Why…? Why did it have to turn out like this…?
Nothing I can do here. I'd better check somewhere else…
There's no one here. I'd better check somewhere else…
I'd better check somewhere else…
I'm not making any progress here. Maybe I should go to the manager's office and talk to Lt. Gen. Yoneda.
The more I wander around this place, the more it seems like a normal theater…
Imperial Navy Ensign Ichiro Ogami:
As part of a special mission, you are hereby ordered to take up a new post as captain of the following brigade:
'The Imperial Assault Troop', Anti-Demon Interception Squad, Flower Division.'
Furthermore, your mission is a highly-classified one for the sake of the defense of the capital.
You are to head to Ueno Park to join up with the troupe. 
Imperial Army Lieutenant General. <br> <sp> <sp> <sp> <sp> <sp> <sp> <sp> ~Yoneda Ikki
…Ichiro Ogami.  As of today, you will be transferring to the Imperial Assault Troop, Flower Division.
Yes, sir!  Ichiro Ogami, prepared to work to the utmost limits of my abilities, sir!
Yes…  Excellent reply.
A politician such as myself can not discuss the military secrets of the Assault Troop with you here.
For further detail, ask Lieutenant General Yoneda. He is the commanding officer of the Imperial Assault Troop.
Now then, head for Ueno Park.  I expect you to live up to the expectations I had when I recommended you as captain.
Understood, sir!  Ichiro Ogami, now proceeding to Ueno Park!
The sanctity of the capital rests in your hands.  Do your best.
Yes, sir!
Ah, what nice weather!  And the Ueno cherry blossoms are in full bloom.
Now then… Where do you suppose the meeting place is…? I guess I'll try walking around a bit more.
That reminds me…  I believe Ueno Park was where that monster disturbance happened just a while ago…
Apparently, the one who cut down that monster in a single blow was a young girl…
… 
He said someone from the Imperial Assault Troop would come to meet me; when do you suppose they'll show up?
What's this?  That girl…
…!  She's coming this way…
Y-yes.  I happen to be Ogami…
Um…  Forgive me, but, who might you be?
…From Lieutenant General Yoneda?
(I'd heard someone would be coming to meet me… but I never would have expected it to be a woman…)
Um, excuse me… would you happen to be from the Imperial Assault Troop!?
Ah…  I'm Imperial Navy Ensign Ichiro Ogami.
Still… to think a young woman like yourself would be a member of the squad…  Frankly, I'm a little surprised.
Ah, n-no…  It's not that…
(…I suppose only in a covert squad would it not be unusual to find female squad members like her…)
Eh? Theater… you say!?
I'm on duty! <br> First tell me more about you.
I'm on duty! Sorry, but I don't have time to see a play right now.
Ehh!?  The base of a covert squad is inside a theater!?  That can't be…  No, wait a second…
In order to conceal oneself from the enemy's eyes, first do so from one's allies.  I see.
First, I'd like to know more about you.
I see… that's an excellent attitude. I'm relieved to hear those words. That's how a secret corps member should be.
…That would mean the Imperial Assault Troop has something like a secret weapon, wouldn't it?
(Koubu?  Ahh… the name of the secret weapon.  I wonder what sort of thing it is.)
Y-yes!  If you would, please.
(Why do I need to go to a theater…?)
(Is she really… a member of the Imperial Assault Troop?)
O-oh, no!  It-it's nothing!
(It couldn't be… I'm overthinking this.  This girl knew my name, didn't she?)
Ye-yes!  If you would, please.
The Imperial Theater that was built last year… Never would've expected it to be in the middle of Ginza…
It's a big building…
Surely, no one would notice that the headquarters of a covert squad is inside a theater like this…
Wow…  What an impressive entryway.  Still, it seems a bit careless not to have a lookout posted…
Still… it's rather quiet, isn't it.
(Performing at night? …Does she mean nighttime drills?)
Huh!?
(Wh… who is this kid!?)
Ah… I'm… Imperial Navy Ensign, Ichiro Ogami.
(A child like this… is a member of a covert squad?)
J…just what was that girl all about?
Sakura's left, too…  That's no good.
There's nothing I can do about it.  I guess I'll just go see Lieutenant General Yoneda myself…
…Who could that be?  It sounded like a voice just came from the dining hall…
(Wah!  …Wh-what a bold outfit!)
…My-myself, you mean!?
Ye- yes, ma'am…
Why should I have to do that? <br> Yes, right away!
Why should I have to do such a thing…?  I refuse!
In the first place, that's no way to make a request of someone!
…I happen to be Imperial Navy Ensign Ichiro Ogami, transferred as of today to the Imperial Assault Troop.
You can say 'fired' all you like, but without a decree from the Navy's General Headquarters, I cannot leave.
……!
…It's Ogami. Um, where might Lieutenant General Yoneda be?
Through this way? Thank you very much.
Yes, right away! …Here, there you go.
(Huh…?)
…I happen to be Imperial Navy Ensign Ichiro Ogami, transferred as of today to the Imperial Floral Assault Group.
I wish to personally convey the message to Lieutenant General Yoneda…
……!
Waah! Wh-what are you doing all of a sudden!?!
Um, excuse me… Wh-where might Lieutenant General Yoneda be!?
…It's Ogami.
Y-yes, ma'am…
Why should I have to do such a thing…? I refuse!
In the first place, that's no way to make a request of someone!
(Huh?)
(That's all well and good for her to say all of a sudden, but… just who is this woman!?)
I happen to be Imperial Navy Ensign Ichiro Ogami, transferred as of today to the Imperial Floral Assault Group.
You can say 'fired' all you like, but without a decree from the Navy's General Headquarters, I cannot leave.
……!
…Hello, I'm Ogami. Um, where might Lieutenant General Yoneda be?
Through this way? Thank you very much.
…So this is the office of the head secretary of the Imperial Assault Troop, his Excellency, Lieutenant General Yoneda…
Lieutenant General Yoneda… An active strategist in the Russo-Japanese War… What sort of a person is he?
Ah… Forgive me. I'm Imperial Navy Ensign, Ichiro Ogami.
I would like to see his Excellency, Lieutenant General Yoneda…
Miss Maria Tachibana…
…She seemed a bit rigid. Still, at least I've finally met someone who seems to be a member of the army.
But, this training or whatever…? Is she practicing something?
Now then… I can finally have an audience with his Excellency, Lieutenant General Yoneda.
(There are no openings in either her outfit or her posture.)
(Nice body…)
(Is this the color they call platinum blonde?)
(What pretty golden hair…)
(So she's a foreigner… Huh? But she was speaking Japanese just now.)
(I wonder what country she's from.)
Ah… N- no!
(What lovely green eyes…)
She has such a grave expression…
(…Glorious…)
(My… Impressive…)
…
…Excuse me!!
As of 12:00 today, Imperial Navy Ensign Ichiro Ogami, newly transferred to the Imperial Assault Troop,
Reporting for duty!
(Wh… who is this drunken old man!?)
(Th… this man… couldn't possibly be…!?)
You're really the Lieutenant? <br> Why're you drinking right now!
…Um… are you… really… his Excellency Lieutenant General Yoneda?
F-forgive me!
How can you drink sake in the middle of the day?!
Are you really that Lieutenant General Yoneda? You seem quite different from the rumors I've heard…
I heard Lt. General Yoneda was a hero of the Russo-Japanese War and the greatest strategist the Army has.
No… I hadn't said that much.
…I understand. But given that I have been transferred to the Imperial Assault Troop…
For the harmony and safety of the citizens of Teito… I intend to fight with my life on the line!
…
I see… So I'll be in disguise for this mission. That's just what I'd expect of a covert squad!
Understood! Ichiro Ogami, now proceeding to duty!
Yes, sir!
Ah, Mr. Ogami…
Ah… he's spotted us.
Sakura and… Iris, was it? What are you doing here?
Look, Sakura. This is why I said "we'd better run!"
…Well, you said, "let's go check on how he's doing," didn't you?!
And you said, "let's go, let's go!"
(…It seems the two of them were eavesdropping.)
It's not right to eavesdrop! <br> Where is the reception desk?
Here, now!! It's not right to eavesdrop!
…I'm sorry.
What!? And here I thought I'd show you around!
Well I don't care about you anymore! So long, bye-bye!
Ah, Iris! Wait right there!
Call Iris back. <br> Have Sakura lead the way.
Wa- wait, Iris! I guess I said a little much. I'm sorry.
Sniff… But, aren't you… angry at me?
Ah, dang it… Iris, don't cry. I'm not angry…
E-heh-heh, thanks. You're real nice, huh.
…That Iris. Tricking us with crocodile tears… Of all the nerve.
By the way, I'm sure you two would know, but…
Could you tell me the way to the reception desk, I wonder? It's my first duty here.
…I may have gone to far, but it's a lesson she needs to learn…
I'm sorry… It's partly my fault for not being more careful.
I'm just as much to blame. Anyway, Sakura, can you tell me where to find the reception desk?
You… did overhear why I need to go there, right?
Erk! …Really, now… Don't tease me like that, Ogami.
Yes, I know your first duty will be at the reception desk. Come on, let's go together.
I'm sorry… It's partly my fault for not being more careful.
I'm sorry. I'm worried about Iris, so… forgive me.
Ah… Just a second… She's gone.
No good… I receive my first official duty and I don't even know where the reception desk is.
Ensign Ogami, is something the matter?
You're… Miss Maria Tachibana… <br> right?
Yes, that's right. It seems you've already met with Manager Yoneda.
Yes. I've already received my first official duty. I was told to get changed and head for the reception desk.
Until I get used to it, I think I'd like to learn about my job a little at a time.
I see. That's an excellent attitude.
By the way, do you happen to know where the reception desk is?
Ah… that's right! And here I meant to ask how to get there…
…In that case, I'll show you the way.
Really? That would really help.
…It's a simple task. Please, come with me. It's very close.
Anyways… I was wondering, could I perhaps trouble you to tell me where the reception desk is?
It's my first task here. I'd like to get to the reception desk as soon as possible.
Here, now! What are you making a fuss about in front of the manager's office!?
Ah… you're-! The one from earlier…
Hey, Maria, listen! Sakura says-…
All I said was that I'd show Ogami around, but Iris, here-…
Both of you, stop that at once. It's almost time for practice to start, isn't it?
…As for the Ensign, I'll show him the way. You two head backstage.
Oh, that's no fun.
Well then, Ogami… Good luck with your work.
Now then, Ensign Ogami. I'll show you to the reception desk.
…Ye-yes, ma'am. If you would, please.
In that case, I'll lead the way. Come on, Ogami. Let's go.
No! He's going with me! Let's go, Uncle Ichi!
Ask Iris to show the way. <br> Ask Sakura to show the way. <br> Ask both to show the way. 
Sakura escorted me to the theater…So Iris, why don't you help me out this time?
Yeah! Let's go, let's go! See ya later, Sakura.
I-I see. I'd best be going, then…Go ahead, Iris…
C'mon, Uncle Ichi! Follow me!
Sakura, can I ask you to take me? My apologies for making you show me around all day…
It's no trouble at all. Shall we get going?
Well, hmph! I don't care about you anymore! So long, bye-bye!
Ogami…Iris left her parents behind in France and is staying here alone.
She tries to be strong, but she's actually quite lonely.
So…please be kind to her, all right?
I hadn't realized…
Well, I'll show you to the reception desk. Come on, let's go.
Now, both of you, don't fight. Let's all go together. …You wouldn't have any problem with that, right?
…Mm.
I'm sorry, Iris. I was being immature too.
No, it's all right. I'm happy as long as we're all together.
Ha-ha-ha, well looks like I've got a lady on each arm. Well then, lead the way, if you would.
(Things look like they could get disastrous if I say the wrong thing… I guess I'll just keep quiet.)
Here, now! What are you making a fuss about in front of the manager's office!?
Ah… you're-! The one from earlier…
Hey, Maria, listen! Sakura says-…
All I said was that I'd show Ogami around, but Iris, here-…
Both of you, stop that at once. It's almost time for practice to start, isn't it?
…As for the Ensign, I'll show him the way. You two head backstage.
Oh, that's no fun.
Well then, Ensign… Good luck with your work.
Now then, Ensign Ogami. I'll show you to the reception desk
…Ye- yes, ma'am. If you would, please.
Ogami, this is the reception desk.
I see. You really helped me out by showing me the way.
The ticket punch should be inside the desk. I have practice, so I'll be going now…
Ah…Wait a minute, Sakura…
What job am I supposed to do? <br> Uhh, the ticket puncher? <br> Good luck with your practice!
…By the way, what kind of work am I supposed to be doing here?
What? Didn't you hear from Manager Yoneda?
He told me that the new captain was going to do the ticket punching.
Ticket punching? What does that mean?
It's the job of punching guests' admission tickets.
Whaa? The work is punching tickets?! What kind of special mission is that?!
I don't know…I'm afraid I have no idea. I'm sorry.
Excuse me, young man. How long do you expect us to wait? You'd better hurry up and punch those tickets.
Today Sumire has the lead role in "Evening of the Camellia Princess." Hurry up!
Oh…I have to go now, Ogami. Good luck!
(What is the meaning of this…? This isn't what I was told!)
What do you mean… ticket punch? How do I use them?
The shape is a little strange, but they work the same as normal scissors, so you'll get the hang of it soon.
I have practice now, so please excuse me. Good luck, Ogami.
…Aww, she's gone.
I wanted to ask her what I'm supposed to be doing with this ticket punch…
Excuse me, young man. How long do you expect us to wait? You'd better hurry up and punch those tickets.
Today Sumire has the lead role in "Evening of the Camellia Princess." Hurry up!
W-what do you mean? I'm not in charge of tickets!
But here you are, wearing a ticket puncher's outfit. And aren't those the ticket punchers?
Ehh!? Can it be…that this is my secret duty…
In charge of punching tickets!? Th-that's insane!
Good luck with your practice, Sakura! …Although I don't know what kind of practice it is.
Thank you! I hope your ticket punching goes well too, Ogami!
(…Punching?)
…Aww, she's gone.
Uncle Ichi, here's the reception desk.
Thank you. You really helped out by bringing me here.
I've gotta go practice now. Look, here's the ticket punchers. Bye-bye, Uncle Ichi.
Ah… Wait a minute, Iris…
What job am I supposed to do? <br> Uhhh… ticket punching? <br> Good luck with your practice!
…By the way, what kind of work am I supposed to be doing here?
I dunno. Old man Yoneda said something about "punching tickets."
I guess he meant snip-snipping the tickets for the guests?
Whaa? The work is punching tickets?! What kind of special mission is that?!
It sounds like fun, so I'm happy for you, Uncle Ichi! I've gotta go now, so bye.
…What is the meaning of this? I thought I came here to be captain of the Imperial Assault Troop…
What do you mean… ticket punch? How do I use them?
Ehh, Uncle Ichi, you don't know how to use scissors? A-ha-ha-ha, you're funny.
You put them in your hand, go snip-snip, and you can cut holes in stuff.
Uh, no, what I meant to ask was, what should I do with these ticket punchers?
Ah, Maria's gonna get mad if I don't get to practice! See you later, Uncle Ichi!
…I've changed clothes and I have these ticket punchers…What am I supposed to be doing?
Good luck with your practice, Iris! …Although I don't know what kind of practice it is.
Thanks, Uncle Ichi…You're such a nice guy! …See you later, bye-bye!
…Hahaha, she's so cute and innocent.
…Aww, she's gone.
Excuse me, young man. How long do you expect us to wait? You'd better hurry up and punch those tickets.
Today Sumire has the lead role in "Evening of the Camellia Princess." Hurry up!
Wh-what are you talking about? I'm not in charge of the tickets.
But here you are, wearing a ticket puncher's outfit. And aren't those the ticket punchers?
Ehh!? Can it be…that this is my secret duty…
In charge of punching tickets!? Th-that's insane!
Ogami, this is the reception desk.
I see. You really helped out by bringing me here.
Uncle Ichi, the ticket punchers are inside the desk! Well, Sakura, let's go!
You're right, Iris. Ogami, we have practice, so… please excuse us.
Ah…wait a second, you two… 
What job am I supposed to do? <br> Uhhh… ticket punching? <br> Good luck with your practice!
Aww…They're both gone.
…By the way, what kind of work am I supposed to be doing here?
What? Didn't you hear from Manager Yoneda?
Old man Yoneda said he was gonna have you punch the tickets.
Punch the tickets? What tickets am I going to be punching?
It's the job of punching guests' admission tickets.
Whaa? What's that supposed to mean?! What kind of secret assignment is this?
I don't know…I'm afraid I have no idea. I'm sorry.
Excuse me, young man. How long do you expect us to wait? You'd better hurry up and punch those tickets.
Today Sumire has the lead role in "Evening of the Camellia Princess." Hurry up!
Sakura, if we don't go soon, they're gonna start practice without us.
Ah…you're right. W-well, Ogami, we'll be going now.
(What does this mean…the stories don't match up!)
What do you mean… ticket punchers? How do I use them?
Ehh, Uncle Ichi, you don't know how to use scissors? A-ha-ha-ha, you're funny.
You put them in your hand, go snip-snip, and you can cut holes in stuff.
Ah… Iris. We've got to get to training now…
You're right. Well, Uncle Ichi, bye-bye!
…I just wanted to find out what I should use the ticket punchers for, that was all…
Hey, sir. How long are you going to keep us waiting? Hurry up and punch my ticket!
Today Sumire has the lead role in "Evening of the Camellia Princess." Hurry up!
Wh-what's with these people? I'm not in charge of the tickets.
But here you are, wearing a ticket puncher's outfit. And aren't those the ticket punchers?
Ehh!? Can it be…that this is my secret duty…
In charge of punching tickets!? Th-that's insane!
You two, good luck with your practice! …Though I don't know what sort of practice it's supposed to be.
Thanks, Uncle Ichi. You should come by later and see, too!
Now then, Ogami, good luck with your ticket punching job too!
(…Punching?)
Ah… Iris. We've got to get to training now…
You're right. Well, Uncle Ichi, bye-bye!
…They're gone.
This is the reception area.
Thank you very much, Miss Maria.
…Since you are a superior officer, you may feel free to drop the "Miss" and just call me Maria.
The ticket punch should be inside the desk. Now then, I have practice, so please excuse me.
Ah, Miss Mari… rather, Maria. Wait just a second!
What job am I supposed to do? <br> Uhhh… ticket punch? <br> Good luck with your practice!
…By the way, what kind of work am I supposed to be doing here?
…Aww, she's gone.
Ensign Ogami…Did you not hear about this from the Manager?
Manager Yoneda had said that he was going to have you do the ticket punching…
Ticket punching? What does that mean?
It's the job of punching tickets for our guests.
Whaa? A job punching tickets?! What kind of secret mission is that?!
…Ensign, the guests are already lining up.
Hey, sir. How long are you going to keep us waiting? Hurry up and punch my ticket!
Today Sumire has the lead role in "Evening of the Camellia Princess." Hurry up!
Coming in direct contact with the audience is a very important job. Now then, please do your best.
(What is the meaning of this…? This isn't what I was told!)
What do you mean… ticket punch? How do I use them?
They're scissors used for punching the tickets. You should be able to figure out how to use them soon enough.
Huh? Scissors for punching the tickets? Why would I need to use such a thing?
Thank you, Maria. If you're doing a Assault Troop training session, I'll stop by myself later.
…Training?
Huh? …I must have assumed wrong. When you said "practice," I thought you meant some kind of training.
…Yes, of course we are diligent in our training.
But right now, we're about to practice our lines.
(Practice lines? Does she mean a briefing about some secret code the corps uses?)
Now, if you'll excuse me, Ensign. Good luck with your work.
T-thank you.
…By the way…What kind of work will I be doing?
Excuse me, young man. How long do you expect us to wait? You'd better hurry up and punch those tickets.
Today Sumire has the lead role in "Evening of the Camellia Princess." Hurry up!
Wh-what's with these people? I'm not in charge of the tickets!
But here you are, wearing a ticket puncher's outfit. And aren't those the ticket punchers?
Ehh!? Can it be…that this is my secret duty…
In charge of punching tickets!? Th-that's insane!
Hey, ticket puncher. How long are you going to keep us waiting? Hurry up and punch my ticket!
Y-yes. Umm… where do I punch the hole?
What the…, are you new here?! Man, you're wasting time.
Y-yes sir! Please hold on just a second!
(…Wasn't my mission to be captain of a covert squad?)
Everyone! I realize I look like a ticket puncher, but the truth is I-…
I'm the captain of the ICR! <br> I'm just a ticket puncher.
The truth is, I am the captain of the Imperial Assault Troop, Flower Division!
Huh??
There's no role of captain in the Flower Division.
In the first place, there's no way you, a man, could be in the Flower Division!
(…H-how can this be?! She doesn't believe me in the least!)
(No! The Flower Division is a secret corps… I mustn't let its name slip!)
…Though I may be punching tickets right now, the truth is… Actually I am just a ticket puncher.
Sir, are you all right!? Ah! It's already this late! The Flower Division's performance is going to start!
(She just said "Flower Division"… Why would an ordinary person know the name of a covert squad…?)
(…No. As the captain of a secret corps I can't afford to say such foolish things.)
What an uncivil ticket puncher! Ah! It's already this late! The Flower Division's performance is going to start!
(She just said "Flower Division"… Why would an ordinary person know the name of a covert squad…?)
Uh, um…
Ah, sorry. The punch, the punch. …All right, there you are.
Um… Do you happen to like Sumire Kanzaki?
She's just my type. <br> I don't care much for her…
Yes, though I haven't talked to her much yet, she is the type I like.
Eh!? You've had the chance to talk with Sumire!? I really envy you…
Oh yeah! Um… Could you possibly deliver this letter to Sumire for me?
Just tell her it's from a huge fan of hers. Please!
Y-yes sir… understood.
No, I don't care for her very much…
What did you say!? You don't appreciate her grace and elegance!?
To think someone like you is working in this theater… How deplorable!
(I think the fact that an Ensign of the Imperial Navy is punching tickets in a theater is pretty deplorable, too…)
I'm terribly sorry. I can't answer such questions.
…I see. Forgive me…
Um… I'm… a fan of Sumire. P-please, give her this letter!
W-well then, I've got to be going… I'm begging you!
Ah, j-just a second! Please, wait!
(Hmm - just what sort of a letter… is this?)
Hey! Ticket puncher man, here's my ticket!
Ye- yes. Let's see… now where do I punch a child's ticket?
Ah, this guy's new here! He doesn't even know how to clip tickets!
Handle the situation calmly. <br> Glare at the boy.
Here you are, boy. Here's your ticket.
Keep it up just like that.
(Wh-what an impertinent brat!)
Mister, do you think it's such a good idea to glare at your customers like that!?
(You brat… Get lost already!)
What's the matter? Say something.
(Damn it… you brat! Getting all cocky when I'm trying to keep quiet!)
…No matter how I look at it, this is just too odd. Just how is ticket punching a secret mission!?
All right. If it's come down to this, I'll try hearing what the others have to say. I may be able to learn something.
And if I'm not satisfied with that, I'll just have to question Lieutenant General Yoneda!
…Now then. Where should I go first?
Ye-yes. What is it?
Tsubaki, is it?
Hmm… so she's a salesgirl. She's a rather energetic girl.
…Now then, where should I go?
…Excuse me…  Are you Ensign Ichiro Ogami?
I'm Sakura Shinguji.
I received instructions from Lieutenant General Yoneda to provide escort for an Ensign Ogami.
Yes!
Imperial Assault Troop, Flower Division, Sakura Shinguji.
Pleased to make your acquaintance.
Do you find women difficult to rely on?
…Now then, let's proceed to the Grand Imperial Theatre.
You're mistaken.  Inside the Grand Imperial Theater is the Imperial Assault Troop's headquarters.
The essentials of the art of war, indeed.
Now then, let's proceed.
About me, you say…?
Unused
I'm still causing trouble all the time for everyone in the Revue.
But in order to defend the capital, I intend to work hard even if it means placing my life on the line.
Making the 'Koubu' work is a tough job.  But as fellow rookies, let's do our best together.
Come, Lieutenant General Yoneda is waiting!  Let's go!
Ogami, this is your first time here, isn't it.  Now then, let's go inside through the main lobby.
Unused
Well, today we're only performing at night…
A-ha! Hey, are you Sakura's boyfriend?
Iris! You mustn't tease your elders.
This is Ensign Ichiro Ogami, newly transferred to the Imperial Assault Troop.
Imperial Assault Troop, Flower Division, Iris.
And this is Jean-Paul, the bear, my very special friend.  Be nice to him.
Say, Sakura…
What's the matter?
This man has spiritual energy too…  He'll be fighting in a 'Koubu,' won't he.
That's right.
I… don't like it when people fight…
Unused
Don't worry, Iris.  Come on, let's go to your room.  I'll read to you from your Mother Goose book.
Okay.
Ah, Ensign Ogami.  Lieutenant General Yoneda is in the manager's office.
Well then, I will now be excusing myself.
Someone!  Please lend me a hand!
Ah!  You there!
Who else is there?  Stop looking like a fool and come here!
I wonder if you wouldn't perhaps pick up that dropped fork and exchange it for a new one for me?
My, then you mean to say I should pick it up myself?
You dare to suggest that the only daughter of Kanzaki Heavy Industries, the star actress of this theater, and, and…
…the top lady of Japanese high society, I, Sumire Kanzaki, should pick up a fork dropped on the floor!?
That is what you're saying, isn't it?! You're fired! I'll report this to the manager and see to it myself!
Ah… My, oh, no… Hahaha…
No wonder I thought I hadn't seen a waiter like you before… Forgive me.
Let's see… Ensign Ogawa, was it?

Mr. Yoneda is in the manager's office within.
Thank you.  By the way… I, the top star here, Sumire Kanzaki, have been cast aside…
…and before I was even aware, Miss Maria was made leader of our drama group.  What do you think of all this?
Honestly, that old fool Yoneda!  He has no eye for people!
Oh my, what shall I do!  How rude of me.  Hahaha…
Let's just keep what I said just now a secret from Mr. Yoneda!  Is that clear?  (Mwa!)
Eh-heh, there's no need to be shy.  That was just to see that the favor's returned…  I mean, just to see you off.
Ahh, Mr. Yoneda is in the manager's office. But do not mention what I just said to anyone! 
Do you understand, Ensign Ogawa?!
Enough, begone!!
Who might you be?
So you're Ichiro Ogami, newly transferred to the Revue.
Pleased to meet you. I'm Maria Tachibana.
Is there… something on my face?
Lieutenant General Yoneda is in the manager's office. I have training, so if you'll excuse me…
And one more thing, just as a warning. You shouldn't stare at a woman's face! Now then, excuse me!
Hey, come on in!
Yeaa, I heard da news from Coun' Hanakoj'. Na then, dere's no need for for'ality.
In da firsh place, y'know, thish is da Grand Imperia' Theater. You can't use dat military talk.
Well, how 'bout a round!?
Idiot! What's da big idea with thish "are you really" bit!?
Whash the matter, you can't figure out who I am without medals?! I'm Army Lt. General Yoneda Ikki!
Damn fool!
Okay! As long ash you undastand, thash fine. Now den, I will now start your firsh mishion!
Rumors…?  Hey, what sort of rumors!? Huh? Spit it out! 
The greatest strategist the Army has… and, he's the manager of the Grand Imperial Theater.
And on top of that, a drunken old man…
And thash what you don't like.
That ish what you're saying! But you know, Ogami…
No matter how mush military service I've performed and how many medals I've got, I've killed a loooot of people.
Enemies and allies alike… I've killed faaaar too many.
So, whash wrong with being the manager of a theater!?
Splendid! Er, rather… that's just splendid indeed! Now then, here's your first duty!
Why, you're a real uncivil fellow, aren't you? Well, no matter. Now then, here's your first duty!

Because when it comes down to it, this is a secret corps, after all.
I thought I told you that you don't need that formal talk! Now go already!

What's the matter? You seem distracted.

Now then, let's go. Lieutenant General Yoneda is waiting. 
But, before long, we'll be opening up, and the audience will come pouring back in. 
Just a moment, you! Can you not hear what I am saying? 
Cease your daydreaming, and pick up that fork right away!! 
Change into this and go to the reception desk! Hmph, in soldier's uniform like that you can't help standing out. 
Hello? Excuse me. 
Will you be with us starting today? Nice to meet you! I'd like to speak with you. 
I'm Tsubaki Takamura. I'm always working at the gift shop here. 
I've got photos of all the group members here, so please stop by to visit anytime!
