﻿It's a photo of Sakura. She's looking right at me. I wonder what she's thinking...
It's a photo of Sumire. This is a side of her you don't see too often.
It's a photo of Maria. ...She's lost in thought and looks kind of sad...
A photo of Kanna. She looks strong and reliable. I can't wait to meet her.
A photo of Iris. She's surrounded by flowers and flashing a radiant smile.
A photo of Kohran. She's looking pretty in profile with her face dyed red by the evening sun.
A letter given to me by a customer. I was asked to give it to Sumire. I have a bad feeling about this...
Maria's pistol. This may help me escape from here...
A hair ornament. It's decorated with flowers and looks very elegant.
A pretty pendant. The delicate workmanship is gorgeous.
A hairpin for use in a traditional bun hairstyle. It would complement a formal outfit well.
This key will let me enter rooms I couldn't before.
I found this in a bedroom on the second floor. I can use it to access the back room.
A teacup Iris asked me to get for her. It has a very stylish design.
This is the matchbox Iris asked for. Its logo is quite colorful.
A knife Iris asked me to get for her. Just a normal utensil you'd use during a meal.
A prop sword and shield used onstage. They're well-made and look just like the real thing.
A prop crown used onstage. It's well constructed and incredibly detailed.
A wig and costume used onstage. I wonder what kind of act could use a flashy outfit like this?
A photo of Sakura in her swimsuit. Wow, this is really something. I'm gonna treasure this.
A photo of Sumire in her stage costume. Her distinctive makeup really makes an impact.
It's a photo of Maria on stage in the military uniform from "For Love"... She's a beautiful woman disguised as a man.
A photo of Kanna in her training gear. Catching her in a private moment like this feels surprisingly intimate.
A photo of Iris in her swimsuit. She's holding a rubber ring and looks ready to have some fun. How cute.
A photo of Kohran. I don't get to see her with her braids undone very often. It's a nice look.
A photo of Ayame in a traditional outfit. I hope she'll always be as happy and content as she is here.
Ayame's gun. Why...? Why did it have to turn out like this...?
Jean-Paul the teddy bear. Iris's best friend. She always carries him with her and takes good care of him.
Maria! Are you okay!? 
I'm the captain of the Flower Division. Of course I care about everyone in it! 
… this could be a trap. It could be a mistake on my part. 
But… I refuse to leave you here!! 
Guwaah!! 
Ugh!! 
Ugh… M-Maria… 
Sakura! 
Maria, let's go! It's our turn now!

Hmhmhm… so you came, Ogami… you're quite courageous! 
Sir! 
The situation is as you can see… 
Sir, why did you come!? 
It's a trap!! Run! 
Don't throw everything away… I'm not worth it… 
Oh, spare me the melodrama! You can continue your whining in Hell!! 
On your feet, Ogami!! Can't have you dying so easily. Where's the fun in that…? 
Sir! 
A-hahaha…! What's the matter? I expected more from the leader of the Imperial Assault Troupe! 
Now then, time to finish this! 
Siiiiir! 
W-what's this!? 
Stop right there! 
Everyone!? 
H-how did you find this place…!? 
Times like this are exactly why we stick a tracker on the collar of everyone in the Troupe! 
Curses!! No matter, I have no problem finishing the lot of you! 
Lookit this punk, trying to act all tough. Now then… 
Time for you to pay the tab for hurting Maria! 
Captain! Leave this to us! 
Looks like Maria's Koubu is still okay. Hurry up and get in there, you two. 
Hurry!! 
Everyone… this is foolish! 
But… thanks!
