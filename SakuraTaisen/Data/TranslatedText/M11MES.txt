﻿I've got to focus!
Here I go!
Leave it to me!!
Watch this, Ogami.
I'm fine, I can still fight…
Thank you!
Keep it up, Ogami!
I knew I could count on you!
Kyaaa!
Ngh, I'll show you next time!
I'm sorry… Ogami…
It's my turn in the spotlight.
Hahaha!
I'm off!!
Today's performance is all for you!
It'll take more than that to bring me down…
Ensign, so you really do care for me…
Come, Ensign, it's your move!
I'll be watching you!
Uwahhh!!
I suppose I'll let you win for now!
The captain needs me!!
I'll have to take down the enemies myself!
Where's my next target!?
Whoever wants to die first, just step forward…
I'll be relying on your orders, sir!
I'm not finished yet!! Not yet!!
You would go that far… for my sake…
Focus, sir!
We'll make it out of this alive, sir!
Ahhh!!
They're too strong!! I need to withdraw!!
Forgive me, sir. I need to withdraw!
I can fight too!
Here I go!
I'm super strong!
I'll fight hard for Mon Frère!!
Uh, some of these lights are flashing…
You're the best, Mon Frère!
Go get 'em Mon Frère!
I'll be watching!
Kyaaaa!!
Stupid… stars…
Sorry, Mon Frère…
Gonna go all out.
Better not underestimate science~!
Movin' out!!
Check this out!
I'm takin' too much damage here!
Aww, you're the best!
I'm rootin' for ya!
Take 'em down, Chief!
Uwahhh…
Dangit… they got me…
Sorry Chief…
Alright! Let's do this!!
Full power! Hiyaaaaa!
Feast your eyes on the killer techniques of the Kirishima!
Let's take 'em down, Boss!!
No problem! It's just a scratch!!
Thanks! I owe you one!
Get in there, Boss!
Let's see what you can do!
Uwahhh…
Damn. Guess I still haven't trained enough…
I've gotta keep fighting… for the boss.
Alright!
We did it!
We did it!
Phew!
Nice one!
Woo! We did it!!
Roger!
What the…?! What is this place?
I can't believe there's a cavern like this under Nihonbashi…
What a hideous place this is!
Sir…there are suspicious structures further in!
What IS that?! It's so creepy; I hate it!
Those machines have to be trouble…no two ways about it.
This their stronghold? I can't wait to show 'em what for!
Look! There's a gate over there!
Have a look! There's a gate towards the back!
Sir, there appears to be a gateway towards the back!
Mon Frère, look! There's a gate back there!
Look, Chief! There's some kinda weird gate back thataway!
Over there, Boss! There's a gateway in the back!
Could Tenkai be inside?
But it looks like it's been sealed with some kind of dark power. How are we supposed to get it open?
Ogami…let's start by destroying those strange buildings!
Ensign, I believe our first priority should be to take care of these peculiar structures.
Sir. We should thoroughly dismantle each of these structures, one by one.
Mon Frère…let's smash every one of these weird things!
Chief…let's not get too reckless. For starters, we oughta bust up those funky-looking machines!
Boss…those buildings are makin' me uneasy. Let's wreck 'em!
There's one in front of the gate…
There is one in the very back…
Let's save the one by the gate for last…
There's one all the way back there…
There's one right in front of the gate…
To start, there's one of these things way in the back…
…another at the foot of the hill…
…another at the bottom of the hill…
…there's another structure here too, just like the other one…
…and there's one here…
…another just like it by that hill…
…one just like it right here…
…and one more on top of the hill. We need to destroy all three of them!
…and one more at the top. I have a feeling that a path will open for us once we destroy all three.
…and another here, identical to the others. In any case, we must destroy anything that blocks our way to that gate.
…and one more here. We hafta break all of them, Mon Frère!
…and one more over here. It looks like we can't get through until we smash 'em all.
…jeez, there's another one here, too. Let's start off by wrecking every last one of 'em!
And they all look pretty sturdy. The doors are the most likely weak point. Aim for their doors, everyone!
Let's go, everyone!
That's one down! Only two left!
Only two remaining.
It seems this is a factory for creating Hex Mechs. Let's make haste in destroying the remaining two!
Mon Frère, I got one! Just two more!
Looks like this is where they churn out the Hex Mechs. We better hurry and destroy the other two!
All right! That's one of these suckers down. Let's mop up the other two!
There! Two more to go, now!
Ogami, that's two we've destroyed now! Only one more to go!
Ensign, there's only one left now.
Sir, there's just one more remaining. Let's hurry.
Just one left!
That's two we've wrecked now! Only one more left!
Boss, there's only one more. Psych yourself up and let's finish this!
There…everyone, there's just one more remaining. Let's make short work of it!
Ogami, I've destroyed the last one!
Ensign! The final one has been destroyed!
Sir, we've taken out the last of them!
Mon Frère, we've wrecked every single one now!
Chief, that's the last one gone!
Boss! We finally took out the last of 'em!
Well done, everyone! With this, we've put an end to their production of Rear Guards for the time being.
…Huh?!
All right! Let's head inside!
Those three machines are factories for creating Rear Guards.
Each one has a weak point at the door. If you focus your attacks there, you'll be able to destroy them.
Sakura trusts you from the depths of her heart. Try attacking with her when you have enough Willpower.
Sumire trusts you from the depths of her heart. Try attacking with her when you have enough Willpower.
Maria trusts you from the depths of her heart. Try attacking with her when you have enough Willpower.
Iris trusts you from the depths of her heart. Try attacking with her when you have enough Willpower.
Kanna trusts you from the depths of her heart. Try attacking with her when you have enough Willpower.
Kohran trusts you from the depths of her heart. Try attacking with her when you have enough Willpower.
I think everyone will be fine without my protection.
I will protect you, Sakura!
I'll always be there to protect you, Sumire.
Let me watch your back for you, Maria.
I'll always be there for you, Iris.
Don't worry, Kohran! I'll protect you!
Kanna! I've got your back!
