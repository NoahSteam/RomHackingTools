﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿It's a photo of Sakura. She's looking right at me. I wonder what she's thinking…
It's a photo of Sumire. This is a side of her you don't see too often.
It's a photo of Maria. She's lost in thought and looks kind of sad…
A photo of Kanna. Her signature strength comes through clearly.
A photo of Iris. She's surrounded by flowers and flashing a radiant smile.
A photo of Kohran. She's looking pretty in profile with her face dyed red by the evening sun.
A letter given to me by a customer. I was asked to give it to Sumire. I have a bad feeling about this…
Maria's pistol. This may help me escape from here…
A hair ornament. It's decorated with flowers and looks very elegant.
A pretty pendant. The delicate workmanship is gorgeous.
A hairpin for use in a traditional bun hairstyle. It would complement a formal outfit well.
This key will let me enter rooms I couldn't before.
I found this in a bedroom on the second floor. I can use it to access the back room.
A set of cups Iris asked me to get for her. They have a very stylish design.
This is the matchbox Iris asked for. Its logo is quite colorful.
Some knives Iris asked me to get for her. Just a normal utensil you'd use during a meal.
A prop sword and shield used onstage. They're well-made and look just like the real thing.
A prop crown used onstage. It's well constructed and incredibly detailed.
A wig and costume used onstage. I wonder what kind of act could use a flashy outfit like this?
A photo of Sakura in her swimsuit. Wow, this is really something. I'm gonna treasure this.
A photo of Sumire in her stage costume. Her distinctive makeup really makes an impact.
It's a photo of Maria on stage in the military uniform from "For Love"… She's a beautiful woman disguised as a man.
A photo of Kanna in her training gear. Catching her in a private moment like this feels surprisingly intimate.
A photo of Iris in her swimsuit. She's holding a rubber ring and looks ready to have some fun. How cute.
A photo of Kohran. I don't get to see her with her braids undone very often. It's a nice look.
A photo of Ayame in a traditional outfit. I hope she'll always be as happy and content as she is here.
Ayame's gun. Why…? Why did it have to turn out like this…?
Jean-Paul the teddy bear. Iris's best friend. She always carries him with her and takes good care of him.
(…If you look closely, she's still wearing her stage hairdo.) 
(…She must have come here in a big hurry after the play ended.) 
(As always, that's some wild hair.) 
(It's Kanna's trademark headband. It always looks so good on her.) 
(I've heard that the store even sells "Kanna Headbands" for her kid fans.) 
(Wow…You don't usually see Kanna looking like this.) 
(I wonder what happened here…? Kanna's got a troubled look in her eyes.) 
(I wonder if she ran out of time… Her clothes are all over the place.) 
(Why was Kanna in such a rush?) 
(Oho?! Maybe it's my imagination, but it seems like I can see more than usual…) 
(No! I can't believe I'm staring at Kanna's chest while she's upset…What am I doing?!) 
(O-Oh nooo! My eyes are drawn like a magnet to her breasts!) 
Boss… What exactly are you looking at?! 
Boss! You're too late… Gnnnnh… W-W-Water…! 
Goodness, the water is right here. This is why I can't stand people who don't know their manners. 
Check this out, Chief! Behold the secrets of 4 millennia of Chinese traditions! …Alley-oop! 
I expected this kind of thing, so I prepared for it. Aaaaand, again! 
Applaud. <br> Give a level-headed critique. <br> Break into laughter. 
Wow! Way to go, Kohran! When did you learn that?! 
Don't underestimate me, Chief! Every Chinese person is able to do this from birth! 
Oh… really? But still, it's an awesome trick! 
You're gonna make me blush… Look, I can even do this! 
Oooh! The plates are multiplying! 
That was contortionist plate spinning! And now… disappearing plate spinning! 
There's a lot of variants… 
I’m going all out because of what you said earlier, Chief. 
So thanks a lot. If you're happy, I'm happy. 
Kohran! We'll add our plates when they're empty! 
Kohran, Kohran! Try spinning cups! 
Think big, try spinning a pot! 
A pot, a gun… I'll spin anything you can throw at me! 
…That's not good enough, Kohran! 
Wh-Wh-What?! 
Your plate spinning is impressive, I admit. But it's not a proper party trick! 
That's true. A true party trick… has to be improvised. 
Some technique you have honed for years is no good for that. 
What on earth are the two of you on about? 
In China, plate spinning is an officially certified party trick. 
So yeah, this is the real deal! You're looking at a bona fide party trick! 
Haha! Is that… “primate” spinning?! Incredible! 
What are you sayin', Chief?! I'm spinning "plates," not "primates"! 
…Oh? Is that right? 
Of course! If you tried spinning a monkey on a stick, animal rights organizations would come after you! 
Y-You're right… I WAS thinking it sounded kind of strange. 
Careful Chief, you're losing it. 
… 
What is it, Chief? Cat got your tongue? 
No, I'm just… speechless because I'm in awe. 
For real? 
Y-Yes, really! It's an impressive technique! 
It's nothing special, really. In China, everyone is able to spin plates. 
What, really? 
Look, I can even do this! Globe spinning! 
Wow! Plates spinning on top of the other plates! Incredible, Kohran! 
Hehehe… You’re gonna make me blush from all this praise… 
Kohran! We'll add our plates when they're empty! 
Kohran, Kohran! Try spinning cups! 
Think big, try spinning a pot! 
A pot, a gun… I'll spin anything you can throw at me! 
Listen, it's great that you're having fun, but we can't do this until tomorrow. 
But this is our big season's end celebration! Let's not hold back! 
Yeah, yeah. 
…But still! I'm not completely satisfied with the casting for our summer play, "Journey to the West." 
Why did I have to play the Demoness? 
But you were a spectacular success! The children in the front row cried like crazy. 
What was that?! 
Oh… nothing at all. 
Hahaha! It's great that we can have a good laugh like this after a long performance season.
Open your mouth, Mon Frère! 
Aaaaaah… 
Hehehe… Next, I'll grab some juice… Oh? 
There's no juice left! 
…We’re all out here as well! Sakura was supposed to buy some more… 
But she's late. She didn't run into a ghost, did she? 
Now that you mention it, I'm starting to worry… Oh, look outside… 
It started raining. 
It's one of those sudden evening showers. Maybe that's what’s holding her up? 
Hm… A ghost? 
Oh! I have a brilliant idea! Let's all dress up as ghosts and scare Sakura! 
And when she's really scared, we'll just say, "Oops, sorry!" What a great way to kick off the party! 
Great idea! Let's do it! <br> That's a bit much… 
Great idea! Let's do it! We'll have a jolly good laugh! 
Yay! I'll be a scary ghost! 
You really wanna do that, Chief? Well, I guess a party is a good opportunity to go wild. 
I just hope Sakura won't be mad at us… 
Nah, we'll just apologize to her. It's just a prank, after all… 
You're really something, all of you… 
That's a bit much… She comes home in the middle of that rain shower, and we play a trick like that on her? 
You're absolutely right, Captain. Dressing up as ghosts? What are we, children? 
… 
You can't be serious, all of you! She's out shopping in that rain, don't you feel sorry for her? 
Dressing up as ghosts? What are we, children? 
I'm a child! So does that mean I can be a ghost at least? 
Oh! Now you suddenly want to be treated like a child?! 
Well, I'm in… But will Sakura really be afraid of some ghosts? 
A valid question. That boor won't be much fazed by ghosts, methinks. 
Well, that's fine too. Even funnier in a way, if she just stands there confused. 
Alrighty, let's start preparations! If we use this tablecloth… 
…Yes, this is perfect! 
Now let's kill the lights. 
It's still raining. 
My heart is pounding! 
…! Shhhh… Sakura's coming! 
Oh dear, I'm late… 
(Not yet… wait until she opens the door…) 
Ahem… It's me, Sakura. Sorry I'm late. 
(Hehehe… Any moment now…) 
…!? A bolt of lightning? 
What?! Sakura didn't even enter the room, so… what scared her? 
Go help Sakura. <br> Keep waiting. 
Sakura! What happened? Are you all right? 
(Let's not move too soon now… Gotta be patient…) 
This is bad! Sakura! Are you all right? 
(Oh no! I have to react somehow!) 
Sakura! What happened? Are you all right? 
Damn it, not now…! 
I'll leave it to you! <br> I can't leave Sakura… 
Got it, I'll leave it to you! 
B-But… I can't leave Sakura like this… 
Damn it… What should I do? 
… 
Ogami, reporting for duty. 
There you are! 
Our steam processor has finally revealed the Hive's objective! 
What?! <br> What's a steam processor? 
What?! How did it do that? 
What's a steam processor? 
Don't tell me… you've never seen our steam processor in the room back there? 
Well… in fact… 
Oh dear, then I'll have to tell you. 
As its name implies, it's a steam-powered device that calculates, analyzes and processes information. 
Its logic circuits can do calculations a hundred times faster than the human brain. 
Wow, that's incredible! 
It really is, isn't it? We can easily calculate our enemies' strategy or which horse is going to win the race. 
Which horse…? 
Lt. General Yoneda… 
Oh, er… ahem! Let us return to the matter at hand! 
After analyzing all the points where the Hive appeared, it discovered one common element. 
Hey! Are you even listening to what I'm saying? 
Y-Yes, sir! Sorry, sir! 
I was just… thinking about Sakura… 
Ogami… did something happen with Sakura? 
Yeah… you could say that. 
I understand you're worried, but… 
This is important intel. You have to pay attention! 
O-Of course. 
After analyzing all the points where the Hive appeared, one common element was discovered. 
After every one of their attacks, a strange machine was left behind. 
A machine? 
Yes… like this one. 
What is that? 
An ancient ritual object kept in Kaneiji Temple in Ueno… We call it "The Connector." 
Kaneiji Temple…? What does that have to do with the Hive of Darkness? 
Kaneiji was founded 400 years ago by none other than High Priest Tenkai. Leader of the Hive of Darkness. 
Tenkai! 
Take a look at this… 
The red spots mark the places where we found Connectors… Shiba, Tsukiji, Asakusa, Kudanshita and Fukagawa. 
If we add the next location being predicted by the steam processor, Hibiya Park, then… 
What is this?! 
They form a magical force field around Tokyo! 
If this force field is completed, the capital will be under the control of those demons! 
The destruction it will cause in the city is impossible to predict. 
Heavens will rend, the earth will split. We'll have unending disasters and Tokyo will be doomed for eternity! 
This is what they were planning all along. 
This… This is horrible. 
It cannot be verified if the Hive’s leader really is the same Tenkai from 400 years ago… 
But one thing is clear. For them, we are tainted by western culture and are defiling this city. 
We cannot let the capital, which we built with our own blood, sweat and tears, fall to the hands of those demons.
We must prevent their plan from coming to fruition, no matter the cost. 
Yes, sir! 
The steam processor predicts that their next target will be Hibiya Park. 
Ensign Ogami, you and the Flower Division are to prepare for battle and get ready to intervene! 
Roger, sir! 
Destroying Tokyo with a magical force field… The Hive of Darkness has truly been weaving a diabolical plan. 
I have to get the Flower Division ready for battle. 
That said… I wonder how Sakura is doing. 
Ah… Sakura! How… How are you? 
… 
(Sakura…)

Ah… 
Sakura! 
Sakura! What is wrong with you? 
T-The Thunder God… is going to take me away! 
What? 
Sakura, are you serious? 
Give me a break. I wouldn't have taken you for a scaredy-cat. 
Ensign Ogami, Ensign Ogami. Please report to General Yoneda in the Command Room immediately. 
Ensign, the commander wants to see you. We have to hurry to the Command Room. 
Ensign. Please leave this to me. 
If she's that afraid of thunder… I wonder how she could ever ride a Koubu! 
I'm afraid of thunder too. 
Sakura… She must have remembered something from her childhood. 
Can I…bother you for a moment?
