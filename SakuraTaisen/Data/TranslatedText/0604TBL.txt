It's a photo of Sakura. She's looking right at me. I wonder what she's thinking…
It's a photo of Sumire. This is a side of her you don't see too often.
It's a photo of Maria. …She's lost in thought and looks kind of sad…
A photo of Kanna. Kanna's signature strength comes through clearly.
A photo of Iris. She's surrounded by flowers and flashing a radiant smile.
A photo of Kohran. She's looking pretty in profile with her face dyed red by the evening sun.
A letter given to me by a patron. I was asked to give it to Sumire. I have a bad feeling about this…
Maria's pistol. This may help me escape from here…
A hair ornament. It's decorated with flowers and looks very elegant.
A pretty pendant. The delicate workmanship is gorgeous.
A hairpin for use in a traditional bun hairstyle. It would complement a formal outfit well.
This key will let me enter rooms I couldn't before.
I found this in a bedroom on the second floor. I can use it to access the back room.
A teacup Iris asked me to get for her. It has a very stylish design.
This is the matchbox Iris asked for. Its logo is quite colorful.
A knife Iris asked me to get for her. Just a normal utensil you'd use during a meal.
A prop sword and shield used onstage. They're well-made and look just like the real thing.
A prop crown used onstage. It's well-constructed and incredibly detailed.
A wig and costume used onstage. I wonder what kind of act could use a flashy outfit like this?
A photo of Sakura in her swimsuit. Wow, this is really something. I'm gonna treasure this.
A photo of Sumire in her stage costume. Her distinctive makeup really makes an impact.
It's a photo of Maria on stage in the military uniform from "For Love"… She's a beautiful woman disguised as a man.
A photo of Kanna in her training gear. Catching her in a private moment like this feels surprisingly intimate.
A photo of Iris in her swimsuit. She's holding a rubber ring and looks ready to have some fun. How cute.
A photo of Kohran. I don't get to see her with her braids undone very often. It's a nice look.
A photo of Ayame in a traditional outfit. I hope she'll always be as happy and content as she is here.
Ayame's gun. Why…? Why did it have to turn out like this…?
Jean-Paul the teddy bear. Iris's best friend. She always carries him with her and takes good care of him.
(…If you look closely, she's still wearing her stage hairdo.)
(…She must have come here in a big hurry after the play ended.)
(As always, that's some wild hair.)
(It's Kanna's trademark headband. It always looks so good on her.)
(I've heard that the store even sells "Kanna Headbands" for her kid fans.)
(Wow…You don't usually see Kanna looking like this.)
(I wonder what happened here…? Kanna's got a troubled look in her eyes.)
(I wonder if she ran out of time… Her clothes are all over the place)
(Why was Kanna in such a rush?)
(Oho?! Maybe it's my imagination, but it seems like I can see more than usual…)
(No! I can't believe I'm staring at Kanna's chest while she's upset…What am I doing?!)
(O-oh nooo! My eyes are drawn like a magnet to her breasts!)
Captain…What exactly are you looking at?!
Captain! I'm sorry I'm late! Wa….water….
Of course, it's right here. I was worried about you going because of the bad people

It could be like this, I studied it. And…well that's it.
Applause <br> Criticize calmly <br> Come to laugh about it.
Oh! Cool Kohran! When will we do this trick?

Is it…is it alright?
I'd like to speak with you alone…
I…I was a tomboy as a child…
I had a friend named Takeshi who I used to play and fight with…
One day, Grandma told me I couldn't play outside, but I invited Takeshi out anyway…
We were climbing trees. Then, suddenly…the sky turned pitch black…
Sakura, the Thunder God is angry! Hurry, we've gotta hide…
I'm fine! I'm not scared of some stupid Thunder God!
Takeshi! Takeshi! Takeshiii!
Takeshi was taken by the Thunder God.
All because I didn't listen to my grandma…
Untranslated
Ever since then…I've been scared of the Thunder God…scared that someday, I'll be taken away like Takeshi…
Silly, isn't it? Me, a pilot who rides the Koubu into battle, afraid of the Thunder God…
Kyaaaaah?!
Yes…T-the Thunder God is angry…

Heehee! Really now, Ogami…
B-but…
Ogami…
Are you sure you can do this?
Yeah!
Welcome to our shop. Good morning! What can I do for you?
Ah, Ogami, welcome! What can I do for you?
