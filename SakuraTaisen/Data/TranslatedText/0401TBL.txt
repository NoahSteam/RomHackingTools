﻿﻿﻿﻿It's a photo of Sakura. She's looking right at me. I wonder what she's thinking… 
It's a photo of Sumire. This is a side of her you don't see too often. 
It's a photo of Maria. She's lost in thought and looks kind of sad… 
It's a photo of Kanna. Her signature strength comes through clearly. 
It's a photo of Iris. She's surrounded by flowers and flashing a radiant smile. 
It's a photo of Kohran. She's looking pretty in profile with her face dyed red by the evening sun. 
A letter given to me by a customer. I was asked to give it to Sumire. I have a bad feeling about this… 
Maria's pistol. This may help me escape from here… 
A hair ornament. It's decorated with flowers and looks very elegant. 
A pretty pendant. The delicate workmanship is gorgeous. 
A hairpin for use in a traditional bun hairstyle. It would complement a formal outfit well. 
Jean-Paul the teddy bear. Iris's best friend. She always carries him with her and takes good care of him. 
This key will let me enter rooms I couldn't before. 
I found this in a bedroom on the second floor. I can use it to access the back room. 
A set of cups Iris asked me to get for her. They have a very stylish design. 
This is the matchbox Iris asked for. Its logo is quite colorful. 
Some knives Iris asked me to get for her. Just a normal utensil you'd use during a meal. 
A prop sword and shield used onstage. They're well-made and look just like the real thing. 
A prop crown used onstage. It's well constructed and incredibly detailed. 
A wig and costume used onstage. I wonder what kind of act could use a flashy outfit like this? 
It's a photo of Sakura in her swimsuit. Wow, this is really something. I'm gonna treasure this. 
It's a photo of Sumire in her stage costume. Her distinctive makeup really makes an impact. 
It's a photo of Maria on stage in the uniform from "For Love"… a beautiful woman disguised as a man. 
It's a photo of Kanna in her training gear. Catching her in a private moment like this feels surprisingly intimate. 
It's a photo of Iris in her swimsuit. She's holding a rubber ring and looks ready to have some fun. How cute. 
It's a photo of Kohran. I don't get to see her with her braids undone very often. It's a nice look. 
It's a photo of Ayame in a traditional outfit. I hope she'll always be as happy and content as she is here. 
Ayame's gun. Why…? Why did it have to turn out like this…? 
Ogami, you moron! How could you let this happen under your watch!? 
Jeez, Chief… looks like you've really done it this time… 
…Well, she did bust up a whole movie theater… can't really argue with this outcome. 
Well, she busted up a water fountain in broad daylight… can't really argue with this outcome. 
Would you please be quiet?! I can't hear what they're saying! 
I'm sorry. I should have kept a better eye on her. 
… 
I take full responsibility. <br> Iris, apologize too! 
…I take full responsibility for this incident. I accept any punishment you deem necessary. 
But remember… Iris is still just a child. 
Ah!! W-Wait, Iris!! 
Iris, you should apologize too! When you do something wrong, you apologize! 
Ah!! W-Wait, Iris!! 
What are you thinking, sir?! Pull yourself together! 
Sorry, I don't know what to say… 
… 
Ah!! W-Wait, Iris!! 
…Hmm? Sounds like someone's running this way. 
H-Hey! Watch out! 
Kyaaaaah! 
You three… you were eavesdropping! 
I… Iris… 
She ran that way… 
Toward… her room… 
…What am I supposed to do? 
Go after Iris. <br> Go back inside. <br> Help these three. 
Iris, wait! 
Looks like Iris ran off to her room… 
Sir… there's nothing Iris hates more than being treated like a child… 
That's why I was trying to punish her as I would an adult… 
Ogami… you might be able to get through to Iris. 
This is a test of your abilities as a captain. I'm counting on you. 
Of course… 
All right then, get going. Don't let us down, Ogami. 
(Yikes, I might have to break out a bicycle pump to reinflate these three…) 
Hey, are you all OK? 
…C-Chief… I think you've got bigger things to worry about. 
You should be going after Iris… 
I think… she shut herself in her room… 
…Right. 
…What should I do? 
…C-Chief… you should go after her… 
You should be going after Iris… 
I think… she shut herself in her room… 
… 
…Right. 
Oh, Ogami… 
Sakura, did Iris come by here? 
Yes, she went into her room… She was running pretty hard… 
OK… thanks. 
(I wonder if she'll let me in…) 
Well, I can't go anywhere until I at least try to see Iris… 
Iris, it's Ogami… Can I come in? 
… 
Iris… 
Shoot… I don't think she's in any mood to listen to me. 
Boss! Leave this to us! 
Chief, ever heard the saying that “if you can't push, try pulling”? 
You can't solve everything by just charging straight ahead! Let us help you! 
Settle down and let me handle this. Listen, Iris wants to grow up fast, right? 
Well, since I'm the biggest person here, she'll definitely listen to what I say. 
…I honestly pity simpletons like you… 
Who on earth would want to grow up to be a giant muscle-head like you? 
Excuse me? 
What Iris wants is an adult's beauty. 
Meaning, she wants to grow up to be a lovely lady like myself… 
…Is this really the time for us to be fighting over this? 
Chief, would you pick one of us to handle this? 
Ask Sumire. <br> Ask Kanna. <br> Ask Kohran. 
All right. Sumire, would you handle it? 
Leave it to me. I will most certainly get through to her. 
Iris! I know all about wanting to grow up as quickly as possible. 
How about I show you how to put on makeup like a beautiful lady? 
I just need you to open the door for me. 
… 
Whoa… She opened the door!? 
What else did you expect? Now excuse me while I go set things straight with her. 
…I'm turning on the lights. 
… 
If I put on makeup, will I be beautiful? Will that make me a grown-up? 
Well no amount of makeup will work if you're wearing a frown like that. 
When you're putting on makeup, the most important thing is to smile. OK, Iris? 
If…I smile when I put on makeup, will I be a grown up then? 
Of course! Now let's see a smile… 
… 
(Hohohoho… She's buying it.) 
(Talking her down is like taking candy from a baby for me.) 
…!! 
…? Is something the matter, Iris? 
Sumire… you liar. 
Liar! Sumire, you liar! Liar! LIAR!! 
I-Iris… 
That was just a joke… I didn't mean anything by it. Just calm down… 
…? 
W-What's going on!? 
Sumire!? 
I failed… It appears our Iris…can read people's minds. 
W-What! Are you serious!? 
If that's true, then we're in a real bind! 
Ensign… it seems approaching Iris without real conviction will only hurt her more. 
I think we should leave her be for now. 
…Guess we have no choice but to pull back for now. 
OK, Kanna, I'm leaving it to you. 
You got it. Just you watch, I'll get through to her. 
Iris, it's me. You want to get big as fast as you can, right? 
If that's what you want, just leave it to me. I can show you how. 
… 
Whoa… She opened the door!? 
Whoa, it's pretty dark in here… I'm gonna turn on the lights. 
… 
Can I really… Can I really grow up faster? I can be a grown-up? 
Aww, no need to rush. First of all you should take a bite of my super awesome specialty lunch. 
It's a little spicy, but if you gobble this down you'll get bigger in no time. 
…Really? If I eat this… I'll be a grown-up? 
Of course! Now go ahead and eat up! 
… 
(Looks like it's working.) 
(It's hard to stay grumpy with a full stomach. This should perk her right up.) 
?! 
…? What's the matter, Iris. Aren't you gonna eat it? 
Kanna… you liar. 
Liar… Kanna, you liar. Liar! LIAR!! 
I-Iris? 
W-Wait! J-Just hear me out… 
…? 
W-What's going on!? 
K-Kanna!? 
Heheheh, well, looks like we're in a bind. Seems our Iris can read people's minds. 
W-What? Then we'll never cheer her up with smooth talking! 
…I don't think even I could convince a telepath. 
If we go in there half-cocked it'll just make things worse, Boss. 
I think it'd be best just to leave her alone, for now. 
Yeah, I think we'd better retreat for now. You too, Ogami… 
OK, Kohran, I'll leave it up to you. 
You got it, Chief! I'll get through to her! 
Iris, it's Kohran. You want to grow up faster, right? 
I've got a 4,000 year-old special Chinese remedy here that'll do the trick for you. 
… 
Whoa… She opened the door!? 
Just sit tight and watch, Chief. 
Can't say your room is a pretty sight like this… I'm gonna turn on the lights, Iris. 
… 
…Just drop off the medicine and leave me alone. 
Now just a minute… you've got to use this medicine properly or it won't work. 
When you take this… you've got to open your heart and think happy thoughts. 
Happy thoughts…? 
That's right, if you take the medicine in your current mood it won't work. It's expensive, so we don't want to waste it, right? 
… 
(There we go… she's falling for it!) 
(I just need her to smile. Once she's smiling, all those good feelings will follow!) 
…! 
…? What's the matter, Iris? C'mon, let's see a smile. 
Kohran… you liar. 
Liar… Kohran, you liar… Liar! LIAR!! 
I-Iris? 
H-Hold on! V-Violence is against the rules! 
…? 
W-What's going on!? 
K-Kohran!? 
Ah… This is bad. Iris can read minds. She saw right through me. 
W-What! Are you serious!? 
…I don't think even I could convince a telepath. 
Chief, I think sweet talk is just gonna get us in trouble here. 
I think we just need to wait until she calms down… 
…Well, I guess we should retreat for now too. 
… 
What should I do? 
Go back to your room. <br> Talk to her one more time. 
…I can't get through to Iris right now… 
…I should just head back to my room and think of what to do next. 
…Ogami. 
…As her captain, I can't just give up. I'm going to go try to talk to her one more time. 
Ogami… wait just a moment. 
…What should I do? 
…Ogami. 
Ma'am… 
Ogami… you look quite troubled. 
Yeah… how can I get Iris to listen to me? 
…That's a difficult question. 
Sumire and the others see Iris as a child… 
Kanna and the others see Iris as a child… 
Kohran and the others see Iris as a child… 
But, Maria is trying to treat her as an adult… 
Ogami, what do you think? 
I think Maria is right. <br> Sumire and them are right. <br> I think they're both wrong. 
I think Maria is right. <br> Kanna and them are right. <br> I think they're both wrong. 
I think Maria is right. <br> Kohran and them are right. <br> I think they're both wrong. 
I think… Maria is right. 
Iris hates being treated as a child… 
True… Iris does clearly dislike being treated as a child… 
But that's because she's stuck right now, between being an adult and being a child. 
She's trying to become an adult right now. Desperately. Don't forget that. 
…Now it's up to you to think of what to do next, Ogami. We're counting on you. 
Ayame… 
I think… Sumire and the others are right. 
I think… Kanna and the others are right. 
I think… Kohran and the others are right. 
Iris is a child, after all. If we awkwardly try to treat her as an adult, I think she'll just rebel. 
True… As you said, Iris is a child right now. 
But… she's on the verge of adulthood. 
She is? 
Yes… I believe that's why she has such a complex about being treated like a child. 
You must understand that, Ogami, if you want to open her heart. 
Ayame… 
I… I think both sides are incorrect. 
… 
…Well, if you understand that, then I don't think there's anything left for me to say. 
The next step is up to you, Ogami. We're counting on you. 
Ayame… 
… 
Of course… This is a difficult question. 
For now, let's just leave Iris alone. 
What to do after that is for you to decide, Ogami. 
Ma'am…

One wrong move and that could have been a disaster. Think about what you've done. 
Hmph. I didn't do anything wrong. 
Iris… do you really not understand what you've done? 
No. It's not my fault! I didn't do anything! 
Letting your powers run wild is dangerous. 
Come now, Maria, no need to be so upset… Yelling will give you wrinkles, you know. 
That's not going to cut it! Iris needs to take responsibility and be punished! 
Ensign! These things happen because you spoil her! 
Stop treating me like a kid! 
It's not my fault!

No! I didn't do anything wrong!
