﻿﻿﻿﻿It's a photo of Sakura. She's looking right at me. I wonder what she's thinking… 
It's a photo of Sumire. This is a side of her you don't see too often. 
It's a photo of Maria. …She's lost in thought and looks kind of sad… 
It's a photo of Kanna. Her signature strength comes through clearly. 
It's a photo of Iris. She's surrounded by flowers and flashing a radiant smile. 
It's a photo of Kohran. She's looking pretty in profile with her face dyed red by the evening sun. 
A letter given to me by a patron. I was asked to give it to Sumire. I have a bad feeling about this… 
Maria's pistol. This may help me escape from here… 
A hair ornament. It's decorated with flowers and looks very elegant. 
A brooch. It's a beautiful piece of delicate craftsmanship. 
A hairpin for use in a traditional bun hairstyle. It would compliment a formal outfit well. 
Jean-Paul the teddy bear. Iris's best friend. She always carries him with her and takes good care of him. 
This key will let me enter rooms I couldn't before. 
I found this in a bedroom on the second floor. I can use it to access the back room. 
A teacup Iris asked me to get for her. It has a very stylish design. 
This is the matchbox Iris asked for. Its logo is quite colorful. 
A knife Iris asked me to get for her. Just a normal utensil you'd use during a meal. 
A prop sword and shield used onstage. They're well-made and look just like the real thing. 
A prop crown used onstage. It's well-constructed and incredibly detailed. 
A wig and costume used onstage. I wonder what kind of act could use a flashy outfit like this? 
It's a photo of Sakura in her swimsuit. Wow, this is really something. I'm gonna treasure this. 
It's a photo of Sumire in her stage costume. Her distinctive makeup really makes an impact. 
It's a photo of Maria on stage in the military uniform from "For Love"… She's a beautiful woman disguised as a man. 
It's a photo of Kanna in her training gear. Catching her in a private moment like this feels surprisingly intimate. 
It's a photo of Iris in her swimsuit. She's holding a rubber ring and looks ready to have some fun. How cute. 
It's a photo of Kohran. I don't get to see her with her braids undone very often. It's a nice look. 
It's a photo of Ayame in a traditional outfit. I hope she'll always be as happy and content as she is here. 
Ayame's gun. Why…? Why did it have to turn out like this…? 
Ayame… 
… 
… 
I know it's hard for everyone, but we don't know when the Kouma will attack again. 
We have to get some rest. 
I guess so… 
Those girls need someone to rely on right now… And that someone is you. 
… 
Would you mind checking on everyone? 
…Understood! 
Just talk to all of them, then come back to me. 
Ogami… This can't be right. Ayame can't have been our enemy… 
That's… That's just not possible! 
Ogami… 
How could everything come to this? 
I'll never forgive her for trying to trick me… 
Sumire… 
She must think I'm stupid… 
Ensign, that was a brilliant reaction… To shoot in that situation… 
But… Ayame, she… 
Is this a dream? Then I want to wake up… 
This is… 
How could this happen? 
What… What should I do? 
Ayame, tell me… What should I do? 
Chief… Why did it come to this? 
Auntie Ayame looked SO scary back then… What was up with her? 
Mon Frère… Tell me, what happened? 
Our trusted vice commander… I refuse to believe it! If this is a dream, please wake me up… 
Boss… Just… why?! 
How could something like this happen…? 
Ogami… You shouldn't blame yourself. You did nothing wrong. 
Sakura! So this is where you were. 
(This doesn't look good… The morale of the whole Flower Division has hit rock bottom…) 
… 
You've… grown strong. 
No… <br> That may be it. 
No… I… just admired her as my superior, that's all. 
… 
You're right… I was certainly drawn to Ayame. 
Sakura… 
I don't know… 
…… 
When… When I met Ayame she was like a goddess to me. 
She was so kind, so noble… I couldn't help but admire her big heart. 
And that same Ayame, she… she abandoned us… It breaks my heart… 
…Not like me? 
I'm… I'm fine, Sakura! 
…! 
I have faith in Ayame! Her true heart can't be evil. I refuse to believe that! 
Yes! Let's show them what the Flower Division can do as a team, Sakura! 
Sakura… 
…… 
Should we head back? It's freezing here. 
… 
Ah… It even started snowing… 
Ayame… Where are you? Are you watching this snow right now, as I am? 
Maria's room… 
I guess it's about time to go. 
Let's leave her alone for now. 
It's me, Ogami… 
…Can I come in? 
… 
Maria… Aren't you tired? You should rest, too. 
… 
Maria… 
…Thanks for telling me. It… It must have been tough on you, too. 
… 
Maybe I can't do much… but… 
Maria… 
You're… a strong person. 
No… It's OK. 
That's good… 
…What's the matter, Maria? 
Sumire… 
Don't be so down… 
You're not yourself! <br> You should get some rest. 
You really aren't acting like yourself right now! 
Sumire… You should get some rest. 
… 
Sumire… 
Sumire!! 
…Sorry. 
…Yeah. 
Sumire… 
Kohran… 
Kohran…? 
What are you doing here? Are you… crying? 
…Kohran? 
… 
Kohran… 
I'll save her! 
…? 
Ayame is very important to me too. I'll save her, no matter what! 
Really, really! Come on, Kohran, cheer up! 
I'm… I didn't lie… 
Wha…? 
… 
… 
Kohran! 
You know I hate lying, right? Was that really a lie? 
I like you a lot, Kohran. I'd never lie to you… Everything I said is true. 
You don't really believe that, do you? 
You've got a wonderful dream, haven't you? A dream all your own. 
… 
…So there it is, your own special dream. 
…You're always hard at work to make your dream come true. 
You never lose sight of your dream and keep on running towards it. 
… 
When I look at you, for some reason I believe. I believe dreams can come true. 
I'll save Ayame. That's not a lie. I'll save her, no matter what! 
She'll come back to us, just you wait. I'm absolutely certain of that! 
… 
Let's go save her together. And then we'll all be back here safe and sound! 
And after that, we'll get to your dream… We'll soar the skies… 
You'll take me on your first test flight, right? 
Of course you can. I don't doubt it for a second! 
Yes! 
Yes, that would be great. 
Iris… What are you doing here? 
Let's get you back to your room. You'll catch death out here. 
…What did you dream of? 
Huh…? 
Iris… 
Iris…! 
… 
It's fine… It's OK. 
No one here would ever think of leaving you alone. Don't worry. We're all in this together. 
I'll be by your side. Always. So stop worrying and sleep well… 
I'm here for you, Iris. I'll always watch over you. 
Sweet dreams… 
This is Iris' room… 
Let's go somewhere else. 
Let's leave her alone for now. 
Iris… Are you up? 
…Huh? The door isn't locked… 
…Iris? 
Iris…… 
Kanna… 
You can't fight on an empty stomach, right? 
True. 
You're such a strong person. 
That's not true. You always fight with everything you've got. 
You shouldn't talk like that. You of all people, Kanna… 
…That's not true. 
I like you a lot, Kanna. You're always honest, you're stronger than anyone… 
If either of us can't do it alone, let's just do it together, you and me. 
Together, we can achieve just about anything. 
… 
Let's go, all together, and get Ayame back. 
We owe her so much… every single one of us. 
We know Ayame. She wouldn't die so easily… We can still save her, I'm sure of it! 
Yes, whatever it takes! 
…Hm? 
Kanna… 
Kanna… You should get some rest. 
What about you, Boss? Shouldn't you rest, too? 
If you're resting, I'll get some rest too. 
After I eat this… Please… Don't concern yourself with me. 
…Yeah, sorry. I'm off. 
The Pandemonium Regalia is no longer here. Ayame took it and… brought it to Satan. 
(I'm in front of Ayame's room.) 
… 
Ayame… 
(A sliding screen. There's probably a closet behind it.) 
(This room doesn't really feel lived in. I wonder why…) 
(A big mirror. I think this is called a "cheval mirror.") 
(A mirror in a room without much in the way of other furniture… You can tell a woman lives here.) 
(I think there's a glass window behind this paper screen.) 
(There's no one here anymore who would open that window…) 
(There are 3 books lying on the desk. Maybe she wrote something down in one of them?) 
"Imperial Theater, Flower Division, Reporting Journal", "January 1st, 1924", "Kouma War, 1917"… 
(Dressers are often handed down through the generations. Did Ayame receive this one from her mother?) 
(This dresser is looking exactly as before… Only Ayame isn't here anymore.) 
(This crucifix has an overbearing presence in this room. I wonder why…) 
(Ayame had this crucifix in her room, and yet she's with the demons now… I still can't believe it.) 
(Even with Ayame gone, these flowers refuse to wilt away.) 
(As if they're waiting for their owner's return…) 
(A Japanese-style lamp. It's giving off a calming light.) 
(Is this… electrical? Kohran must have given it to her.) 
(A photograph? Let's see…) 
Yoneda and… Ayame? Is this the anti-demon unit? 
The man on the right looks a bit like Sakura. It must be Colonel Shinguji. 
Yoneda looks exactly like he does now. And in the middle, Ayame… Those were happier times for her. 
(A photograph of the anti-demon unit…) 
It looks like Ayame is snuggling up to the man on the left… 
Maybe this is Shinnosuke Yamazaki, who later disappeared? 
Hm, is this…? The man on the left, I think… maybe… I've seen him somewhere before? 
Let's take a look… <br> Let's leave it. 
Kouma War, 1917 <br> Reporting Journal <br> January 1st, 1924 
(I shouldn't just read this without permission…) 
It's dated… seven years ago. 
"Kouma War documents" - Taisho 7 (1918), Imperial Infantry" - "Top secret" 
"Kouma War" is a term used for combat operations against the creatures called "Kouma" that occurred from Taisho 6 to 7. 
About one square mile in the Nihonbashi area was totally destroyed, including all buildings. 
According to internal calculations from the Infantry, damages amount to hundreds of millions of Yen. 
The intelligence bureau's historians found out that evidence of the Kouma existed even in ancient China. 
Kouma are demons that latch onto living beings and feed on their negative emotions. 
Low-level Kouma consist only of a head, but they feed and grow stronger, eventually gaining human appearance. 
The giant monsters witnessed during the Kouma War are presumed to be very large low-level Kouma. 
During the final stage of the Kouma War, an independent unit chased the giant Kouma underground. 
It was known as the "anti-demon unit" and suffered one dead and one MIA. It was dispersed thereafter. 
Commanding officer of this unit was Lieutenant General Ikki Yoneda of the Imperial Infantry. 
The Flower Division… This is about us? 
Fourth of April, fair weather. 
Imperial Navy Lt. Ogami Ichiro will arrive in our Ginza HQ by recommendation of Count Hanakoji. 
Anniversary performance of "Evening of the Camellia Lady" was resounding success. Theater is in a good spot. 
April 5th, fair, then cloudy. 
Reports of Hive of Darkness at Ueno Park. Presumed leader is present. First real test for Flower Division. 
Ensign Ogami's performance deemed "pretty good for his first try" by Yoneda. 
May 12th, a calm Japanese spring day. 
Kohran Li has started in the Ginza HQ. Seems enthusiastic about her work. 
Yoneda gave orders to ready the Soaring Whale. Will head to the Flower Mansion by Thunderstrike. 
May 13th, fair weather. 
Met Ichiro Ogami last night. He was how I imagined him, more or less. Hope he meets our expectations. 
Contact-free piloting system is ready. Iris' Koubu will be ready soon. 
Maiden voyage of the Soaring Whale. Damages to mansion from scrambling impossible to predict. 
June 9th, rain. 
Lt. Ogami wounded in battle of Hex Mech, but nothing serious. Kanna Kirishima back from Okinawa. 
Maria acting strange, seems vexed by something. Have to talk to her ASAP. 
June 9th, rain. 
Sakura wounded in battle of Hex Mech, but nothing serious. Kanna Kirishima back from Okinawa. 
Maria acting strange, seems vexed by something. Have to talk to her ASAP. 
June 13th, rain. 
After Maria's rogue action, Yoneda was summoned before committee of inquiry. 
Count Hanakoji and Mr. Tadayoshi Kanzaki are doing their best to influence military authorities. 
June 14th, fair weather. 
Yoneda returned to Ginza. Refuses to talk about inquiry. 
Says I'm not to tell anyone, including Ogami. Won't begrudge him his drink today. 
Read on. <br> Put the book back. 
July 5th, fair weather. 
Iris is out of control. First division has orders to eliminate her if we can't stop her before sundown. 
If we get through this, we have to take up Iris' training a notch. 
July 6th, fair weather. 
Story of Iris' rampage is all over the newspapers. Yoneda in a foul mood. 
No one is called before committee of inquiry this time. Perhaps pressure from all sides is high enough? 
August 2nd, cloudy. 
Thanks to reports from citizens, we know of Hive of Darkness's plans in advance for the first time. 
Will recommend Lt. Ogami, Sumire and Kanna as investigation team into abandoned Hex Mech mansion. 
August 3rd, cloudy. 
Investigation in Fukagawa is complete. Looks like I sent the right people. Lt. Ogami has proven his worth. 
Maitreya Hosokawa said something about "enemy's plan". Must find out what it means. 
August 29th, fair weather. 
Steam processor has calculated position of Hive of Darkness's HQ. 
Feeling very uneasy the last few days. Hope that nothing bad will happen. 
October 10th, fair weather. 
Last month went by like a storm. At last, the capital’s facilities are functional again. 
Lt. Ogami and Flower Division are busy preparing celebratory performance, "Flaming Touch of the Snake Woman". 
November 23th, fair weather. 
Today marked last performance of "Wings". Various problems arose, but Kohran did well in starring role. 
Kohran dreams of constructing flying machine. Has been gathering parts since time in Flower Mansion. 
December 31st, snow. 
New Year's Eve. The end of an eventful year. 
Lt. Ogami and Flower Divison are listening to "Old Year, New Year" on radio. 
Hope next year will be a good one. 
January 2nd, fair weather. 
My fears became reality: Kouma have appeared. Monsters that were hidden underground. 
"Kouma War". That tragedy must never be repeated. 
…That's the last entry. 
"January 1st, 1924." I wonder what this is… 
January 1st, fair weather. 
Everyone from the Flower Division went out for a shrine visit. I guess I'm the only one who's thinking about him. 
It's six years ago now. Lieutenant General Yoneda, Colonel Shinguji, and… him. 
How long did I search for him? 
How long did I hold out hope he'd return? 
I still can't forget him. How could I? You can't erase your own memories. 
January 2nd, fair weather. 
Cerulean Satan. I can't stop thinking about that man for some reason. Is it because we fought him before? 
No. I met him somewhere else. But when, and where? 
Cerulean Satan, leader of the Kouma. He betrayed the Hive of Darkness and sneers at everything good and right. 
I just don't know. I feel like I'm on the verge of remembering, and then I get a splitting headache. 
I just don't know. 
January 8th, fair weather, then snow. 
We celebrated Sumire's birthday. Surprisingly, she accepted everyone without the usual animosities. 
Sumire seems changed. I'm different now, too, we all are. That's what being alive is like. 
February 2nd, fair weather. 
Horrible headaches. Yoneda is worried about me. I'll rest in the afternoon. 
February 9th, rain. 
I remembered Kanna has a navigator's license, so I'm teaching her how to control the Soaring Whale. 
I'll teach Kohran everything about running the Flower Mansion. So she can take over when I'm gone. 
February 18th, rain. 
When I look at that photo in the evening, I can't stop crying. It was our first and last photo. 
The Imperial anti-demon unit. Everything seemed shiny and new back then. Those days will never return. 
February 22nd, rain. 
I've been having a strange dream. I see myself from outside, and something behind me. What could it be? 
…That's the last entry. 
…Who is it? 
It's me, Ogami. 
Oh, I see. Come in. 
Please look how everyone's doing. 
Lieutenant General… 
So, Ogami… What's the state of the Flower Division? 
Well… 
No matter, you did well. 
… 
Right, I've got something I wanted to ask of you. 
Yes, what is it? 
It's just… I want to write my report… 
But I can't find the report forms. Do you know where they are? 
The… the report forms? 
Yeah, they must be somewhere in that cupboard, but… 
In the cupboard? 
…Hah… 
Pitiful, isn't it? Until now, Ayame did all of that for me… 
…… 
Seems like I am helpless with no woman around, eh? 
Lieutenant General… 
Let me tell you, Ogami… 
… 
Ever since she stood here before me for the first time… 
I've thought of Ayame almost as a daughter. 
Of course I knew we'd eventually part our ways, but… 
Ayame will return to us! I'm sure of it! 
I'll get her myself if I have to! 
…Please excuse me! 
Damn it, Ogami… Don't talk like you've got it all figured out! 
…Ayame. 
The gun Ayame gave to me… 
If anything should happen to me… Please don't hesitate… Use this gun to shoot me! 
Ayame… 
However, no one can truly know what is right. 
What… What should I do? 
No matter the outcome… 
…you should strive to live without regrets. 
No regrets, huh? You were right, Ayame… 
…… 
Can you guess why I gathered you all here? 
The thing we all feared has finally come to pass… 
What's that? In Tokyo Bay…? 
Hmmm… 
On the night of the red moon, when the seal breaks, the sacred land will return with a god-machine of destruction. 
And that god-machine will turn all the lands to ashes with the light of judgment… Thus is written in "Abandon the Gods". 
"Abandon the Gods"…? 
It's a book of prophecies passed down in the noblest families of the capital, along with the Pandemonium Regalia. 
The noblest families? You don't mean… 
Then that is… 
Yes… The Sacred Demon Castle. 
The Sacred Demon Castle… 
"God-machine" must refer to the spirit cannon that has been rumoured since ancient times. 
Spirit cannon? 
Its light rends the skies and dissolves solid land into mist… allegedly. 
It will be just like the war 400 years ago. The fabled sealed land "Yamato" will rise again. 
There's no time to spare! We must hurry to Tokyo Bay and prevent the Sacred Demon Castle from reappearing! 
Yes sir! 
! 
What? 
Come out of that dirty hut, dogs of the capital! 
That… that voice… 
Ayame… 
We can't dawdle any longer… Let's go, everyone! 
There's nothing to do in my room. I should check on the others. 
I wonder if Sakura is in. 
I wonder if Sakura is in. 
She doesn't seem to be here. Must have gone someplace else. 
Who is it…? 
Sakura… It's me, Ogami… 
Ogami… Could you leave me alone for a while? 
…OK, I'll do that. 
Let's try some other place… 
Let's leave her for now. 
I wonder how Kanna is doing. 
I'm in front of Kanna's room… 
She doesn't seem to be here. Where would she be? The canteen, maybe? 
Who is it…? 
Kanna… It's me, Ogami… 
Boss? I'm sorry, but I don't feel like talking right now. 
…OK, got it. 
Let's try some other place… 
But… I guess she just needs her space right now. 
I wonder how Kohran is doing… 
I'm in front of Kohran's room… 
Kohran… She seems to have gone somewhere. 
Who is it…? 
Kohran… Kohran! Are you there? 
Chief? Leave me alone for a while, will ya? 
…All right, got it. 
Let's try some other place… 
I should leave her in peace for now. 
Sumire… 
I'm in front of Sumire's room… 
…No response. Her room seems to be empty. 
Who is it…? 
Sumire… It's me, Ogami… 
Ensign… Please excuse me, but could you give me some time to reflect on my own? 
…All right. 
Let's try some other place… 
Let's leave her for now. 
This auditorium… this whole theater is like a barometer measuring the peace in the capital. Must keep it high. 
Everyone seems to have gone someplace else… 
We have to fill this room with spectators again… That's our most important mission. 
Everyone seems to have gone someplace else… 
No one here… 
Everyone seems to be somewhere else… 
Kasumi and Yuri already went home… 
Everyone seems to be somewhere else… 
This room always feels empty when no one's here, but now, the feeling is overwhelming. 
Everyone seems to have gone someplace else… 
It's too late for Tsubaki to still be here… 
Everyone seems to have gone someplace else… 
After the crowds that came to see "Dinosaur Island", it's eerily quiet here now… 
I should leave. If I stay here any longer, I'll just feel depressed. 
This place can get crowded, but now it's completely deserted. 
I wonder where everyone is… 
What could be sadder than an auditorium without a single spectator? 
I should go somewhere else. 
This place hasn't been used in a while. All the costumes are stuffed away in boxes. 
I should go somewhere else. 
When there's a performance, this place is so busy, but now that's hard to imagine… 
I should go somewhere else. 
No one here, huh? Let's go somewhere else. 
No one here, huh? Let's go somewhere else. 
When there's no performance, this room becomes meaningless. 
Maybe I should try someplace else… 
The Jinbu… With the Pandemonium Regalia, these Spirit Armors are the only thing we can rely on… 
There doesn't seem to be anyone down here. 
You don't see Kanna or Sumire train here anymore… 
There doesn't seem to be anyone down here. 
This place doesn't look like it's been used in some time. 
I should go somewhere else. 
There's no one here… 
Maybe I should try someplace else… 
There's no one here. I should go somewhere else… 
No one's using this place now. 
There's no one here. I should go somewhere else… 
Only the steam processor keeps on working as if nothing happened… 
There doesn't seem to be anyone down here. 
I thought I might find someone here, but looks like I'm out of luck… 
There doesn't seem to be anyone down here. 
There's nobody here. 
Will I really never see Ayame here again? 
I should go somewhere else. 
I'm in front of Maria's room… 
Who is it…? 
Maria… It's me, Ogami… 
I'm sorry, Captain, but please leave me alone for a while. 
…All right. 
I should leave Maria alone for now. 
I'm in front of Iris' room… 
… 
Iris… It's me, Ogami… 
…… 
She must have fallen asleep… 
Let's leave her in peace for now. 
Kohran isn't here anymore… 
I should go somewhere else. 
Sumire isn't here anymore… 
I should go somewhere else. 
Sakura isn't here anymore… 
I should go somewhere else. 
Kanna isn't here anymore… 
I should go somewhere else. 
The stage lays in complete silence… What a dreary sight.

O black rain, o devilish wind, o wicked sea, open the seal for us… Grant us power! 
At last, it will return to this world… the Sacred Demon Castle! 
Hehehe… 
Ensign… 
You think I'm depressed!? Ha! Ridiculous! 
What do I care if one or two women like that die? 
Huh… 
Not myself?! You talk just like them, Ensign! 
Hmph! 
You don't need to worry about me! You talk just like them, Ensign! 
Now excuse me! 
How… How could you say something like that!? 
You… who knows us better than anyone else! 
Every day we must fight! Kill, kill, kill! 
My hands are… already sticky with blood! 
How can you be this calm!? Become like a normal girl!? Be happy the flowers are blooming!? 
Who made me what I am? Wasn't it Ayame!? Certainly not you lot! 
But even though… She just double-crossed us… 
And here I was thinking we were fighting on the same side… If this is supposed to be a joke, it's not funny! 
Call me childish, but I can't see any good in Ayame even if I tried. 
! 
I'm sorry… Captain… Please leave me be for a while… 
Auntie Ayame… 
I've calmed down a bit… 
This is exactly what Satan wanted, isn't it? We should know better than this. 
Unused
Ogami… You liked Ayame, right? 
But… It didn't look like that to me. 
As for me… I liked her a lot. I always strived to become a person just like her. 
Unused
Sorry… I'm sure I don't make sense… 
Unused
That's it! Ayame must simply be under Satan's control! 
We have to save her! The Imperial Floral Assault Troupe wouldn't be the same without her! 
Thank you, Ogami. 
I… I liked her a lot, too. She was a big inspiration. 
I could only dream of becoming like her one day… 
But everything's changed now! I've grown a lot stronger since then. 
Come on, Ogami! Let's save Ayame! 
Ayame must be under Satan's control. I'm sure there's a way to free her. We can't just abandon her! 
Muahahaha…! The castle that will fulfill all my ambitions is about to return. Aya-me! 
Yes. 
It will be some time until the Sacred Demon Castle will be reborn. Distract those girls until the time has come. 
Yes, master! 
Show me what you can do. 
Please wait. 
This Aya-me was sleeping until a short while ago. She might fail. 
You should entrust me, Butterfly, with this task! 
Hmph… Very well. Do as you please… 
Thank you kindly… 
Hehehe… 
Why are you laughing? 
Hehe, it's just… I'm looking forward to a demonstration of your skill. 
I will fulfill my ambition together with Lord Satan… I won't allow you to interfere!

Why? Why you, Ayame… After we've fought together, side by side! 
We can't throw in the towel just yet. This fight is only just beginning! 
But… What are you saying!? This isn't like you at all, Ogami! 
Yes! No matter what happened, you managed to get us through so far! 
Please cheer up! 
Don't give up, Ogami. You're the only one we can rely on right now. 
Hm? Boss…? 
Well, it's true… If we sit here and cry, that won't make Ayame come back, right? 
No worries! I'll bring her back, even if I have to drag her kicking and screaming! 
If I'd just been stronger, then… All of this wouldn't have happened. 
I'm really pathetic… The one thing I'm good at, and still I couldn't do anything. 
You can stop trying to make me feel better, Boss. I've failed, that's a fact. 
I know I'm a big klutz of a woman. My strength was my one redeeming quality. 
So… What are you saying? 
I can't cook, my dancing is lousy… 
I'm pretty sure you'll grow tired of being around me soon enough… 
Huh? 
Cut it out… This isn't like you. 
Yeah… 
Yes… I guess you're right… 
Boss… 
Thank you. 
Having someone to lean on at a time like this… That's priceless. 
To tell you the truth, I felt like I couldn't go on. 
Ayame… that such a thing could happen to her… 
I can't even get any sleep. If I try to, the nightmares are so bad I'm happy when I wake up again. 
There's no one there… 
Sakura… Kasumi… 
Everyone's gone. Just like auntie Ayame… Everyone… 
Mon Frère… You won't leave me, right? Promise you'll never leave me! 
I don't want to be alone! I would die! 
Mon Frère… 
I just… I don't want to be alone… 
Can you promise me, Mon Frère? That you'll never leave me alone? 
That you'll always… be there? 
*sniff* Ah, Chief… 
You know me… I can't do anything right. 
I can't shoot a gun like Maria, and I'm not strong like Kanna. 
*sniff* The only thing I'm even remotely good is tinkering with stuff. 
I never told you this, but… I didn't even go to school. 
But still, Ayame took me in. She took care of me and made sure I got an education here in Japan. 
She was always so good to me… But then… *sniff* 
*sniff* How did it come to this…? 
Can you tell me that, Chief? 
*sniff* Really? 
You're right… Gotta keep smiling! Nothing good's ever come of moping. 
Thanks, Chief. I should head back to my room and get some shut-eye. 
OK, Chief… Good night.

Lies and natto are the two things I can't stand! 
No, no… A lie is better than nothing. I really like you, Chief! 
OK… I should probably head back to my room. 
C-Chief… 
It doesn't matter… 
That… That'd be too much. I can't ask that of you, Chief… 
A no-good gal like me, whose only ability is to kick machines into shape… 
That's… Chief… So you remembered? 
Chief… 
Yeah… 
Chief… 
Of course… If I could fly with you, you can't imagine how much I'd… 
*sniff* It's funny, really… 
Just being here with you like this… I already feel so much better. I wonder why that is… 
Ah… Captain… 
Out of everyone in the Flower Division, I've known Ayame the longest. 
I first met her four years ago in America. 
I was completely lost back then. I was this close to getting into wetwork. 
It was Ayame who saved me… 
Even back then, she was always fighting for others. 
What a sad life… 
Ha… Then again, who am I to say that about her? I should stop talking about that ancient history. 
It was ages ago… Back when I was still only fighting for myself. 
Now it's different… I have friends who fight by my side. 
No… Not at all! 
Captain… No, Ogami… You're always fighting for the Flower Division and the people of this city… 
And I guess… I'm one more weight on your shoulders. 
I'll fight alongside you, for this city. That's all that counts for now. 
Yes, but… 
Please forget what I said… 
Unused
I think I'll follow your advice… I'll rest for a bit. 
Ayame, who always used to guide me… 
Good and evil… I wonder which side of Ayame that was. 
Until now… No, until you were here, Ogami… 
Hehe… Ayame always was the only one I could talk with about these things. 
No, not at all.
