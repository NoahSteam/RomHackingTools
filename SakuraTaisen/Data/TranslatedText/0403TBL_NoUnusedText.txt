It's a photo of Sakura. She's looking right at me. I wonder what she's thinking… 
It's a photo of Sumire. This is a side of her you don't see too often. 
It's a photo of Maria. …She's lost in thought and looks kind of sad… 
It's a photo of Kanna. Kanna's signature strength comes through clearly. 
It's a photo of Iris. She's surrounded by flowers and flashing a radiant smile. 
It's a photo of Kohran. She's looking pretty in profile with her face dyed red by the evening sun. 
A letter given to me by a customer. I was asked to give it to Sumire. I have a bad feeling about this… 
Maria's pistol. This may help me escape from here… 
A hair ornament. It's decorated with flowers and looks very elegant. 
A pretty pendant. The delicate workmanship is gorgeous. 
A hairpin for use in a traditional bun hairstyle. It would complement a formal outfit well. 
Jean-Paul the teddy bear. Iris's best friend. She always carries him with her and takes good care of him. 
This key will let me enter rooms I couldn't before. 
I found this in a bedroom on the second floor. I can use it to access the back room. 
A teacup Iris asked me to get for her. It has a very stylish design. 
This is the matchbox Iris asked for. Its logo is quite colorful. 
A knife Iris asked me to get for her. Just a normal utensil you'd use during a meal. 
A prop sword and shield used onstage. They're well made and look just like the real thing. 
A prop crown used onstage. It's well-constructed and incredibly detailed. 
A wig and costume used onstage. I wonder what kind of act could use a flashy outfit like this? 
It's a photo of Sakura in her swimsuit. Wow, this is really something. I'm gonna treasure this. 
It's a photo of Sumire in her stage costume. Her distinctive makeup really makes an impact. 
It's a photo of Maria on stage in the uniform from "For Love"… a beautiful woman disguised as a man. 
It's a photo of Kanna in her training gear. Catching her in a private moment like this feels surprisingly intimate. 
It's a photo of Iris in her swimsuit. She's holding a rubber ring and looks ready to have some fun. How cute. 
It's a photo of Kohran. I don't get to see her with her braids undone very often. It's a nice look. 
It's a photo of Ayame in a traditional outfit. I hope she'll always be as happy and content as she is here. 
Ayame's gun. Why…? Why did it have to turn out like this…? 
… 
…… 
… 
What… you don't remember anything!? 
W, well… good. That's good… 
Phew… ha… hahaha…

… ahaha… hehehe… 
Hey, Iris… can I ask you something? 
Huh!? 
When you jumped to Ogami… did you feel anything? 
Iris. 
Unused
The captain's calling for ya. 
Okay! 
You look happy. 
Unused
We get to do our date over again! See ya! 
Oh, about what you asked. When I jumped to him… 
I felt something really warm. And… 
And? 
The rest is a se~cret! Bye-bye! 
For heaven's sake, to think they'd do this to a beautiful, refined lady like myself… 
*Sigh* Leaving all this cleaning… I can't believe them. Did they forget whose fault this was? 
Nnngh… nnnnnh…! 
*Gasp*…! 
Huh? Where am I!? What happened? 
…I remember I was crying in my room… 
But I feel like all those bad feelings have gone away. I feel all better. 
Huh? What's the matter, Uncle? Huh? Huh? You're being weird.
