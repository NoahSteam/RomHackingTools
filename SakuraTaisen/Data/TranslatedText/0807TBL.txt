It's a photo of Sakura. She's looking right at me. I wonder what she's thinking…
It's a photo of Sumire. This is a side of her you don't see too often.
It's a photo of Maria. …She's lost in thought and looks kind of sad…
A photo of Kanna. Kanna's signature strength comes through clearly.
A photo of Iris. She's surrounded by flowers and flashing a radiant smile.
A photo of Kohran. She's looking pretty in profile with her face dyed red by the evening sun.
A letter given to me by a patron. I was asked to give it to Sumire. I have a bad feeling about this…
Maria's pistol. This may help me escape from here…
A hair ornament. It's decorated with flowers and looks very elegant.
A pretty pendant. The delicate workmanship is gorgeous.
A hairpin for use in a traditional bun hairstyle. It would complement a formal outfit well.
This key will let me enter rooms I couldn't before.
I found this in a bedroom on the second floor. I can use it to access the back room.
A teacup Iris asked me to get for her. It has a very stylish design.
This is the matchbox Iris asked for. Its logo is quite colorful.
A knife Iris asked me to get for her. Just a normal utensil you'd use during a meal.
A prop sword and shield used onstage. They're well-made and look just like the real thing.
A prop crown used onstage. It's well-constructed and incredibly detailed.
A wig and costume used onstage. I wonder what kind of act could use a flashy outfit like this?
A photo of Sakura in her swimsuit. Wow, this is really something. I'm gonna treasure this.
A photo of Sumire in her stage costume. Her distinctive makeup really makes an impact.
It's a photo of Maria on stage in the military uniform from "For Love"… She's a beautiful woman disguised as a man.
A photo of Kanna in her training gear. Catching her in a private moment like this feels surprisingly intimate.
A photo of Iris in her swimsuit. She's holding a rubber ring and looks ready to have some fun. How cute.
A photo of Kohran. I don't get to see her with her braids undone very often. It's a nice look.
A photo of Ayame in a traditional outfit. I hope she'll always be as happy and content as she is here.
Ayame's gun. Why…? Why did it have to turn out like this…?
Jean-Paul the teddy bear. Iris's best friend. She always carries him with her and takes good care of him.

I'll do my best to make it a great year! And, er…
No! It's nothing!
You were always there for me last year. Thank you for everything!
Sakura! I didn't expect such a well-mannered greeting from you!
Thank you. I'll try hard this year to be a proper lady like you, Sumire!
Ohohohoho… Seems like you have finally seen the light!
Hmph… I was planning to make it from Nishijin brocade imported from Kyoto…

Commander… Happy New Year.
Yo, boss! Chinese New Year is still some weeks off though…
You look much older already!
Happy New Year, uncle Ichi!
I'll be eleven this year! How long do you think until I can get married?
Oh, really?
You've come a long way as a commander! I have a feeling we've got an awesome year ahead of us.
Like you would know anything about that…
How dare you, you evil hag!
Stop your screaming, gorilla!
Want to pick a fight, you rotten snake?
Ogami… You did well last year. Keep it up!
Boss… You're acting blushy all day!

You and me, let's get out of here and enjoy our shrine visit together.
That makes me happy! Let's get out of here right away.
Just kidding! Hohohoho… How innocent you are!
Untranslated
All right, just what I wanted to hear! Let's get out of here!
Hahaha! All right, let's drink and be merry! Right?
I really like you, boss. Come on then, show me how you celebrate New Year's day in Tokyo. Just the two of us!
This is our little secret… OK, let's go!
Untranslated
Untranslated
Hey, uncle Ichi… Take me to the shrine please!
Just the two of us, having fun. Hihihi… Wouldn't that be nice?
Yaaay, I'm so happy! Let's leave right now!
Untranslated
Booooohoooooo!

Yay! A date with uncle Ichi!
Hihi… Normally my servants would drive me there.
That's beneath me.

Sorry you had to wait!

I wanted to dress in a real Japanese kimono. New Year's day only comes once a year, after all!
And also… It's my first date with you, Mr. Ogami.
Even if you're only flattering me, that makes me happy.
Thank you, really.
Ah! The train's here! Let's get on!
What a crowd! So this is what New Year's day is like in Tokyo!
I'm so glad Tokyo is finally at peace…
OK… Let's go too then!
What a crowd…
Of course…

So many people in one place… These commoners all behave like faceless drones.
If you want to make commoners like you, you have to do as they do.
I hope you appreciate my efforts.
Come on, commander! Let's go.
Quickly!
Oh, not bad! Very festive.
Oh, stop it… You really went all out there.
You're a great guy.
Hey… Do you have to talk shop when it's just the two of us?
But… that's just what I like about you.
Come one, let's go.
So… this is what you do on New Year's day? Not really what I imagined.
Hmmm, it seems to unmotivated, lonely…
Oh, let's light some firecrackers! Then we'll get in the mood!
Really? How boring…
Right. Wanna go on?
Whoaaa… So many people! Don't you think, uncle Ichi?
Hey, hey, hey… What's that real big house over there?
Come on, uncle Ichi!
Let's go already!
I'm not telling.
Let's go then.
Ohohoho… That's a secret.
Should we get going?
Nah, it's nothing…
Wanna get going?
No, it's nothing.
Let's go somewhere else, uncle Ichi!
Not telling!
Step right up, step right up! We've got a monkey straight from China!
How about it? Wanna give it a go, sir?
Let's try it, Mr. Ogami!
Hmph… A childish diversion.
Commander! Let's try that!
Untranslated
Hey, uncle. I wanna try!

Not bad at all!
I'm impressed, boss!
You're so awesome, uncle Ichi!

Please come here, Mr. Ogami.
Come here for a moment.
Really, commander… Why did you have to take me to such an out of the way place?
Oh, you don't need to blush. There's no one around who could see us.
Oh, commander! And Sumire, too…
Sakura…
Untranslated
Heya, Sakura! Fancy running into you here!
Wh… Why are you all here?
Untranslated
That's right! Isn't it nice for all of the Flower Division to celebrate New Year together?
Exactly. We wanted to have fun together.
That was fun! Something like this isn't bad once in a while. A bit like a date.
What? What what what? What's with that artificial laugh?
So being with me really isn't enough…?
Oh, commander! And Kanna, too.
S-Sakura!?
Untranslated
Untranslated
Wh-wh-why is everyone here all of a sudden!?
Come on, boss… Where else would we go on New Year's day but the shrine?
That's right! Isn't it nice for all of the Flower Division to celebrate New Year together?
Well… That's it, really.
Phew… There's a bunch of people everywhere. Really makes me tired.
Thanks. Tell me one thing, boss…
Are you happy you visited the shrine with me?n
Really? Makes me happy to hear you say so, boss!
Oh, commander! And Kohran, too.
S-Sakura!?
Untranslated
Oooh, there's Sakura! Yoohoo!
Why's everyone here all of a sudden!?
Ohohoho… Where else would we go on New Year's day but the shrine?
Didn't we agree on celebrating New Year together?
Not really…
That's right! Isn't it nice for all of the Flower Division to celebrate New Year together?
That's it!
Tell me, uncle Ichi… What do you think of me?
Do you… like me?
Hihihi… I love you too, uncle!
Aww, come on! If you wanna confess your love, you have to be serious!
Oh, commander! And Iris, too.
Ah… Sakura!
So you really wanted to visit the shrine with everyone, Mr. Ogami?
Sakura! What are the odds?
Why's everyone here?
Come on, boss… Where else would we go on New Year's day but the shrine?
Just get crazy for once!
That's right! Isn't it nice for all of the Flower Division to celebrate New Year together?
Oh, look… A manifestation of the North Star Buddha!
I have to pay my respects, as a user of the North Star Fencing style.
Daaaaaaaa!
Whoa…
Untranslated
We just followed you!
We can't let you have all the fun!
Ohohohoho…
Don't surprise me like that! You just wanted to give me scare!
Let's all visit the shrine together!
That's right! Isn't it nice for all of the Flower Division to celebrate New Year together?
Right on! That's what I like about you!
It feels like we're being watched…
Hahahaha…!
That voice…
Over there!
So we meet again, my friends of the Imperial Floral Storm Troop!
My name is Aoi Satan!
The Black Web…? Don't make me laugh.
That Tenkai's finished for good. After all, he was nothing more than the shogunate's lap dog.
But I, Aoi Satan, am of a different breed! I'll never give up!
Your precious peace won't continue forever. Pray all you want!
A ridiculous man like you, so easily bewitched by the charms of women…
You'll never stop me.
I'll level this city for good. All humans will cower before me!
What I want? Hehehehe…
