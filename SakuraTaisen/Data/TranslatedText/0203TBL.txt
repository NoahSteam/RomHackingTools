It's a photo of Sakura. She's looking right at me. I wonder what she's thinking…
It's a photo of Sumire. This is a side of her you don't see too often.
It's a photo of Maria. …She's lost in thought and looks kind of sad…
A photo of Kanna. She looks strong and reliable. I can't wait to meet her.
A photo of Iris. She's surrounded by flowers and flashing a radiant smile.
A photo of Kohran. She's looking pretty in profile with her face dyed red by the evening sun.
A letter given to me by a customer. I was asked to give it to Sumire. I have a bad feeling about this…
Maria's pistol. This may help me escape from here…
A hair ornament. It's decorated with flowers and looks very elegant.
A pretty pendant. The delicate workmanship is gorgeous.
A hairpin for use in a traditional bun hairstyle. It would complement a formal outfit well.
This key will allow me to enter rooms I couldn't get into before.
I found this in a bedroom on the second floor. I can use it to access the back room.
A teacup Iris asked me to get for her. It has a very stylish design.
A matchbox Iris asked me to get for her. The brand logo is very colorful.
A knife Iris asked me to get for her. Just a normal utensil you'd use during a meal.
A prop sword and shield used onstage. They're well made and look just like the real thing.
A prop crown used onstage. It's well constructed and incredibly detailed.
A wig and costume used onstage. I wonder what kind of act could use a flashy outfit like this?
A photo of Sakura in her swimsuit. Wow, this is really something. I'm gonna treasure this.
A photo of Sumire in her stage costume. Her distinctive makeup really makes an impact.
It's a photo of Maria on stage in the military uniform from "For Love"… She's a beautiful woman disguised as a man.
A photo of Kanna in her training gear. Catching her in a private moment like this feels surprisingly intimate.
A photo of Iris in her swimsuit. She's holding a rubber ring and looks ready to have some fun. How cute.
A photo of Kohran. I don't get to see her with her braids undone very often. It's a nice look.
A photo of Ayame in a traditional outfit. I hope she'll always be as happy and content as she is here.
Ayame's gun. Why…? Why did it have to turn out like this…?
Jean-Paul the teddy bear. Iris's best friend. She always carries him with her and takes good care of him.
Is it this late already…? Soon it'll be time to put the theatre's lights out.
I only have time to inspect about 3 more rooms… What should I do?
Untranslated
I guess I'll keep going a little longer.
It's been a long day… I think I'll go back to my room and sleep.
It's almost time to put the theatre's lights out. My watch is about finished.
Phew… It's been a long day. I think I'll go back to my room and try to get some sleep.
I'd like to find a book to borrow some time, but I'm on patrol right now. Better leave it for later.
OK, looks like all is good here. I'll go check out another room.
I wonder if Sakura's in there?
Doesn't matter if she is. I have to continue my patrol.
…No answer. Is she asleep already?
…The room is empty. I have a feeling that another member of the Flower Division stays here…
No point in loafing around in a place like this. I'd better continue my patrol.
…No answer. Well, of course not--it's an empty room.
I wonder if Maria's in her room?
Maria… might be asleep. Guess I'll go to another room.
…No answer, huh?
I wonder if Kohran's in there?
I'm still on patrol, so why don't I check out another room?
…Looks like she's not here. Oh well. Moving on?
There's no way Iris could still be awake now, right?
OK then. I'll get back to my patrol. Can't go wasting time.
…She's not answering. Probably already asleep.
I wonder if Sumire's in her room?
Nothing to be done here. I should try and get back to my patrol.
…Who is it?
It's uhh… Ogami.
…I'm in bed already. My apologies, but if there's something you need, please leave it until tomorrow.
It's uhh… Ogami.
Sir, if you need something please leave it until tomorrow, OK?
…I know the owner of every room, except this one.
It's a waste of time to stay here any longer. I'd better continue my patrol.
Like I thought, it looks like no one's in here.
Nobody's in here. I mean, you wouldn't expect anyone to be up drinking tea at this hour anyway.
…Oh well. I guess I'll continue my patrol.
Ginza at night… Such a beautiful view…
…I let myself get distracted. I guess I'll continue my patrol.
Heeey!! Anyone in heeere??
…I really am in a theatre. My voice travels so well.
Everything seems fine here. I'll continue my patrol.
This is the entrance hall. It's amazing how quiet it is compared to the daytime.
…Everything seems fine here. I'll check out another room.
Aah, a futon on a tatami mat. Maybe I could sleep here…
…But I definitely shouldn't. …Guess I'll continue my patrol.
The director's office. Looks like Manager Yoneda… isn't here.
The door is locked, and everything seems fine. Let's continue the patrol.
…Manager Yoneda's probably getting hammered again.
Nobody's in here. I have to be careful, this is where we keep the company books and papers.
…Nothing out of the ordinary. Guess I'll continue my patrol.
Sakura and Maria's costumes have been left here…
…Everything seems fine here. Why don't I go to another room?
These must be to use on stage… The makeup smells nice.
…Everything seems fine here. I'll go to another room.
But… what an amazing number of props.
I don't even know if there IS anyone who can tell which of these props are kept where.
Anyway, everything seems fine here. I'll continue my patrol.
…The stage backdrops and supports have been left in here.
…There's no one around. Well, it's unlikely that anyone would steal this stuff. I'll go to another room.
Everything looks fine. …Only mice would try to break in to here I think.
I guess I'll continue the patrol. I only have so much time after all.
The cafeteria is bustling during the day, but it's dead quiet now.
There's no one here, and no point in sticking around any longer.
The merchandise is still where it was during the daytime. …That's pretty careless.
I'd like to take just one photo… But that would be a terrible thing to do.
Anyway, no problem here. I guess I'll continue my patrol.
I've spent more time than I care to remember cutting tickets in this place.
Now, why don't I continue my work as night watchman?
Is the entrance locked? …Check. It's securely fastened.
I don't see any other problems. I'll continue my patrol.
Aah… I missed seeing Kohran's first play today.
I'll make sure to go see it tomorrow.
Anyway, everything seems fine here. I'll go check out another room.
Is this… a warehouse? There's a bunch of stuff in here.
Anyway, everything seems fine.
I tried to check out the Training room… but nobody's in there.
…Everything seems fine here. I guess I'll continue my patrol.
I can't believe there's a pool like this under the theatre… This place really is amazing.
…Everything seems fine here. I guess I'll continue my patrol.
This is the hangar where the Koubu are kept.
The Koubu have to be ready for action at all times, so they're left on standby. …Nothing out of place here.
This is where we change before using the training room, pool, and showers.
My locker is the third from the right. OK, no problems here. I'll continue my patrol.
I've heard these showers use water heated by a steam machine in the Imperial Theatre's basement.
I'd like to take a nice long shower… but I'm on duty right now.
It figures the Imperial Assault Force would have such advanced medical equipment.
That said, I hope we won't be needing this room too much.
…Everything looks fine here, I'll continue my patrol.
This is the command room, the center of the Imperial Assault Force. When the alarm sounds, we all assemble here.
…No problems here. OK, I'll go to another room.
A steam calculator…
I've heard there are only a few of this size in Japan.
…If anything is wrong with this thing, I sure can't tell. Might as well head for another room.
This is the room where we hold strategy meetings.
Anyway, no problems here. I'll continue my patrol.
Phew… I don't mind doing it, but this job sure isn't easy…
There's no way I can finish by myself… I guess I'll just do as much as I can.
Ogami…
Huh? Sakura… What are you doing up so late?
I'm so sorry Ogami. It's my fault that this happened…
Hey, don't worry about it. It was bound to happen sooner or later.
Hey, would… Would you let me help too?
I could use the help. <br> I can manage by myself, don't worry about it.
Sure, I could use the help. Would you help me fix the set the two of us broke?
Of course!
That's really nice of you but… I can manage by myself.
I see…
In that case… I'm going to go to bed. Sorry again, Ogami…
S-Sakura! …Maybe I should have asked her to help?
…Oh well, I guess I'll carry on the repairs.
Ogami, it's my fault that the stage broke. Please, let me help!
…I understand. Alright then, would you help me fix the set the two of us broke?
Of course!
W-wow… That being said, I wonder how I could have been so clumsy.
You know, I'm really jealous of people as responsible and put-together as you and Maria.
Thanks. <br> I'm not that responsible.
Thanks. <br> I'm not that responsible. <br> I saw you when you were rehearsing.
Thanks… But I'm definitely not as responsible as Maria.
But… people can depend on you.
Thanks, Sakura. Even if you're just flattering me, I'm glad.
It wasn't… I wasn't flattering you.
I'm not that responsible. I can be pretty clumsy myself you know.
Really? But… that's good. I feel kind of relieved actually.
…Sorry Ogami, that came out pretty weird. I'll stop distracting you now.
…But Sakura, you're pretty hardworking too, right?
I saw you the other day, when you were rehearsing by yourself.
What?! W-When did you see that?
Last night. You were practising your dancing here, right?
Y-Yeah… My dancing's pretty bad, so…
I feel like I have to work harder than everyone else.
But I'm actually… kind of glad you were watching me.
By the way. didn't Kohran say that Hanayashiki Branch is usually an amusement park?
I think so, yeah…
Head office is a theatre, and the branch office is an amusement park. Haha, it's kind of funny isn't it?
Hahaha, yeah you're right…
(…I wonder if the Captain of the Hanayashiki Branch works as the ticket-seller as well?)
I wonder what it's like there? <br> We should go see it together. <br> Apparently they have a workshop there.
Hanayashiki Branch huh… I wonder what it's like?
I'd like to know too. I heard that the Hanayashiki Branch Manager is the Deputy Commander of the Imperial Assault Force.
Huh… the Deputy Commander? I wonder what they're like?
I'm not too sure either. Maybe they're an even bigger drinker than Mr. Yoneda.
When it comes to the Imperial Combat Revue… that's actually pretty likely. Let's hope not though.
Hahaha, yeah let's hope not.
An amusement park huh… We should go see it together.
Ogami… you're such a joker.
I'm not joking! If we go back through Asakusa…
Yeah! We can eat monjayaki, buy some fresh rice crackers for the others…
You don't… think about much except eating, do you?
What's wrong with that? Eating and walking around Asakusa is bound to be a lot of fun, right?
I heard from Kohran, apparently they have a Combat Revue Workshop at the Hanayashiki Branch.
Yeah. Kohran worked there, apparently.
Speaking of which, Ogami. I heard something from Kohran too…
She said that there's something really amazing hidden underground at the Hanayashiki Branch.
Really…? What could it be? Something amazing, huh…
Well… Kohran didn't tell me anything else apart from that.
…Sorry Ogami. I've been talking so much, I'm really putting us behind on our work.
Oh! Ogami, you're still gonna be working for a while… right?
…Huh? …Uhh, yeah sure.
Wait here a minute, would you? I'll be right back.
H-Hey, Sakura! …She's gone.
…Oh well. I guess I'll carry on the repairs.
…Y-Yeah. I-It's stopped hurting.
O-of course….
She's so…pretty.
Wh…who could she be? …That girl.
Aghhh!!! W-Who's there? Somebody pinched my back!
Ahhh!! Sakura! H-How long have you been standing there!?
N…no, that was…
I-It wasn't… She wasn't my girlf…
Huh? Sakura!? Wait a second!
Ah… She's gone.
…Huh? This is…
Whoah! A bento box… It's so well-made as well.
Could this… Did she make this for me?
Untranslated
Phew, I'm kinda tired. I guess I'll head back to my room.
I'm going to Sakura's room. It's not fair on her to leave things like this.
…No choice. Guess I'll keep working.
Phew… It's no good. I can't focus on work right now.
What happened with that girl just now, I can't get it out of my head…
…*sigh* That girl… who was she I wonder?
…Right, here we are. Sakura… I wonder if she's in?
Hmm… Then again it's pretty late. What should I do…?
Untranslated
No good. If I don't explain things now then…
Actually let's leave it for tomorrow… Guess I'll go back to my room.
Yes…? Who's there?
I'm a fan. Can I get your autograph? <br> It's Ogami…
I'm one of your fans. Can I have an autograph?
That voice… Ogami is that you? Stop making fun of me!
I'm already in bed!
H-Hey, Sakura!
…
…Ahh, I made her mad.
No choice. I guess I'll head back for tonight.
It's Ogami…
…
Sakura… a-about before, I'm really…
… Before all that, why don't you come in?
… Excuse me.
… Who's there? I'll scream!
D-damn! No choice. I'm heading back!
So, this is my first time in Sakura's room huh…
Anyway, was there something you wanted?
…It's cute, like a little girl's bed.
Really? I'm embarrassed, please don't look at it like that…
I'm gonna turn in.
H-Hold on Ogami! You can't just get into someone's bed without their permission!?
Ogami! If there's nothing you wanted, please go back to your room. I'm about to go to bed.
Hey, w-wait a minute!
Sakura! Listen to me!
I said I don't know!
Uh oh… I guess I messed with her too much…
…No choice. Guess I'll head back to my room and try and get some sleep.
It… looks like a picture of a castle.
That's a picture of the castle in Sendai, my hometown. It's called Aoba Castle.
Ogami. Do you really think a picture of a castle is all that strange?
Who's this photo of…?
That's…a picture of my family.
That's a picture of my family. We took it together at a photo studio in Sendai.
You were wearing a plait during the day right…? You looked, kind of cute.
…Is that so?
(Sakura… she still looks mad)
Ogami. It's getting really late, hurry up and tell me what you wanted.
(…She still looks mad)
(…She still looks mad)
Sakura, thanks for helping me out before. You didn't get your clothes dirty did you?
No they're fine. How about you, is your finger OK?
Oh, it's fine isn't it? After all, that pretty girl fixed it right up.
(…Uh-oh. She's still mad.)
Ogami. It's getting really late, hurry up and tell me what you wanted.
W-well…
…What is it?
…Thanks, for the bento. <br> Why don't we do some more work? <br> Who was that girl from before?
…Thanks, for the bento. That's all I wanted to say.
And sorry for… asking you to make it for me.
Ogami…
I'm really sorry. I was being stubborn…
Anyway… I wonder who that girl was?
…
Ah, n-nevermind. W-well, I'm gonna head back.
So… Goodnight.
…We did good work today. Goodnight, Ogami.
…Well, I guess I'l get back to my room and try to get some sleep.
If you're up to it, why don't we get some more work done?
…I'm really sorry. I'm… not really feeling up to it. Can we carry on tomorrow?
Oh right… I guess that'll have to do then.
Well then, see you tomorrow… Good night, Sakura.
…Good night.
…No choice. I guess I'll head to bed too.
I wonder who that girl was from before? Sakura, do you know?
…Ogami! That's all you came here to ask me about!?
Oh, no, I mean…
I don't know! Ask someone else, would you?
I'm going to bed! Please leave, Ogami!!
Hey, w-wait a minute!
Sakura! Listen to me!
I said I don't know!
Ugh… I shouldn't have asked that.
…Oh well. I guess I'll head back and try to get some sleep.
Hey, Ogami. I was about to go to bed so…
If there's something you need, you can ask me tomorrow, right?
…Right. Ok, see you tomorrow then… Good night, Sakura.
…Good night.
…No choice. Guess I'll head to bed too.
Phew… Today was a hard day. Let's get some sleep.
But even so… That girl… Who was she I wonder?
…I should have some good dreams tonight.
9.00… Nearly time to start my patrol.
…There's a hammering noise coming from the stage.
…Is someone fixing it?
If so… who on earth could it be?
…I guess I'll go check out the stage.
Huh? What's making that noise?
…I can hear it coming from the stage. …Sounds like a hammer.
Maybe someone's repairing the stage? At this hour… who could it be?
That sound… I can hear it coming from the stage, I wonder what it is…
Who on earth is fixing the stage?
Who could be fixing the stage this late at night?
Huh? That noise, what could it be?
…I can hear it coming from the stage. …Sounds like a hammer.
Is someone repairing the stage? At this hour… who could it be?
Huh? Isn't that Kohran?
Kohran… Are you fixing the stage by yourself?
Hahaha… There's no way I could fix everything just by myself right?
I was just fixing the stuff that I'm good at, like the wiring, the lights and stuff, you know?
This late at night and all by yourself… Amazing, Kohran…
I'm just doing it cuz I enjoy it. No need to gush that much!
…Check it out Ogami. The wiring's pretty much fixed, so I'll leave the rest up to you, kay?
…Wha-?
Ogami. I know ya don't feel like it, but sometimes ya gotta be patient.
The guy who works hardest when nobody else is watching… That's the captain's role, right?
So I'm leaving it up to you from now on. Ogami, you got this.
The captain's role, huh… You've got me there, Kohran.
I guess I'll do some repairs like she said, even if it's just for a little while.
Sakura, did you finish the bento?
Not yet. Ogami, don't rush me!
Oh, Sakura… You're cooking this late?
Yup! Tomorrow, everyone's repairing the stage right?
So I'm making everyone their own bento to eat.
Wow… This tamagoyaki looks really good.
No touching! I've made you your own one already.
Really…? I can't wait for tomorrow.
Anyway, I'm in the middle of my patrol so… Do your best, Sakura.
Thank you. You too Ogami, good luck with the patrol.
Is Iris already asleep?
…I should be getting back to the patrol.
Iris, it's Ogami…
Zzzz…
Already asleep, huh… It'd be a shame to wake her up, I'll just leave quietly.
I wonder if Maria's still up?
Guess I'll get back to my patrol.
It's Ogami… Maria, are you there?
Sir, thank you for your hard work patrolling.
I'm reading at the moment so… Please forgive me for not inviting you in.
(A bit harsh… especially since I came all this way)
Ahem! It's Ogami…
…I'm fairly sure I just told you that I'm in the middle of reading…
In any case, should you really be loafing around in a place like this in the middle of your patrol?
S-sorry.
(Looks like I made her mad… No choice, time to go)
I wonder… Is Sumire still up?
I should get going. No point staying in the same place forever.
It's Ogami… Sumire, are you up?
Oh, sir. The night patrol, is it? Thanks for doing it for us.
I feel bad since you came all this way… but I'm already in bed.
It's not good for my beauty sleep to stay up too late. If there's anything you need, would you inquire about it tomorrow?
(I see… I kind of wanted to talk to her though)
It's me…
Sir. If there's something you need, would you save it until tomorrow?
Of, of course.
Aahh!!
…Oww…
I'm f…fine…
Oh…!
I'm f-fine! I…It's just a little scrape after all.
…
…Y-Yeah. I-It's stopped hurting.
Oh… of course.
Sh…she's so pretty… That girl… who could she be?
S…Sakura!
W-what… When you say it like that, you sound like somebody's wife.
Ah…no, I mean…
H-hey… Sakura?
…She's gone. There's nothing for it. Guess I'll head back to my room as well.
Come forth, Four Lords of Death…!
We are gathered here before you…
How may we be of service?
What was the meaning of that debacle, you imbeciles?!
Well, a mysterious group called the Imperial Combat Revue thwarted our plans…
I do not want excuses!
Our apologies, Master Tenkai…
The fact is they are quite skilled…
Silence, Satan! We are supposed to be invincible!
I've devised a way to destroy the barrier around Teito! …A spell called the "Six Fallen Stars."
Complete this spell and destroy all of Teito! Your first target shall be Shiba Park!
Ha~!
Wait! This time I shall come along. I'm sure you would like to watch me fight.
Don't you agree, Satan?
Of course…
Hmph! Your days are numbered, you old fool…
Eeeeeek!!
Cough, cough…Um…This is the Imperial Theater, right?
Cough…Awww…My steambike is totaled…
The name's Kohran Li. Starting today, I've transferred from the Imperial Assault Garden Branch to Ginza Headquarters.
Yoneda! Yoneda, where are you?!
No sweat! I'll go by myself!
Augh! My face is up here, yanno!
The steam bike I invented boasts 4 cylinders and 5 valves! It runs at 100 horsepower and 200 km per hour!
Does that sound like a mess to you?! You better watch yourself, buddy…
Or I'm gonna knock your block off!
As long as you get it, we're cool! I'm Kohran Li, scientific genius.
I'll be living here from now on. Nice to meetcha!
Anyways, who are you?
Ho, I guess that makes you my boss…
I humbly introduce myself as Kohran Li, just transferred from the Garden Branch to Ginza Headquarters!
Please direct me to Lieutenant General Yoneda, sir!
Much obliged, Ensign Ogami…
No sweat! I'll find him myself!
Are you a Koubu pilot, too?
They're complex machines, and typically only girls have the spiritual energy to pilot them.
It's rare to see a guy pilot one. You must be a real hot shot!
By the way, the Hive of Darkness is made up of remnants of the Tokugawa regime who wanna overthrow the government.
We've got to stop them.
Come in!
Welcome to our shop. Good morning! What can I do for you?
How do you do? I'm Tsubaki Takamura. It's a pleasure to meet you, Ogami!
Ah, Ogami, welcome! What can I do for you?
I hope I was able to be of service. Thank you very much for coming by!
Andre, my love! Please…run away with me.
Were I to abandon my duty and men to run away with you… I would be a different man.
Would you still love me then?
Oh, Andre!
Grrrr! Arrrrgh!
Hello there. You're Ogami, right? I'm Yuri Sakakibara!
I do the theater's office work. I'm looking forward to working with you!
Oh my, did you come by to see me? Hee hee, only teasing you!
Do you need me for anything?
I hope I was able to be of service.
It's nice to meet you, Ogami. I'm Kasumi Fujii.
I'm the theater's office work manager.
Do you need something?
Good work today.
Look, it's still swollen. Let me give it a lick for you one more time.
No need to be embarrassed!
How is it…?
Doing your best is all well and good but take it easy OK…?
Wow, looks like you were having heaps of fun, huh?
Lucky you, she almost looked like your girlfriend.
Is that so… Well then…
Hey now… Are you OK?
Ok you say… But you're bleeding aren't you? Let me take a look.
She's so…pretty. That girl… I wonder who she is. …*sigh*.
Ogling and fawning over girls is really disrespectful you know…
Hey, that's so rude! Since when did I act like your wife!?
You're the worst!
She's so… pretty. That girl… I wonder who she is. …*sigh*.
Ogling and fawning over girls is really disrespectful you know…
Hey, that's so rude! Since when did I act like your wife!?
You're the worst!
Thank you for your hard work.
This is the Deputy Commander of the Imperial Assault Force, and chief of the Hanayashiki Branch.
I'm Ayame Fujieda. I'm pleased to meet you, Ogami.
A captain must be able to make judgments in an instant. I have high hopes for you. Good luck.
Ahhh…
Cursed Imperial Assault Force! Defiant to the last I see!
In that case, I, Tenkai, shall show you the meaning of true terror!!
Lords of Death!!
Annihilate Teito!! Destroy… the Imperial Assault Force!!
Destroy! Destroy! Destroy!
How is it…?
Doing your best is all well and good but take it easy OK…?
No worries! I always carry a repair kit with me just in case!
I'll have it fixed in a jiffy!
By the way, Ensign. You went up against the Hive of Darkness, right?
How'd it feel?
Heh! You've got guts! I like that.
Don't get too cocky, though. We don't know what'll happen next.
Really? I appreciate your honesty, Ensign. Most people couldn't admit that.
And now that I'm here, you've got nothing to worry about! I'll protect you!
Er, you don't have to talk about it if you don't want to.
After all, everybody's gone through stuff they'd rather forget!
Say no more, say no more.
Just give it all you've got next time, Ensign!
I-is that my photo?! Gee, how embarrassing!
Um, Ensign? I want to go to the Manager's Office…
I'll be on this stage very soon…
Are you sure about this, Ensign?
A captain must be able to make judgments in an instant. I have high hopes for you. Do your best Ogami.
Do your best, Ogami.
Eyaaaah!!
S-sir!!
Welcome to our shop. Good morning! What can I do for you?
Ah, Ogami, welcome! What can I do for you?
