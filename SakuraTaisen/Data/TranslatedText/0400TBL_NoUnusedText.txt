It's a photo of Sakura. She's looking right at me. I wonder what she's thinking…  
It's a photo of Sumire. This is a side of her you don't see too often. 
It's a photo of Maria. …She's lost in thought and looks kind of sad…
A photo of Kanna. Kanna's signature strength comes through clearly. 
A photo of Iris. She's surrounded by flowers and flashing a radiant smile. 
A photo of Kohran. She's looking pretty in profile with her face dyed red by the evening sun. 
A letter given to me by a patron. I was asked to give it to Sumire. I have a bad feeling about this…
Maria's pistol. This may help me escape from here…
A hair ornament. It's decorated with flowers and looks very elegant. 
A pretty pendant. The delicate workmanship is gorgeous. 
A hairpin for use in a traditional bun hairstyle. It would complement a formal outfit well. 
Jean Paul the teddy bear. Iris's best friend. She always carries him with her and takes good care of him. 
This key will let me enter rooms I couldn't before. 
I found this in a bedroom on the second floor. Now I can get into the room at the back. 
A teacup Iris asked me to get for her. It has a very stylish design. 
This is the matchbox Iris asked for. Its logo is quite colorful. 
A knife Iris asked me to get for her. Just a normal utensil you'd use during a meal. 
A prop sword and shield used onstage. They're well made and look just like the real thing. 
A prop crown used onstage. It's well constructed and incredibly detailed. 
A wig and costume used onstage. I wonder what kind of act could use a flashy outfit like this? 
A photo of Sakura in her swimsuit. Wow, this is really something. I'm gonna treasure this. 
A photo of Sumire in her stage costume. Her distinctive makeup really makes an impact. 
A photo of Maria on stage in the uniform from "For Love"… a beautiful woman disguised as a man. 
A photo of Kanna in her training gear. Catching her in a private moment like this feels surprisingly intimate. 
A photo of Iris in her swimsuit. She's holding a rubber ring and looks ready to have some fun. How cute. 
A photo of Kohran. I don't get to see her with her braids undone very often. It's a nice look. 
A photo of Ayame in a traditional outfit. I hope she'll always be as happy and content as she is here. 
Ayame's gun. Why…? Why did it have to turn out like this…? 
Raaaaaghhh! Wretched Imperial Combat Revue… how dare you… how dare you do such a thing to my brother! 
To avenge my brother… I, Silver Rasetsu, will repay you in kind! 
Those two…  I'm sure they'll think up something interesting for us. 
Hey, Kohran. Know what day it is tomorrow? 
Pipe down now, Iris. They're in the middle of rehearsal. 
Quiet, Iris! It's important to listen to everyone else's lines, too. 
…You're no fun at all. 
Look, there they go. Wonder who'll come out the winner? This'll be the match of the century! 
Hey, Maria. Know what…?
Iris. Chattering during rehearsal is prohibited. 
How boring. 
I'm gonna go play with Uncle Ichi! 
Ah   Iris! Where are you going; we're rehearsing right now! Come back! 
I don't wanna! Bye bye! 
Sheesh… just when I think I've gotten out of ticket punching, I get roped into sorting pay slips…  
And here I thought I could take it easy until the performance of "Love is a Diamond" starts next week…  
That's enough of your grumbling, if you don't mind. You're nearly finished anyway, isn't that right? 
Yeah, you're right…  
Finally done! Is this enough for today, Kasumi? 
Yes, this will be fine. Good work today, Ogami. 
Phew, done at last. I'll be on my way, then. 
Nice work today, Ogami! 
I'm done with work, so I guess I'll go back to my room and relax. 
Ogami! 
Hey, Sakura. What's up? 
Um, Ogami… have you seen Iris? 
Yeah, I did. <br> No… I haven't. 
Yeah, I did. 
Really? Where was she? 
Um… where was it, again…  
…Did you REALLY see her? 
Sorry… looks like I was mistaken. 
I see… where on earth could she have gone… ?
No…  I haven't. 
I see… honestly, where could she have gone off to? 
…I suppose you haven't seen her. I wonder where she could have gone…  
Did something happen with Iris? 
Yes… she ran off somewhere right in the middle of rehearsal. 
Knowing Iris, I'm sure she'll turn up somewhere when you least expect it. 
I suppose. 
Well, if you happen to see her, please tell her to come back to the stage. 
Oh… by the way, Ogami. Are you free tomorrow? 
I was actually thinking of doing a deep clean of the set room. I don't suppose you'd be willing to lend me a hand? 
I'll think about it. <br> Sure thing, I'll help you. <br> Sounds like a pain…  
I'll think about it. If I have some time tomorrow, I'll come help you out. 
Oh, really? Then if you think you'll have the time, please do come by the set room. 
Sure thing, I'll help you. I don't have anything else planned at the moment. 
Thanks so much! Okay, I'll be waiting for you at the set room tomorrow. 
Cleaning the set room? Sounds like a pain…  
It's fine if you don't want to. Don't force yourself to come help on my account…  
Um, but if you have the time and don't mind, please do come by and help. 
Uncle Ichi! 
Huh? That voice… is that Iris? 
Ehehe… Uncle Ichi! 
Hey, Uncle Ichi. Let's go on a date tomorrow! 
Eep… a date?! 
A… date?! 
So… you'll come, right? 
Okay, let's do it. <br> What to do… <br> Sorry, I can't go tomorrow. 
What to do…
It'll be fun! Okay, that settles it! 
I mean, tomorrow is my birthday! 
Eh? Really? 
Yep! So, I wanna be with you tomorrow. 
Sounds good, right? Let's go on a date together, Uncle Ichi! 
I can't go tomorrow… I've already got plans. 
…  
…  
Huhhh?! No way! 
I mean, tomorrow is my birthday! 
Eh? Really? 
Yep! So, I wanna be with you tomorrow. 
What a dilemma…  
You'll come, right Uncle Ichi? 
I mean, tomorrow is my birthday! 
Eh? Really? 
Yep! So, I wanna be with you tomorrow. 
Sounds good, right? Let's go on a date together, Uncle Ichi! 
Okay, let's go! <br> I really can't make it. <br> Sakura, do you mind? 
Okay, let's go! After all, your birthday only comes once a year. 
Hooray, you're coming! Thank you, Uncle Ichi! 
That's wonderful, Iris. 
Ogami… I'll ask for your help with cleaning another day. 
After all, birthdays are important since they only come once a year. 
Sorry about this, Sakura. 
It's all right. I'll ask for your help some other time, instead. 
See you later, Iris. Rehearsal is over for today, so make sure you get to bed early tonight. 
Okay! Thank you, Sakura! 
I really can't make it. I have other plans tomorrow. 
Uncle Ichi…  
You must hate me…  
N no, Iris, I…  
Forget it! Uncle Ichi, you meanie! 
Iris…  
Ogami… maybe it would've been best to humor her? 
But…  
…  
Well, I should continue with rehearsal…  
Pardon me. 
Her birthday… I feel pretty bad for her. 
I'll go apologize to her tomorrow. 
Sakura, do you mind? 
Ogami, please go along with Iris tomorrow. 
We can clean anytime, but a birthday only comes once a year. 
Sakura…  
Yeah, Sakura's right! Hooray! Uncle Ichi and I are going and a date! 
I'm heading back to the stage, so I'll be on my way. 
Huh? Well…  
How come you have to ask Sakura about every little thing?! 
Well…  
Forget it! Who needs you, Uncle Ichi! 
Iris…  
I'm sorry, Ogami… it seems I've upset Iris. 
Hey, don't trouble yourself over it. 
…  
Well then, Ogami, I'll be on my way. 
Her birthday… I feel pretty bad for her. 
I'll go apologize to her tomorrow…  
Ogami, please go along with Iris tomorrow. 
We can clean anytime, but a birthday only comes once a year. 
Sakura…  
Yeah, Sakura's right! Hooray! Uncle Ichi and I are going and a date! 
Guess I have no choice…  
Hooray! I'm so excited! 
See you later, Iris. Rehearsal is over for today, so make sure you get to bed early tonight. 
Okay! Thank you, Sakura! 
Okay, let's do it. I've never really gotten the chance to go anywhere with you, Iris. 
Yaaay! Thank you, Uncle Ichi! I'm so happy! 
Oh, I see, Ogami. You can't be bothered to help me out, but you have enough time to spend with Iris? 
Eep?! That's not what I…  
Ogami, you just promised me you'd help me with cleaning! 
Eep! W well, I…  
No way! Sakura, stop trying to steal Uncle Ichi away! 
I mean, tomorrow is my birthday, after all! 
Eh? Really? 
If that's true, you should've mentioned it sooner…  
In that case… Ogami, why don't you go out with Iris tomorrow? 
Yeah, Sakura's right! Hooray! Uncle Ichi and I are going and a date! 
Well then, Ogami, I'll be on my way. 
Hey, Uncle Ichi! You should help me pick out which outfit to wear tomorrow! 
Huh? What's wrong with what you're wearing now? 
I can't wear this! It's our first date, so I have to look my best! 
So, you have to come to the wardrobe room and help me pick out what to wear! 
It's late, call it a day. <br> I'm not sure…  <br> Leave it to me! 
It's getting late, so let's call it a day, okay Iris? 
Huuh? That's no fun! 
You wouldn't want to oversleep for tomorrow, right? Best to go to bed early tonight. 
Okay, I got it…  
Right, so tomorrow, you should come to my room to pick me up. 
Bye bye! 
A date with Iris tomorrow, huh… ? Wonder what we'll end up doing…  
Hmm… I don't know all that much about clothes. 
That's okay! Let's go, let's go! 
Leave it to me! I'll pick out something that looks great on you, Iris. 
Really? You're the best, Uncle Ichi! I'm counting on you! 
Okay, let's go! Hurry, hurry! 
Don't look so grumpy, it'll be fine! 
I hope you'll pick out something that looks good on me. 
Hmm… I'm not too sure of myself, but I'll give it a shot. 
Yay! Okay, let's go! Hurry, hurry! 
You've got Jean Paul with you as usual, I see. 
Of course! He's my friend, so we're always together. 
(Jean Paul, eh? It certainly is a French sounding name.) 
Eheheh… Isn't this ribbon sooo cute? It's my favorite! 
Eheheh… Isn't this ribbon sooo cute? It's my favorite! 
Blonde hair… how lovely. 
Good grief, Ogami! 
Blonde hair… how lovely. 
Good grief, Ogami! 
(She seems really happy for some reason.) 
You look pretty happy. Did something good happen? 
Hee hee… what's up? 
(She seems really happy for some reason.) 
Uncle Ichi, wait! Where are you going? 
Sheesh, what're you looking at? 
This is the wardrobe room… you're going to choose your outfit from here? 
Yep. I brought some of my own clothes from my room in here. 
Okay, Uncle Ichi. Pick out something that'll look good on me! 
You've got great taste. I'm kinda surprised! 
Really? I'm glad you like what I picked out. 
Yeah! Thanks to you, I've got my outfit all ready for tomorrow. 
What's it look like? 
It's a seeecret! You'll see it tomorrow! 
Well, I'm going to bed. I don't wanna oversleep tomorrow. 
You can come to my room tomorrow to pick me up, Uncle Ichi. Night night! 
I wonder what sort of outfit Iris will wear tomorrow…  
Anyway, I can't imagine what we'll do on a date together…  
Sorry, Iris. I guess you didn't like the outfit I picked out? 
That's not true. You did your best picking one out. 
I have all kinds of outfits, but I already decided on one for tomorrow. 
What's it look like? 
It's a seeecret! You'll see it tomorrow! 
Well, I'm going to bed. I don't wanna oversleep tomorrow. 
You can come to my room tomorrow to pick me up, Uncle Ichi. Night night! 
I wonder what sort of outfit Iris will wear tomorrow…  
Anyway, I can't imagine what we'll do on a date together…  
Sorry. I tried picking out an outfit you might like…  
Really? You weren't just messing around when you picked this out? 
No, of course not. I put my heart and soul into it. 
…Whatever. 
During all that changing, I found the dress I'm gonna wear anyway. 
Really? Which one? 
It's a seeecret! You'll see it tomorrow! 
Well, I'm going to bed. I don't wanna oversleep tomorrow. 
You can come to my room tomorrow to pick me up, Uncle Ichi. Night night! 
I wonder what sort of outfit Iris will wear tomorrow…  
Anyway, I can't imagine what we'll do on a date together…  
I promised Iris we'd go on a date today…  
I'm pretty sure she wanted me to meet her at her room. All right, better get going. 
It's Ogami… Iris, you there? 
Good morning, Uncle Ichi! You came right on time! 
Good morning, Uncle Ichi. I see you came to get me! 
Uncle Ichi, you're super late! 
S sorry… I got caught up in getting ready…  
Sheesh… I'll let you off easy this time, since today is my birthday. 
Are you bringing Jean Paul along on our date, too? 
That's right. Jean Paul wants to go out too, you see. 
Oh, I see! You'll be jealous if Jean Paul comes too, won't you? 
…You saw right through me. <br> Not really? <br> Can't you leave him here? 
Yes, you're absolutely right. And here I thought I'd get the chance to spend some time alone with you…  
Eh? Really?! 
But, I'd feel bad to leave him all alone…  
So, is it okay if we bring him along? He promises he won't get in the way! 
Um, not really. 
Is that so? You can tell me the truth, Uncle Ichi. 
But, I'm sorry… Jean Paul gets really lonely by himself. 
So, is it okay if we bring him along? He promises he won't get in the way! 
I see… all right, then. 
Can't you leave him here? He won't even know the difference. 
You're horrible! Jean Paul is my friend! 
There's no way I can leave him here! 
Oh! You're acting all shy, Uncle Ichi! Hee hee, it's so cute~! 
(So she's bringing Jean Paul… that's fine, as long as she doesn't lose him… ) 
Your ribbon looks as cute as ever. 
Uncle Ichi, don't keep staring at the same spot. 
Your ribbon looks as cute as ever. 
Uncle Ichi, don't keep staring at the same spot. 
Hey hey, isn't there somewhere else you want to look at? 
Hey hey, isn't there somewhere else you want to look at? 
(Her eyes are sparkling. She must really be enjoying this date.) 
(Her eyes are sparkling. She must really be enjoying this date.) 
You're wearing something different from usual today. 
So, I was able to help by choosing an outfit last night? 
Yep! I liked this one best. 
Say, Uncle Ichi. What do you think of this outfit? 
It's very cute. <br> It's pretty nice, I guess. <br> Your usual outfit's better. 
It's very cute. It suits you well, Iris. 
Really?! Thank you, Uncle Ichi… that makes me so happy! 
I wore them just for you. I'm glad you like them! 
Well now, shall we get going? 
Yeah! Let's go, let's go! Uncle Ichi, this way! Hurryyyy! 
It's pretty nice, I guess. It looks good on you. 
Thank you, Uncle Ichi. I like this outfit, too. 
Well now, shall we get going? 
Yeah! Let's go, let's go! Uncle Ichi, this way! Hurryyyy! 
I like your usual outfit better. 
Huh?! But I picked this one out just for you…  
Uncle Ichi, do you not like this outfit? 
Oh, no… I didn't mean that…  
It's okay. Anyway, let's hurry up and go! We're wasting time! 
Umm… I never know what to say in situations like this. 
Jeez, Uncle Ichi… you don't understand a girl's heart at all! 
But… that's just one of the charming things about you! 
W well, why don't we get a move on? 
Yeah! Let's go, let's go! Uncle Ichi, this way! Hurryyyy! 
Well, shall we get going? Let's head outside for now. 
Oh, Uncle Ichi! Wait a second! 
Jeez, you didn't even notice what I'm wearing! 
The train's nearly here. 
Hey, Uncle Ichi. Where are you gonna take me? 
Shopping at the Dept. Store <br> See a movie in Asakusa <br> Ueno Zoo 
Why don't we go shopping at the Nipponbashi Department Store? I'll buy something for you, Iris. 
Really?! Yaaay! I wonder what you'll get me? 
Oh, but…  
What's wrong? 
Um, Uncle Ichi… I wanna go to Asakusa. 
Asakusa? 
Yeah. Kohran said that when she was at the Hanayashiki branch, she went to Asakusa all the time. 
She said there's lots of shops and that it's really interesting. So, let's go to Asakusa! 
Got it. To Asakusa we'll go, then. 
Yeah! Let's go, right now! 
Would you like to go see a movie in Asakusa? 
Okay! If we're going to Asakusa, I don't mind! 
Really… did you want to go to Asakusa? 
Yeah. Kohran said that when she was at the Hanayashiki branch, she went to Asakusa all the time. 
She said there's lots of shops and that it's really interesting. So, let's go to Asakusa! 
All right. To Asakusa we'll go, then. 
Yeah! Let's go, let's go, right now! 
How about we go to the Ueno Zoo? I've heard they have all kinds of rare animals there, like kangaroos. 
Yaay, the zoo! Let's go, let's go!… Oh, but…  
Hey, Uncle Ichi… I wanna go to Asakusa. 
Asakusa? 
Yeah. Kohran said that when she was at the Hanayashiki branch, she went to Asakusa all the time. 
She said there's lots of shops and that it's really interesting. So, let's go to Asakusa! 
All right. To Asakusa we'll go, then. 
Yeah! Let's go, let's go, right now! 
Hmm… where should we go…  
Come on, Uncle Ichi. When you're on a date, you're supposed to lead the lady around. 
So… why don't you take me to Asakusa? Okay? 
Asakusa? 
Yeah. Kohran said that when she was at the Hanayashiki branch, she went to Asakusa all the time. 
She said there's lots of shops and that it's really interesting. So, let's go to Asakusa! 
All right. To Asakusa we'll go, then. 
Yeah! Let's go, let's go, right now! 
We've arrived in Asakusa. Where do you want to go, Iris? 
I'll go anywhere you wanna go, Uncle Ichi. 
Okay then… wonder where we should go first. 
Let's take a walk in the park.<br>Let's go to the movie theater.<br>Let's go shopping.
Let's take a walk in the park.<br>Let's go to the movie theater.
Let's take a walk in the park.<br>Let's go shopping.
All right, let's take a walk in the park.
Let's go to the movie theater.<br>Let's go shopping.
Let's go to the movie theater.
Let's go shopping.
All right, let's take a walk in the park. 
Okay! Let's go, let's go! 
Oh, there's a fountain! Let's go over there, Uncle Ichi! 
Hey, Uncle Ichi… I have a favor to ask. 
What is it? 
I want to walk together with you like we're a couple. 
(Like a couple… ) 
Hold her hand. <br> Link arms with her. <br> Give her a piggyback ride. 
All right, let's walk holding hands. 
Okay! Don't let go, Uncle Ichi. 
Okay, let's walk with our arms linked. 
Eh? Really?! Hee hee… my heart's racing! 
Oh, but… your arm won't reach that high, will it? 
Oh…  
You're right. Okay then… why don't we hold hands instead? 
Ah, good idea. 
We'll try linking arms when you get a little bigger. 
I hope I can grow up soon, so that I can walk with my arm linked in yours, Uncle Ichi…  
All right, I'll give you a piggyback ride. 
Piggyback?! 
Uncle Ichi, what sort of couple gives piggyback rides? 
You still think of me as a child, don't you! 
S-sorry, Iris… that's not what I meant…  
Forget it! I've had it with you, Uncle Ichi! 
Iris, wait! You're gonna get lost! 
I am not a child! I won't get lost! 
Are you shy, Uncle Ichi? I'll just take your hand myself! 
Oh…! 
Eheheh… it's like we're really a couple. 
Y-yeah, it is. 
Walking along holding hands with you like this is a dream come true! 
Why don't we take a short rest here, Iris? 
Okay then. But make sure you don't let go of my hand. 
I got it. 
By the way, Uncle Ichi…  
What is it? 
Do you know how old I turn today? 
Iris, wait up! 
Sorry… I shouldn't have done that. 
Uncle Ichi. Today is my birthday, you know. 
Yeah. 
So… how old do you think I'm turning today? 
8 years old? <br> 10 years old? <br> 12 years old? 
Hmm… 8 years old? 
Wrong! I'm not some little kid! 
I'm turning 10 years old today! I won't be a kid forever! 
S-sorry…  
I'm sorry. Forgive me, Iris. 
Okay. As long as you understand, it's fine. Hey, Uncle Ichi… why don't we go somewhere else? 
I'm tired of this place! 
Hmm… 10 years old? 
Ding ding! You're smart, Uncle Ichi! You got it exactly right. 
With this, I'm in the same decade of life as Sakura and the others! 
Sure enough… if they're in their teens, then that makes you a pre teen. 
Yep, that's right! Hey, Uncle Ichi… why don't we go somewhere else? 
I'm tired of this place! 
Hm… 12 years old? 
Eh?! Do I really look that grown up? 
I'm turning 10 years old today. 
I see… sorry, guess I got it wrong. 
Oh, that's okay. Because that means you think I look really grown up, right? 
Y-yeah…  
Yup! Hey, Uncle Ichi… why don't we go somewhere else? 
I'm tired of this place! 
You don't know, Uncle Ichi? I'm turning 10 years old today. 
10 years old, huh…  
With this, I'm in the same decade of life as Sakura and the others! 
Sure enough… if they're in their teens, then that makes you a pre teen. 
Yep, that's right! Hey, Uncle Ichi… why don't we go somewhere else? 
I'm tired of this place! 
Whoa… looks like it's nearly time for the movie to start. 
Iris, let's make our way to the movie theater. 
Okay! 
We're just in time. Let's go inside. 
For some reason, my heart is pounding. 
Okay, let's go over to the movie theater. 
This is the movie theater. They're something of a rival to our own theater. 
Hmm… it's a place where they show movies, which are like plays made from moving pictures… sort of. 
Looks like today, they're playing one called "Breakthrough of the Century: Introducing a Rare Creature!" 
Sure thing. Let's go inside.

Sure thing. Let's go inside. 
Huh? There's still about an hour before the start of the next film screening. 
No point in hanging around here… let's go somewhere else, Iris. 
All right, let's go shopping. 
Okay! I wanna go to that jewelry shop over there! 
Huh?! H hang on, Iris. I can't buy any jewelry! 
It's fine! Hurry, hurry! 
Welcome sir, and young miss. Take your time and look around. 
What the… it's an accessory store. I thought it was for jewelry…  
Hey, fella… why don't you buy something for the young lady here? 
Yeah! Present, present! 
My, you two seem close. She your little sister? 
She's my daughter. <br> She's my coworker. <br> She's my girlfriend. 
No, she's my daughter. 
Uncle Ichi! What do you mean, I'm your daughter?! 
S sorry. I was only kidding. 
Jeez! Don't say such weird stuff; we're out on a date and everything! 
Uncle, eh… then, the two of you ARE related? You don't look alike at all…  
No way! He's my boyfriend! 
B-boyfriend? 
I-Iris?! 
No… she's a coworker. 
A coworker? Hm, so what sort of work does a young girl such as this do? 
Uh… well, you see…  
Ah, it's not important. Take your time and look around! 
No… she's my girlfriend. 
G-girlfriend?! Really, now? These foreigners sure are open to anything…  
…Uncle Ichi. 
Thank you… that makes me so happy. 
Well then, sir! How about buying something for your cute little girlfriend, here? 
Hmph, unfriendly fella, aren't ya? 
No matter. Since you're here, take the time to look around. 
So you'll take the hairpin? Pleasure doing business with ya! 
Happy birthday, Iris. Here's my present to you. 
Thank you, Uncle Ichi! 
Do you like it? 
Yeah! I'm gonna treasure it! 
So, where should we go now, Uncle Ichi? 
That hairpin's a great choice. It'll look fantastic in that golden hair of hers, won't it? 
The hair accessory, then? Here you are, thanks for the business! 
Happy birthday, Iris. Here's my present to you. 
Thank you, Uncle Ichi! 
Do you like it? 
Yeah! I'm gonna treasure it! 
So, where should we go now, Uncle Ichi? 
That hair accessory is a good choice. Wouldn't it look nice in the young lady's hair instead of that ribbon? 
The pendant, then? Excellent choice, sir! Thanks for your patronage! 
Happy birthday, Iris. Here's my present to you. 
Thank you, Uncle Ichi… I was just thinking of how much I wanted this. 
I'm really happy! 
Do you like it? 
Yeah! I'm gonna treasure it! 
So, where should we go now, Uncle Ichi? 
How can you call yourself a man and refuse to buy this for your lady? Come on, sir! I'll even give you a nice discount. 
Huh?! Uncle Ichi, will you buy it for me? 
Whoa… looks like it's nearly time for the movie to start. 
Iris, let's make our way to the movie theater. 
Mmhmm! 
Right, it's almost time. Let's go inside, Iris. 
Yaay! I'm getting so excited! 
Why don't we sit here? Careful, it's dark. 
I don't know either, but I bet it'll be interesting. 
Ahem…  
He's called a "narrator". He's the person who explains the story. 
Since the movie doesn't have any sound, the narrator tells us what's happening onscreen. 
Oh, it's starting. 
(Quite atmospheric…  
Huh!? 
… …  
(Iris is squeezing my hand… is she frightened?) 
Grasp her hand. <br> Speak to her. 
(Well… I'll try taking her hand.) 
…  
(Huh… Iris has pulled her hand away…) 
Iris… you okay? Do you want to go outside? 
That's all right… But don't feel like we have to stay. 
(I'd better keep an eye on her for now.) 
…!! 
Iris? Are you okay?! 
Iris, calm down! 
Iris?! 
Whaaaaaaah! 
Wh-what was that? An earthquake?! 
Iris! Please, calm down! 
Th-this is bad! At this rate, the building's gonna come down…  
Iris, it's not safe here! Get out! 
Ohhh, the theater… this is awful…  
Just what kind of power does Iris have… ? 
…Yes? 
Hey, Sakura. What's up? 
Um, I'm about to go clean the set room…  
If you don't mind, do you think you could lend me a hand? 
Sure, I'll help. <br> But I wanted to sleep in…  
Sure, I'll help. I'm not busy. 
Thank you so much! All right, let's get going. 
Sorry, I wanted to sleep in…  
I see… sorry to bother you so early in the morning. 
Well, I'll be going. 
I wonder if that was rude of me… but, I'm so sleepy…  
Okay, guess I'll try to grab a few more winks…  
Hmm…  
Sheesh, how late are you going to sleep? Come on, let's go! 
Come on, Sakura! Don't pull me like that! 
Hurry, hurry! 
This is the area we're cleaning? Oh man, this'll be a pain…  
That's right. We're doing the stage too, so it's quite a large area. 
If we didn't do this on our days off from performances, then it would never really get cleaned. 
There's a lot of equipment scattered around, so be careful. 
Nice work, Ogami! 
Thanks to you, the place is sparkling. 
It was no problem. You did a great job too, Sakura. 
Not at all. Because of your help, we finished in no time. 
I'll tidy up whatever's left… you're free to go, Ogami. 
Phew… I sure worked up a sweat. Better head back to my room and change clothes. 
Nice work, Ogami! 
It was no problem. You did a great job too, Sakura. 
Not at all. Because of your help, we finished in no time. 
I'll tidy up whatever's left… you're free to go, Ogami. 
Phew… I sure worked up a sweat. Better head back to my room and change clothes. 
You look worn out, Ogami. Finished already? 
Sorry. I just woke up, so my body's not moving how I'd like it to…  
It is pretty early, so don't push yourself. 
But we made a lot of progress here thanks to your efforts. 
That's good to hear, then. 
I'll tidy up whatever's left… you're free to go, Ogami. 
Phew… I sure worked up a sweat. Better head back to my room and change clothes. 
Umm… 
There. I've changed my shirt and I'm all freshened up. 
What to do now…? 
(Who is that? They sure are rowdy… ) 
I'm coming…  
Wh-what the… why are you all here? 
Wh… what is this? 
Captain… would you happen to know where Iris might've gone? 
We've searched the theater, but she's nowhere to be found. 
Don't lie to us if you know what's good for you, Boss! 
I know. <br> I don't know! 
Y-yeah, I know. 
You mean it? Where the heck is she? 
W-well…  
Everyone just wait a second! I have just the right thing for this occasion. 
What is that? 
You'll see in just a sec! Gimme your head, Ogami. 
Wh-what're you doing?! 
I don't know! She asked me on a date earlier, but that doesn't mean I know where she went…  
Are you being truthful? If you're lying, you will regret it! 
I'm not lying… you have to believe me! 
Everyone just wait a second! I have just the right thing for this occasion. 
What is that? 
You'll see in just a sec! Gimme your head, Ogami. 
Wh-what're you doing?! 
I…  Well…  
Ogami… if you know, please tell us! 
I feel like this may be partially my fault, too…  
What do you mean? 
Everyone just wait a second! I have just the right thing for this occasion. 
What is that? 
You'll see in just a sec! Gimme your head, Ogami. 
Wh-what're you doing?! 
What… is this?! 
My newest invention! It's a lie detector I call "Mr. Truth". 
A lie detector? That's pretty crazy! 
It's super easy to use. Just answer our questions and it will tell whether or not you're lying. 
You really are good at coming up with strange machines like this. 
Ahm, it says here "self destruction mechanism", what exactly does that mean? 
Isn't that self explanatory? Utter a lie and the machine will blow up. 
If someone's lying, there has to be some punishment after all! 
Wait a second. You're kidding, right? 
OK, let's get started. How 'bout a simple question as a warm up?
Are you Ichiro Ogami? 
Yes! <br> No! 
Yes! 
That was an easy one. If you had answered no, you would have been blown up. 
Kohran! Can you please take this thing off of me? 
Here comes question number 2! 
No! 
Mr. Ogami! 
…Huh? How come it didn't go bang? 
Are you sure that thing is working? Because no matter how you look at it, that was a clear lie. 
…Weird. Maybe there's a loose contact somewhere…  
…Anyway. I'm sure it will work now. Here comes question number 2. 
S-sir! 
…Oops! I didn't know that it would explode when you take too much time to answer…  that's strange. 
Are you sure this thing is working properly? 
…Weird. Maybe there's a loose contact somewhere…  
…Anyway. I'm sure it will work now. Here comes question number 2. 
Wait! I want to ask the next question! 
H, hey, Kanna! 
No worries, we're still in the test phase after all, aren't we? 
OK. The second question. Do you like tomboys? 
Yes! <br> No! 
Yes! 
It didn't blow up, so that's the truth. 
Well, look at that. So the boss likes tomboys, huh? 
I trust this machine less with every second. Are you really sure it works? 
Yeah, I gotta say, that last question made me a bit skeptical, too. 
Ah… I forgot to turn it on! So, now it should work! 
What… that's a real bummer. 
All right! With that out of the way let's cut to the chase. 
…  
Do you know where Iris is? 
No! 
It didn't blow up, so that's the truth. 
I see, so you don't like tomboys at all, huh? 
Ahahahaha…  I have to say that my trust in this machine just rose significantly. 
What was that, you hag? 
Stop it, you two! This isn't the time or place for a fight! 
Oh, look at that. I forgot to turn on the power! 
What?! So that question didn't count? 
I gotta say, by now I don't trust this machine at all. 
All right! With that out of the way let's cut to the chase. 
…  
Do you know where Iris is? 
Ogami! 
Huh? Why didn't it blow up? 
I trust this machine less with every second. Are you really sure it works? 
Yeah, I gotta say, that last question made me a bit skeptical, too. 
Ah… I forgot to turn it on! So, now it should work! 
What?! But I really wanted to get an answer…  
All right! With that out of the way let's cut to the chase. 
…  
Do you know where Iris is? 
Yes! <br> No! 
Yes! 
It works! I knew my inventions are perfection! 
Ogami! Are you OK!? 
It blew up even though you said that you knew where she is, so…  
So, he has no idea where she is…  what a waste of time. 
Well if the boss doesn't know it either, we better get going and look somewhere else. 
No! 
…It didn't explode. 
So if he doesn't know and it didn't blow up, that means…  
He really doesn't know. What a waste of time. 
Well if the boss doesn't know it either, we better get going and look somewhere else. 
If you weren't lying, why did you behave so suspiciously? 
Ogami! 
It works! I knew my inventions are perfection! 
Ogami! Are you OK!? 
Since it exploded because you took too long, we still don't know if you're lying or not. 
Mr. Truth is history as well. We're right back where we started. 
…Come on, everybody. Let's go look somewhere else. 
Oh boy… What did I do to deserve this? 
But… where could Iris be? I'm worried too. 
Let's try searching inside the theater for now. 
There are tons of stuffed animals in here…  
OK. Sorry for snooping around, Iris, but I really need to find some kind of clue. 
The summer sun is blinding…  
The window is locked. I doubt she could've gotten out from here. 
Iris loves that teddy bear of hers… looks like she loves rabbits, too. 
…This really isn't the time to be looking at this. 
Maybe she is hiding in here? 
…No. I'd feel bad for opening this without asking. 
Is this… a photo of Iris's parents? 
There's a huge castle behind them. I wonder where this was taken? 
Iris loves that teddy bear of hers… looks like she loves rabbits, too. 
…This really isn't the time to be looking at this. 
This is a cute lamp. What's it look like turned on? 
Hmm, I can't find the switch. Kind of a shame, but I guess I'll leave it. 
For now, I need to look for any clues to Iris's whereabouts. 
On the bed, she's got stuffed animals, and… hm? 
This is… a picture diary! 
Asakusa…? 
I see! So Iris was planning for us to go on a date to Asakusa! 
If we can't find her inside the theater, then…  
…she probably went to Asakusa on her own! 
Right. Since it's come to this, I'd better head to Asakusa as well! 
I have to take the steam train Ginza line to get there 
Wait for me, Iris. I'm on my way! 
Phew… finally made it to Asakusa. 
It's really a nice place for a date. A moving pictures theater, an amusement park…  No wonder it's crowded. 
…In the diary she wrote something about a fountain in the park. That's over there…  
…She's not here. Was this the wrong place? 
Oh… Iris?! 
…!! 
Iris… so you were here. 
Don't be silly. I was worried sick you'd gotten lost. 
I Iris… calm down! 
Whooooaaa! Th the fountain! 
Iris, stop! Stoooop! 
There's no performance today, so that means no patrons, either. 
There's no one here… guess I'll go somewhere else. 
There's no show today, so there's no reason for anyone to be here. 
I should go after Iris. 
It's already July… the summer sun is blisteringly hot. 
It's too hot here! I'll go someplace else. 
The girls love to relax here. Especially Sumire often comes here for a cup of tea…  
It would be a shame to spend a nice day like this alone in the library. 
I still have to meet up with Iris. I shouldn't keep her waiting so long. 
I wonder if Ayame is in. 
Ma'am…  may I ask where you're going? 
Where, indeed? I'm afraid that's a secret. 
Oh… there she goes. 
Hmm… where's she off to? 
I really should go pick up Iris. I kept her waiting long enough already. 
It doesn't seem like Ayame has returned yet. 
Phew…  coming back to your room after a job well done feels good. 
…But I don't have time to rest. I need to go and see Iris. 
Wonder if Sakura's in her room? 
…On second thought, I should go somewhere else. 
…She isn't here. I wonder where she is. 
Let's see if Kanna is in her room. 
…On second thought, I should go somewhere else. 
…She isn't here. I wonder where she is. 
Maybe I can have a little chat with Maria. 
…I guess I'll go somewhere else. 
…She doesn't seem to be here. 
I wonder if Kohran is in her room? 
I should go somewhere else. 
Ahem! It's me…  
…Sorry, boss, but I'm right in the middle of a new invention. Come back later. 
Iris must be waiting for me. 
I still have some time to kill before I go and see Iris. 
Maybe Sumire is in her room? 
I should go somewhere else. 
It's me, Ogami…  
I'm busy writing a letter at the moment. If you have need of me, come back another time. 
There's no show today, so there's no reason for anyone to be here. 
There's no one here…  I should go. 
This place actually looks pretty spacious, with no guests around. 
If I run any later, Iris will be really mad at me. 
On a day like this it's really peaceful here. 
If I don't hurry up, Iris won't let me hear the end of it. 
Oh, Ogami, hello. 
Oh, Ogami, is there something you forgot? 
Well, keep up the good work. 
Always glad to be of service! 
Well, keep up the good work. 
Come again! 
I'd better check somewhere else…  
(…It's Kanna. She's in a world of her own when she's eating… ) 
(I guess I'll leave her to it for now.) 
There's no show today, so everything is peaceful here. 
…Nothing to be done here. I should go somewhere else. 
…Huh? I can here voices from inside. 
Listen… I can only repeat what I already told you! 
…I already sent you a report regarding that incident. 
Maria Tachibana never used her Koubu without permission. It was all part of a tactical diversion. 
Maria defeated one of the leading figures of the Hive of Darkness on my orders. So what's the problem? 
…An inquiry? Do what you must. 
But I can tell you right away that I have no intention of firing Maria Tachibana. 
Manager Yoneda…  seems to be sleeping. 
…I guess I'll go somewhere else. 
It's Ogami… do you have a moment? 
Oh, Ogami. Door's open. 
zzZZZZzzz zzzzZZZZZzz 
Manager Yoneda… seems to be sleeping. 
This room has no use at all. After all I'm doing rounds every night. 
…I should go somewhere else. 
I helped Iris pick out her dress here just yesterday. 
I wonder what she'll be wearing today. 
…Iris must be waiting for me. I should go pick her up. 
…There's nobody here. No surprise, since there's no show today. 
Let's go somewhere else. 
I'm not an actor so there's nothing of interest for me here. 
Normally there's always someone here… not today though. 
As long as there isn't a show the stage doesn't get any use. 
I wish I could carry on with my free day as well. 
This place is always such a mess…  
There was no reason to come here. I'll go elsewhere. 
Sakura said she'd go get some water. 
…There's no use in waiting around like an idiot. I should get going. 
Ah, Ogami. 
Hey, Sakura. What are you doing here? 
I could ask the same of you. Shouldn't you be on a date with Iris? 
Ah… well, I just…  
Hahaha, just kidding. 
I figured since there's no show today, I'd use the time to clean the stage and this room. 
Keep up the good work. <br> Need any help? 
Keep up the good work. 
Thank you. You'll see, when you come back everything will be sparkling clean. 
But I have to admit that I envy Iris a little bit…  
…Huh, what was that? 
Oh, nothing, nothing at all. Have fun today. 
I really need to start cleaning now… See you later. 
Well… I really should be on my way, too. I shouldn't keep Iris waiting any longer. 
I really need to start cleaning now. 
See you later, Ogami. 
Well…  I really should be on my way, too. I shouldn't keep Iris waiting any longer. 
Nobody here…  No surprise really. 
Practice hasn't started yet. I should go somewhere else. 
This place really is pure chaos. 
…No use in hanging around any longer. I should go somewhere else. 
No one is using the room at this hour. 
If I waste any more time, Iris will be very angry. 
This is so inviting. I wish I had the time to go for a swim…  
…I really should be going. If I waste any more time Iris will be really angry with me. 
…Looks like Ayame is gone. There isn't anyone here. 
…Oh well. I'd better go, too. 
Oh, ma'am… you're done already? 
Oh, ma'am… So it was you in the shower. 
Yes. It was so refreshing. There really isn't anything like it on a hot summer day like this. 
But… how did you know that I took a shower? 
Well… I… I had a hunch…  
A hunch you say… really? 
Well, let's hope that you'll use these kind of hunches in your next battle as well. 
Yes, of course…
Teehehe, I'm just kidding. See you later, Ogami. 
Phew, looks like I've gotten away with it. 
There is nobody here… Guess, I'll have to look somewhere else. 
Wait… is that a shower running? 
Someone is taking a shower! 
I'm outta here! <br> I'm drawn to the shower…  
Going into the shower right now would be crossing the line. I'm outta here! 
Phew… I managed to get myself under control…  
But I'd really like to know who that was in the shower. 
No… my body… it's moving on it's own… toward the shower…  
(That… that's Ayame!) 
Ah… what a wonderful feeling. 
(She really looks stunning… ) 
OK, time to get out. 
(Whoa… If I stay here I'll be discovered!) 
(I'm done for! I need to run!) 
Phew, I think she didn't see me. 
But I have to say, seeing Ayame like this… what a lucky day…  
C-crap… I can't decide what to do! 
…? Anybody there? 
I'm dead! I need to get out of here! 
Phew, I think she didn't see me. 
But I'd really like to know who that was in the shower. 
There's no one here… there isn't any humidity either so I don't think anyone used it. 
There's nothing for me to do here… I should go somewhere else. 
There's a faint scent of soap in the air, and it's really humid in here. 
Ayame must have taken a shower here only minutes ago…  
Stop it! What are you thinking there, Ogami. 
…I should hurry and pick up Iris! 
This medical pod is powered by the steam machines in the basement…  
Let's hope we'll never need to use it! 
Ah, the heart of the Flower Division, the command center. This is where we assemble when the alarm sounds. 
But… there's no one here. I'll check another room. 
This is where our strategy meetings are held. 
I should go, I'm sure Iris is waiting for me. 
A steam powered computer…  
This machine can analyze the enemy's strategies and predict the outcome of battles. A true marvel of technology. 
Now that Kanna has joined us, the Flower Division is finally complete. 
All I have to do is give them the right orders. But that's the hard part. 
Heyyy! Iriiiis! 
She isn't here. I need to look somewhere else. 
Where are you, Iris? 
…Wait a second. The others said that her room was empty…  
It's July already…  What a nice sunny summer day it is. 
It's too hot here! I'll go someplace else. 
Ah, Ogami… Did you find Iris? 
No, not yet. 
…Maybe she didn't take it so well that you rejected going on a date with her? 
In that case it might be my fault that she has vanished. If I hadn't asked for your help…  
…There's no use in putting blame on anyone. Finding Iris is all that matters now. 
…Yes. 
This is the parlor. Sumire often drinks tea here. 
But no sign of Iris. 
Iris! Are you there? 
No answer. I should look somewhere else. 
Ma'am! Iris, she's…  
I heard. She's disappeared. 
…I'm sorry. If I had agreed to go out with her…  
…This is not the time for these kind of deliberations. We need to find Iris. 
Yes. 
Iris can't be in Ayame's room. I should look somewhere else. 
Phew… coming back to your room after a job well done feels good. 
…but I don't have time to rest. I need to find Iris. 
I wonder if Sakura is in her room? 
…On second thought, I should go somewhere else. 
…She isn't here. I wonder where she is. 
Maybe Kanna is in her room? 
…On second thought, I should go somewhere else. 
…She isn't here. I wonder where she is. 
I should talk with Maria for a bit. 
…I guess I'll go somewhere else. 
…She doesn't seem to be here. 
I wonder if Kohran is in her room? 
…I guess I'll go somewhere else. 
…nobody home. 
Iris… where are you? 
…That's it. I should go to Iris' room and see if I can find some clue. 
Maybe Sumire is in her room? 
I really should go somewhere else. 
…Seems there's no one here. 
Sir… have you found Iris? 
…No luck. I have looked everywhere. 
I see…  
But maybe I can find some clue in her room. 
Iris isn't here. I should look for her somewhere else. 
I guess she isn't here. Better look somewhere else. 
The theater's closed today, so there aren't any patrons…  
Iris really is nowhere to be found… this isn't good. 
She wouldn't have gone out all on her own, would she? 
Tsubaki… have you seen Iris? 
No. Did something happen with her? 
(Right… Tsubaki doesn't know Iris has vanished.) 
Tsubaki, have you seen Iris since we talked? 
…No, I don't think she has come through here. 
Well, keep up the good work. 
Always glad to be of service! 
Well, keep up the good work. 
Come again! 
I'd better check somewhere else…  
Iris… where did you go? 
This place is so quiet when there's not a performance going on. 
…It's no good. I'd better go somewhere else. 
Yuri, Kasumi, have you seen Iris? 
No! …Ogami, where might she have gone to? 
I just heard earlier that she has vanished. 
Really… so you two don't know, either. 
Of course we're going to worry. We'll help you look, too. 
Please do. 
Yuri and Kasumi are helping with the search as well… but still no sign of Iris. 
zzZZZZzzz zzzzZZZZZzz 
The manager's room… guess he's asleep. 
Maybe Iris is hiding in there… but probably not. 
…No, she really isn't in here. 
Iris! Come out! 
…I'd hoped she might be hiding in here… but she isn't. 
Ogami… did you find Iris? 
No, not yet. 
…The other day, she came by the office to see me. 
She asked me if I knew of a good date spot…  
Maybe she has gone out all on her own? 
…  
But the Imperial Capital is huge. Without any clue where to look we'll never find her. 
A clue… Hmmm…  
Iris used to sit here often…  
But she isn't anywhere to be seen. Maybe I should ask around a bit? 
Iris used to sit here often…  
But she isn't anywhere to be seen. Maybe I should ask around a bit? 
She isn't here either. I had hoped that maybe she was practicing. 
Let's head somewhere else. 
Boss… found Iris yet? 
No, I haven't. 
Really… she's not around here, either. 
Okay, I'm gonna try another room. 
Iris… where are you? 
Guess she isn't here. 
I'll try searching another room. 
Maybe she's hiding behind the sets? 
…Nope, not there. Iris, where are you? 
If she were in such an obvious place, we'd have found her already. 
Hmm… where did she go? 
Hey, Iris! Come on out! 
…No response. I thought she might be hiding in here…  
Oh well. I'll try another room. 
No one is using the room at this hour. 
…I guess I'll go somewhere else. 
Doesn't look like Iris is in the pool. 
Man… I'd love to take a swim, but searching for Iris comes first. 
No one here. Guess I'd better go elsewhere. 
Iris! Come out! 
…No response. Looks like she's not here. 
This medical pod is powered by the steam machines in the basement…  
…I just pray we won't ever need to use them…  
Iris… where are you? 
…Maybe I'll find some clue in her room…  
She isn't here either… dammit Iris, where are you? 
Maybe the steam computer can tell me Iris' whereabouts…  
No use in moping around. I have to find Iris. 
Ensign… Iris isn't here either. 
I see…  
I thought perhaps she would hide somewhere like this, since she's a child…  
I guess I was wrong. I'll look somewhere else for her. 
Iris… where are you? 
Iris~! 
…
Doesn't seem like she's here, either. 
How about it, Kohran? Found Iris yet? 
That's a negative. I searched the whole dang basement, but she's not down there. 
Ogami, did ya try looking in her room yet? 
Maybe she left some sort of clue behind. 
Her room, huh…? 
You'd like to buy this photo? Thank you! 
Oh, are you done? 
Ogami, I appreciate your interest, but…  
These photos are mainly for guests, so please just take one. 
Oh, I guess that's true. I'll come again some other time. 
Ogami, I appreciate your interest, but…  
These photos are mainly for guests, so please just take one. 
That's a photo of Sakura. That'll be 50 zeni. 
We need to leave some for the guests, so just take one for now, okay? 
You'd like to buy that? Thank you! 
Sakura is really becoming popular lately! She's very likable, I guess. 
That's a photo of Sumire. That'll be 50 zeni. 
You'd like to buy that? Thank you! 
Most of Sumire's fans are young rich guys, judging by their appearances. 
That's a photo of Maria. That'll be 50 zeni. 
You'd like to buy that? Thank you! 
Let's see, our top seller these days is… Maria's photo, I think? 
She's very popular among young ladies and students. 
That's a photo of Kohran. That'll be 50 zeni. 
You'd like to buy that? Thank you! 
Hmm… Kohran's fanbase is a bit of a mystery. 
That's a photo of Kanna. That'll be 50 zeni. 
You'd like to buy that? Thank you! 
Most of Kanna's photos go to kids who beg their parents to buy it for them. 
That's a photo of Iris. That'll be 50 zeni. 
You'd like to buy that? Thank you! 
Most of the guys buying Iris's photo are older gentlemen. 
They always glance around nervously when they buy it. I wonder if they're worried what people will think? 
H, hey, Ogami! Where do you think you're looking? Stop! 
Ogami… come on, don't stare at me like that. It's embarrassing. 
(A shopkeeper's outfit. Tsubaki looks good in it.) 
Tsubaki, if you happen to see Iris, please let one of us know. 
Sure thing, but… did something happen with her? 
Ogami… did something happen with Iris? 
No… it's nothing. 
This month's performance is called "Love is a Diamond"! 
Kanna and Sumire are playing the leads… Let's hope this works…  
…those two get along like cats and dogs, so I hope everything goes well. 
No kidding…  
Excuse me, ma'am. 
Oh, Ogami. Come in. 
Can I help you with something? I was just writing a report 
Oh… I see… I'm sorry to interrupt you. 
No, no, don't worry. I'm almost done anyway…  
Do you have any question about leading the squad? 
Ask for a battle report. <br>Ask for a casualty report. <br>No, thanks.
I'd like to hear about how our last battle impacted the surrounding area. 
There was only minimal damage to the surroundings. 
We were lucky that the battle took place in a storage facility. 
This Setsuna character… That was the first time we beat one of the Hive of Darkness' leaders without letting them escape. 
He did give us considerable trouble though, given his extraordinary speed…  
It was taking a heavy toll on the squad members, so it's good you defeated him as fast as you did. 
You took a long time to defeat him, considering it was only a single enemy. 
Reinforcements could have arrived any minute, so you should have finished it more quickly. 
…Yes. 
I suppose that summarizes the situation regarding the last battle… Is there anything else? 
No, thank you, ma'am. 
I'd like to hear the casualty report for the Flower Division from the last battle. 
The damage to the Flower Division was minimal. You did well, Ogami. 
You cared for those in your command and your judgments were spot on. 
…o-of course! Thank you, ma'am! 
The Flower Division consists of only seven members. Losing even one of them is a severe disadvantage. 
Though we should be grateful their life was spared. 
Of course…
Sakura's skills are by no means lacking, nor excellent. She shouldn't be sent without proper support. 
Sumire has excellent combat capabilities, but you mustn't overestimate her. She needs proper support. 
Maria's defenses are weak, so you should avoid placing her in close quarters combat situations. 
Kanna has the strength to even our own in close quarters combat. She's cut out to be an advance guard. 
It's a good idea to have her operate together with Maria or Sumire. 
Iris was angry. She still can't fight by herself, so we have to protect her…  
Kohran's attack power is weak, but she has wide range. Take that into consideration when giving her orders. 
As the commander, you must provide sufficient support. Your aid strengthens the bonds of the unit. 
I'm trusting you to look after them, Ogami. 
Yes, ma'am! 
We took extensive damage… provide better support, or they'll lose their faith in you. 
Yes, ma'am…  it was my failure. 
The damage was vast. If you continue with this style of battle… Ogami, you're a failure as captain! 
I need you to do better than this. 
Yes, ma'am… it was my failure. 
Oh yes, about Maria…  I couldn't help but notice something. 
Huh? What about her? 
Did you notice that she doesn't call you 'ensign' anymore? She's using "commander" instead. 
Oh… now that you mention it…  
Seems like she has finally started to accept you. 
Actually, she has been a lot friendlier in general. 
I think this is thanks to your influence. 
You… you think so? 
…Haha. Oh, and one more thing…  
…Yes. 
Iris told me that you're going on a date with her today. 
Of, of course. 
Behave yourself, Ogami. 
Oh, Ogami. Welcome! 
Oh, what can I help you with? 
Oh, you're leaving already? 
Yeah. See you! 
Do you need something? 
(Those traditional Japanese clothes look great on her.) 
(Even though she's relaxed, I can't see any openings… I wonder if she's had martial training?) 
(Gotta love the chest areas on traditional Japanese clothes… ) 
… …  
(She's actually got quite a…) 
Ogami! Please, I'd rather you didn't…  
Oh, sorry…  
(Not a hair out of place.) 
(She really does have beautiful hair…  she must spend a lot of time getting ready every day.) 
(She's got such a serene expression on her face.) 
(She looks nice, but I bet she's scary if you get her angry… She's kind of the reliable older sister type.) 
…is something the matter, Ogami? 
Oh, no, it's nothing, Kasumi. 
(There's a quiet, calm look in her eyes.) 
(Kasumi always looks people right in the eyes when she talks to them.) 
So, have you seen this month's play, "Love is a Diamond"? 
No, not yet. I've been rather busy. 
It's the perfect piece for Kanna and Sumire. 
…That reminds me, what are the other girls doing? 
Everyone else, including Iris, is working behind the scenes. 
That must be really boring for Iris…  
It seems like it. Please have an extra eye out for Iris, will you, Ogami? 
So, what are they going to play next month? 
The August show is "Journey to the West". Kanna will be playing Son Goku. 
Journey to the West… Classical opera material. 
The kids will be on summer break, so something family friendly will draw many visitors to us. 
I hope we don't have too many lost children this time. 
(That ribbon in her hair… it really suits her.) 
(I'd say that's a good charm point to go with Kasumi's mature looks.) 
Do you need me for anything? 
(Her clothes are pretty colorful.) 
(Maybe she's going for that popular bus guide look?) 
Something the matter, Ogami? 
No I was just thinking… your outfit is pretty cute. 
Oh, you noticed? I'm glad you like it! I actually coordinated this outfit myself. 
Is that so? 
(Goodness… that's certainly an aggressive neckline… ) 
(But… isn't this supposed to be a uniform?) 
Ahaha, Ogami. I see you've been stricken by my allure~! 
Hey, hey! 
(The way Yuri's hair curls away from her face is one of her charming points… ) 
(That bouncy look is pretty trendy.) 
Is something odd about my hair? Oh no~, I've got some split ends! 
(Her face is small and balanced. I think even a model would be jealous.) 
(It doesn't seem like she uses a lot of make up… she's got a nice foundation, doubt she really needs it… ) 
What's the matter, Ogami? You're staring at my face… Oh, I see. You've fallen for me, right? 
Hey, you shouldn't be teasing an adult. 
Hehehe… Sorry, Ogami! 
(Her eyes are shining with curiosity.) 
(Yumi's got a reputation for loving juicy gossip…) 
Hey, Ogami. Have you heard any good rumors lately? 
Lately, you can hear loud explosions coming from Kohran's room. 
I bet she's working on some suspicious machinery again. Exciting, isn't it? 
I wonder what it'll be this time? 
No idea… she was saying something about brains and sweat though. 
What the heck…? 
How are things going with Kanna? 
What do you mean… how are they going? 
She's a kind of no holds barred type of character, isn't she? 
She doesn't mean ill, but there are just people she rubs the wrong way, right? 
I don't know about everyone else, but at least Sumire is constantly fighting with her. 
Anyway, it's nice that the Flower Division is finally united again. 
Thank you.
Ever since that incident, Maria appears to be a totally different person. 
You think? 
Of course! She's much gentler now. 
She even smiles when guests ask her for her autograph…  
Before, she'd always treat it as a chore. I wonder what happened. 
I'd love to know that too! 
(She's got her scarf pinned with a brooch.) 
(I wonder what it's made of… Couldn't be a real jewel, right?) 
…Do you like my brooch? This thing was a bargain, I got it super cheap! 
…Oh. 
Looks like you and Sakura have been hitting it off lately, Ogami. 
R, really, you think so? 
She's really popular, with adults and children alike. 
Looks like you and Sumire have been hitting it off lately, Ogami. 
R, really, you think so? 
Most people see her as hard to approach, but they also feel that's what makes her attractive. 
She often gets flowers from high ranking young men. 
Looks like you and Maria have been hitting it off lately, Ogami. 
R, really, you think so? 
Maria is really popular with man and woman alike. Especially with young high school girls, actually. 
Ogami, seems like you've been pretty friendly with Iris lately. 
R, really, you think so? 
It's really easy to see her appeal. Older people are especially smitten by her. 
Seems like you've gotten pretty close to Kohran lately, huh, Ogami? 
Y-you think so? 
I don't really know what people like about her… Her fans are strange. 
Seems like you've gotten pretty close to Kanna lately, huh, Ogami? 
Y-you think so? 
Kanna's really popular with children. 
I guess she's like a hero they can relate to. 
It's Ogami… Kohran, are you there? 
Oh, hey Ogami! Just a sec…
Oh, drat! 
Whoa! Wh-what is it? 
Cough… cough…  Oh…  Hi, boss… What's the matter? 
Is everything alright, Kohran? 
I was just in the process of finishing my latest invention… That's when you showed up…  
I just had pulled out some wire when I got up to open the door. 
A-are you okay? <br> What are you making? 
A-are you okay, Kohran? That was quite an explosion. 
Yeah, everything's fine. I'm used to things blowing up around me…  
It's basically business as usual for me. Nothing that would bring me down. 
OK boss, I have to get back to work. So excuse me, please. 
Seems like she eats explosions for breakfast…  Not sure whether I should be impressed or worried. 
Anyway, I'd better get out of here. Kohran doesn't seem to be in the mood for a chat. 
…What are you making? 
It's a lie detector. I call him "Mr. Truth." 
What? What do you want to use this thing for? 
Well, what do you think, what for? Detecting lies of course! 
…Huh? 
I'm sure this invention will come in handy in an emergency! 
You never know when you're gonna need to know if someone's lying. Better be prepared. 
OK boss, I have to get back to work. So excuse me, please. 
Who knows… Maybe she's right and there really is a time when this machine will be of use. 
OK boss, I have to get back to work. So excuse me, please. 
She's still continuing after what happened?! I guess she never learns…  
Anyway I'd better get out of here. Kohran doesn't seem to be in the mood for a chat. 
It's Ogami… Are you there, Sumire? 
Oh, is that you, Ensign? Do come in, the door is open. 
Pardon me. 
Hi, Sumire. What are you up to? 
I'm writing a letter. After all, July is also called "Fumizuki", the month of letters. 
Oh yes. There was something I wanted to ask you, Ensign. 
I'm writing a letter to a friend I haven't met since school. What should I write as the closing? 
Yours faithfully. <br> Best regards. <br> Yours eternally. 
You usually write "Yours faithfully", don't you? 
Hm, I'm sure you're right, but isn't that a little too formal? 
Well, no matter. I'll ask Ayame for advice later. 
If you would excuse me, Lieutenant? I still have a letter to write…  
Oh, sure. See you later. 
Why don't you write "Best regards"? 
Ah! Yes, that sounds right! Not too formal and not too familiar. 
But I have to say… You know your stuff. 
I'm honestly impressed. 
Hahaha, thank you. I'm glad I could help. 
I'll finish up the letter now… Thanks a lot, lieutenant. 
I'll be going then. 
Why not something like "Yours eternally"? 
…Ensign, I'm not writing to a long lost lover. 
We really need to refine your manners…  
I'm sorry I couldn't be of help. 
It's alright. 
But I should really get back to finishing this letter… Would you mind, lieutenant? 
Sorry…  I'll see myself out then. 
So you don't know either? … Ah, well I'll just go and ask Ayame for advice later. 
But I should really get back to finishing this letter… Would you mind, lieutenant? 
Sorry… I'll see myself out then. 
Hi, Maria. 
…Commander. Isn't this a wonderful summer's day? 
I heard that the Japanese people celebrate something called "Tanabata". 
Apparently it's the day after tomorrow, but I'm still not sure what exactly people do on that day. 
We decorate dolls. <br> We write wishes on paper. <br> We put up pine trees. 
We decorate dolls and eat lots of colorful mochi. 
Wait isn't that "Doll's Day"? I thought that was on March the third. 
Oh… yeah… you are right…  
Commander, even I know that, and I'm from Russia. Please stop fooling around, OK? 
Well then, I'll… take my leave. 
Tanabata… so, summer really is here. 
That reminds me, I totally forgot about Iris. I better get going. 
We write wishes on paper strips and tie them to tree branches. 
Oh, right, now that you mention it, I think Ayame told me about that before. 
Wishes… So what are you going to write on your paper strip this year, commander? 
Wishes for the Division. <br> Wishes for Maria. <br> Wishes for myself. 
I'll write down my wishes for the Flower Division; that nobody gets hurt and we continue to have fun. 
I see; how very like you. I suppose I would wish for much the same thing. 
You've taught me a great deal, sir. I must thank you. Well, I'll be going now. 
Tanabata… so, summer really is here. 
That reminds me, I totally forgot about Iris. I better get going. 
I'd write that I want to better friends with you and we continue to have fun. 
Really… Thank you, sir. 
I…  I have to go now, thank you for the chat… Bye. 
Tanabata… so, summer really is here. 
That reminds me, I totally forgot about Iris. I better get going. 
I guess I would wish to stay healthy. 
That's right. There is nothing more important than health. 
You've taught me a great deal, sir. I must thank you. Well, I'll be going now. 
Tanabata… so, summer really is here. 
That reminds me, I totally forgot about Iris. I better get going. 
Hmm… I fear that I have way to many things I would wish for. 
Hahaha, really? I wonder what everyone else would write. 
You've taught me a great deal, sir. I must thank you. Well, I'll be going now. 
Tanabata… so, summer really is here. 
That reminds me, I totally forgot about Iris. I better get going. 
We put little pine trees in front of our houses, eat mochi and drink sake with herbs. 
Wait, isn't that what you do on new year's? Even I know THAT. 
I guess I'll find out myself soon enough. I have to go now. 
Tanabata… so, summer really is here. 
That reminds me, I totally forgot about Iris. I better get going. 
You don't know either, sir? 
Guess I'll have to wait and see then. See you later, sir. 
Tanabata… so, summer really is here. 
That reminds me, I totally forgot about Iris. I better get going. 
Sir, who was that on the phone just now? 
Huh? Whaddya mean? 
That, erm…  Maria's…  
I didn't use the phone at all. Ogami, you aren't drunk, are you? 
But I heard…  
Silence! I have to get ready for my nap now. Off you go! 
I…  Of course. Excuse me, sir. 
Oh, hey there, Kanna. 
Yo, boss. You gonna eat breakfast, too? 
No, just passing through. 
Really? It ain't good for you to skip breakfast, y'know. 
What do you usually eat first thing in the morning? 
Rice and miso soup. <br> Lots of bread. <br> I don't eat breakfast. 
Rice and miso soup. Can't get my morning started without them. 
You too?! We're so much alike! 
I tell you, if I don't eat at least ten bowls of rice in the morning I'm simply useless. Hahahaha! 
I…  I'm not sure we're on the same page…  
W well, take it easy. I'd better get going. 
Bye, boss! 
I eat lots of bread. Maybe some coffee, too. 
Huh… I don't hate bread myself, but…  
I just need some rice and miso soup in the morning. Otherwise I'm useless and have no energy the entire day. 
Ten bowls of rice, that what it needs to get me going! Ahahaha! 
Wow. I could never eat that much in the morning…  
It's never too late for a change! Hey, another bowl please! Over here! 
W well, take it easy. I'd better get going. 
Bye, boss! 
I don't eat breakfast. 
Whaaaat!? How do you keep up your energy if you don't eat something in the morning? 
It might be none of my business…  but boss…  you really need to eat breakfast! 
…Thanks, Kanna. 
Well, take it easy. I'd better get going. 
Oh yeah? Bye, boss! 
Hey, boss! What's the matter? 
Uh… sorry about that. I sort of spaced out. 
Still not entirely awake, huh? Come on, snap out of it! 
Y, yes sir! 
Hehe. Seems to have worked. OK, go get'em, tiger! 
OK…  
Do you want some help cleaning? It must be tough on your own, Sakura. 
Yes, but… I thought you were going on a date with Iris today. 
I'm sure it's no problem if I help you out for a short while. 
Really? Well in that case, stop standing around and grab that bucket! 
Thank you, Ogami! 
This floor's cleaner than ever, thanks to you. 
Oh no, I didn't do that much. You're the one working so hard, Sakura. 
Yes, but it was a lot more fun working together, so thank you for that. 
But you better hurry and go see Iris now. 
Phew.. that was quite the work out. 
OK… That ate up more time than I thought, I better go pick up Iris right now. 
Good work, Ogami. 
Oh no, I didn't do that much. You're the one working so hard, Sakura. 
Yes, but it was a lot more fun working together, so thank you for that. 
But you better hurry and go see Iris now. 
Phew.. that was quite the work out. 
OK… That ate up more time than I thought, I better go pick up Iris right now. 
You're already thinking about your date with Iris, aren't you, Ogami? 
You seemed to be really absent minded during the cleaning…  
No… it wasn't really that…  
But, I'm happy you helped out anyway. Thank you very much. 
But you better hurry and go see Iris now. 
You're right… I really spent quite some time here. 
If I don't go and pick her up immediately, she'll be really angry with me…

There's so many people… what's this place? 
What's that? 
I wanna see! I wanna see it! Can we?! 
Hey, what kind of story will it be? 
Uncle Ichi, who's that person? 
Ohhh… . 
Now then, we open at a laboratory deep, deeeeep within the mountains. 
In it lives a single scientist, obsessed with his research. 
I…  I'm no little girl anymore. And this isn't scary at all. 
I'm… fine. 
Waah… I'm scared! 
Please…  Make it stop…

No, stay away! 
Eeeeek! 
Don't give us that! Take a look at this! 
Stop acting like it's nothing!! What do you make of this! 
You wanna explain this, Ogami?! 
Goodbye. I'm going off to live by myself. 
I DID turn 10 years old today. Don't come looking for me. 
Stupid Uncle Ichi!
Tomorrow is my birthday and Uncle Ichi will take me on a date to Asakusa. 
I'm gonna look so pretty that he'll surely fall in love with me. 
And he will kiss me in front of the fountain in the park. 
Unused
You don't care about me, Uncle Ichi! You don't love me! 
I'm not stupid! I'm not a kid! I hate you, Uncle Ichi! 
I hate you… I hate you… I haaaate you!
