﻿It's a photo of Sakura. She's looking right at me. I wonder what she's thinking… 
It's a photo of Sumire. This is a side of her you don't see too often. 
It's a photo of Maria. …She's lost in thought and looks kind of sad… 
It's a photo of Kanna. Kanna's signature strength comes through clearly. 
It's a photo of Iris. She's surrounded by flowers and flashing a radiant smile. 
It's a photo of Kohran. She's looking pretty in profile with her face dyed red by the evening sun. 
A letter given to me by a patron. I was asked to give it to Sumire. I have a bad feeling about this… 
Maria's pistol. This may help me escape from here… 
A hair ornament. It's decorated with flowers and looks very elegant. 
A brooch. It's a beautiful piece of delicate craftsmanship. 
A hairpin for use in a traditional bun hairstyle. It would complement a formal outfit well. 
Jean-Paul the teddy bear. Iris's best friend. She always carries him with her and takes good care of him. 
This key will let me enter rooms I couldn't before. 
I found this in a bedroom on the second floor. I can use it to access the back room. 
A teacup Iris asked me to get for her. It has a very stylish design. 
This is the matchbox Iris asked for. Its logo is quite colorful. 
A knife Iris asked me to get for her. Just a normal utensil you'd use during a meal. 
A prop sword and shield used onstage. They're well-made and look just like the real thing. 
A prop crown used onstage. It's well-constructed and incredibly detailed. 
A wig and costume used onstage. I wonder what kind of act could use a flashy outfit like this? 
It's a photo of Sakura in her swimsuit. Wow, this is really something. I'm gonna treasure this. 
It's a photo of Sumire in her stage costume. Her distinctive makeup really makes an impact. 
It's a photo of Maria on stage in the military uniform from "For Love"… She's a beautiful woman disguised as a man. 
It's a photo of Kanna in her training gear. Catching her in a private moment like this feels surprisingly intimate. 
It's a photo of Iris in her swimsuit. She's holding a rubber ring and looks ready to have some fun. How cute. 
It's a photo of Kohran. I don't get to see her with her braids undone very often. It's a nice look. 
It's a photo of Ayame in a traditional outfit. I hope she'll always be as happy and content as she is here. 
Ayame's gun. Why…? Why did it have to turn out like this…? 
Phew… Is it already this late? 
A lot happened today… I should reflect on everything to get my mind in order… 
The Vessel and the Koma. <br> The Power of Purification. <br> The Sacred Demon Castle. 
The Pandemonium Vessel… So it's a key to open the Sacred Demon Castle… 
And if someone with a pure heart wields it, it can defeat even the most powerful Koma… 
The Koma… Monstrosities that have been at war with us humans since ancient times… 
A much more formidable foe than the Black Web, that's for sure. 
If they obtain the Pandemonium Vessel, they'll grow even more powerful and invade the earth. 
Then even we couldn't do a thing… 
We can't let them have the Pandemonium Vessel, that much is clear. 
The Pandemonium Vessel… 
If the Koma obtain the it, they'll grow even more powerful and invade the earth. 
We can't let them have the Pandemonium Vessel, that much is clear. 
The Power of Purification… 
That's the spiritual power that Sakura's dad supposedly possessed. 
It's said to be passed on in the Shinguji bloodline… 
But her father died before he could teach her how to use it. 
The Power of Purification… huh? 
The Sacred Demon Castle… The Koma's castle that was sealed away four hundred years ago. 
They aim to resurrect it, above all else… 
If we consider that, they'll surely come for the Pandemonium Vessel. 
We have to keep that underground storage room safe at all costs. 
The Sacred Demon Castle… The Koma's castle that was sealed away four hundred years ago, huh? 
"Abandon the Gods"… 
A writing on the Koma from ancient Japan. 
It's pretty hard to understand. 
The sealed land… A miracle out of the darkness… Could that have something to do with the Sacred Demon Castle? 
Maria seems to have read it, too… But she didn't know about the Pandemonium Vessel. 
Why did Yoneda show it to me and no one else? 
Anyway, I think I have everything straight now. 
Think about it some more. <br> Don't think about it. 
But, wait… Something doesn't check out. 
The effect of the Power. <br> Why the Vessel is here. <br> The Koma Wars. 
The Power of Purification… 
Only very few people remain of the bloodline that can wield it… 
Colonel Shinguji… Sakura's father used that power to defeat the Koma. 
But on the same day, he died… Is it so awesome that it takes a person's life to wield it? 
The Power of Purification… 
If we want to protect Teito, then we have to protect the Pandemonium Vessel. 
And protecting Teito is our highest duty as the Imperial Floral Storm Troop… 
Because of its properties, the Pandemonium Vessel must be closely guarded at all times. Maybe that's why it's here. 
Protect the Pandemonium Vessel from the Koma… That's our mission right now. 
Colonel Shinguji, Sakura's father, lost his life in the Koma Wars. 
And Major Shinnosuke Kanzaki disappeared… I wonder what kind of people those two were. 
The anti-demon unit fought the Koma without Spirit Armors or anything like that. 
If another all-out war against the Koma breaks out… 
No, there must never be a repeat of the Koma Wars. 
Question is, will we be able to prevent it? 
Hm? Who is it? Come in. 
Ah… Sakura… 
Ogami! Where have you been!? 
S-Sakura… What is it? 
I'm the one asking questions here. Where did you go with Ayame and what did you do? 
N-no… That's… 
So it's something you can't tell me? 
No, it's not like that! 
Then just answer me! I'm a member of the Flower Division too, you know! 
What… What should I do? 
Ah… Sumire… 
Ensign! Where have you been!? 
S-Sumire… What is it, all of a sudden? 
I'm the one asking questions here. Where did you go with Ayame and what were you up to? 
N-no… That's… 
You can't even tell me? 
No, it's not like that! 
Then out with it! Why would you need to hide something from me? 
What… What should I do? 
Ah… Maria… 
Ogami… 
M-Maria… What's the matter? 
…Isn't there something you've been hiding from me? 
N-no… That's… 
Something… you just can't tell me… 
No, it's… it's not what you think! 
Then out with it! No excuses! 
What… What should I do? 
Ah… Kohran… 
Chief… 
K-Kohran… What's up? 
…Isn't there something you've been hiding from me? 
N-no… That's… 
It's something… you just can't tell me, right? 
No, it's… it's not what you think! 
Then please tell me! I'm a member of the Flower Division, too, you know? 
What… What should I do? 
Ah… Iris… 
Mon Frère… 
I-Iris… What can I do for you? 
…What have you been up to with auntie Ayame? 
Er… nothing at all… 
What have you done? Tell me! 
No, it's… it's not what you think! 
Then what is it? Something I mustn't know? 
What… What should I do? 
Ah… Kanna… 
Boss… 
K-Kanna… What is it? 
…What were you and Ayame doing? 
Er… nothing at all… 
…You really need to keep secrets from me? 
No, it's… it's not what you think! 
Then what is it!? What's so terrible that even I can't know it? 
What… What should I do? 
Tell the truth. <br> Tell a lie. 
To be honest… 
To be honest…? 
It's top secret. I was instructed not to tell anyone. 
…? 
What the enemy's after seems to be a ritual item called the Pandemonium Vessel… 
Pandemonium Vessel? 
Right now, it's all that keeps the Koma's power at bay. 
If it were to fall into their hands, then that could mean the end of the world. 
…What!? And where is this Pandemonium Vessel? 
It's hidden somewhere here. Ayame and I were ordered to keep it safe, and its existence a secret. 
…Don't you understand? I told you everything I could. 
Ogami… 
(Sakura doesn't know…) 
(That her father… gave his life…) 
Ogami? 
(If she knew, then… I'm sure, she'd…) 
(She must not know…) 
Sakura… 
…? 
I promise I'll protect you and the rest of the Flower Division… 
Ogami… 
And we'll fight the Koma together! 
…Yes! 
To be honest… 
To be honest…? 
It's top secret. I was instructed not to tell anyone. 
Top secret…? 
What the enemy's after seems to be a ritual item called the Pandemonium Vessel… 
Pandemonium Vessel? 
Right now, it's all that keeps the Koma's power at bay. 
If it were to fall into their hands, then that could mean the end of the world. 
Wh-what!? And where on earth is this infernal device? 
It's hidden somewhere here. Ayame and I were ordered to keep it safe, and its existence a secret. 
…Don't you understand? I told you everything I could. 
Ensign… 
To be honest… 
…? 
It's top secret. I was instructed not to tell anyone. 
Top secret…? 
What the enemy's after seems to be a ritual item called the Pandemonium Vessel… 
Pandemonium Vessel? 
(I see… So even Maria wasn't let in on the Pandemonium Vessel…) 
Right now, it's all that keeps the Koma's power at bay. 
If it were to fall into their hands, then that could mean the end of the world. 
And where on earth is this Pandemonium Vessel? 
It's hidden somewhere here. Ayame and I were ordered to keep it safe, and its existence a secret. 
…Don't you understand? I told you everything I could. 
Ogami… If it's top secret, can you really tell me? 
That's much better than if you got the wrong idea… 
Ogami… 
To be honest… 
Yes…? 
It's top secret. I was instructed not to tell anyone. 
Top secret…? 
What the enemy's after seems to be a ritual item called the Pandemonium Vessel… 
The Pandemonium Vessel… 
Right now, it's all that keeps the Koma's power at bay. 
If it were to fall into their hands, then that could mean the end of the world. 
Wait a second! And where is that Pandemonium Vessel thing? 
It's hidden somewhere here. Ayame and I were ordered to keep it safe, and its existence a secret. 
…Don't you understand? I told you everything I could. 
Chief… 
To be honest… 
Yes…? 
It's top secret. I was instructed not to tell anyone. 
Top secret… What's that mean? 
What the enemy's after seems to be a ritual item called the Pandemonium Vessel… 
Demon what? 
Right now, it's all that keeps the Koma's power at bay. 
If it were to fall into their hands, then that could mean the end of the world. 
??? 
(Hm… She probably won't understand if I put it like this.) 
Well, simply put… There is a thing here in the Imperial Theater called the "Pandemonium Vessel". 
It's a very important object, so it was kept a secret to everyone except Ayame and myself. 
Do you understand? If I'd have been allowed to, I'd have told you for sure. 
Ehehe… Really? That makes me happy! 
To be honest… 
What? Go on! 
It's top secret. I was instructed not to tell anyone. 
Top secret…? 
What the enemy's after seems to be a ritual item called the Pandemonium Vessel… 
Pandemonium Vessel? 
Right now, it's all that keeps the Koma's power at bay. 
If it were to fall into their hands, then that could mean the end of the world. 
That doesn't sound good at all… So where is it? That Pandemonium Vessel, I mean. 
It's hidden somewhere here. Ayame and I were ordered to keep it safe, and its existence a secret. 
…Don't you understand? I told you everything I could. 
Chief… 
Come on… There’s some lovey-dovey stuff going on between you two, right? 
Really now, Ensign! First Ayame, and now Sakura? Make up your mind already! 
Sumire… Are you mad because you're not the center of attention for once? 
Wh-what!? 
Come on, no need to get angry. 
Come on… There’s some lovey-dovey stuff going on between you two, right? 
First Ayame, and now Sumire? Seems like no one is safe from you, Ogami… 
Indeed. It's almost impressive… 
…But it really IS strange. I think you're still hiding something from us. 
Come on… There’s some lovey-dovey stuff going on between you two, right? 
Ensign! First Ayame, and now Maria? At least make your mind up! 
Sumire… Are you mad because you're not the center of attention for once? 
Wh-what!? 
Come on, no need to get angry. 
Come on… There’s some lovey-dovey stuff going on between you two, right? 
You can't decide, huh? 
Hehe… Are you jealous, Sumire? 
I have no idea what you're talking about! 
…But it really IS strange. I think you're still hiding something from us. 
Not bad… You've really grown accustomed to dealing with children. 
Certainly… But it's not just that… 
Sumire… Are you mad because you're not the center of attention for once? 
Wh-what!? 
Come on, no need to get angry. 
So...the two of you have some chemistry between you, then? 
Really, Ensign? First Ayame, and now Kanna? Do you have trouble deciding? 
Sumire… Are you mad because you're not the center of attention for once? 
Wh-what!? 
Come on, no need to get angry. 
(Damn it… I can't say any more…) 
And… Right! I discussed the most effective way to strike at the Koma with Ayame. 
… 
I'm not lying to you! (I just omitted a few things…) 
Is that true? 
Y-yes, that's really true. (Except for the Pandemonium Vessel…) 
Ah… Sakura… But I just can't tell her the truth… 
(Damn it… I can't say any more…) 
And… Right! I discussed the most effective way to strike at the Koma with Ayame. 
… 
I'm not lying to you! (I just omitted a few things…)

Y-yes, that's really true. (Except for the Pandemonium Vessel…) 
Ah… Sumire… But I just can't tell her the truth…

Y-yes, that's really true. (Except for the Pandemonium Vessel…) 
Ah… Maria… But I just can't tell her the truth… 
(Damn it… I can't say any more…) 
And… Right! I discussed the most effective way to strike at the Koma with Ayame. 
… 
I'm not lying to you! (I just omitted a few things…) 
For real? 
Y-yes, that's really true. (Except for the Pandemonium Vessel…) 
Ah… Kohran… But I just can't tell her the truth… 
(Damn it… I can't say any more…) 
We really just talked, Ayame and I! 
… 
I'm not lying! (Well, not too much, anyway…) 
Reeeeeally? 
Yes, I swear. (I still won't tell you about the Pandemonium Vessel though…) 
Ah… Iris… But I just can't tell her the truth… 
(Damn it… I can't say any more…) 
And… Right! I discussed the most effective way to strike at the Koma with Ayame. 
… 
I'm not lying to you! (I just omitted a few things…) 
Really? 
Y-yes, that's really true. (Except for the Pandemonium Vessel…) 
Ah… Kanna… But I just can't tell her the truth… 
So you ARE hiding something? 
What is it that you can't tell me, Ensign? 
Maybe he thinks you can't keep a secret? 
Wh-what!? 
Come on, no need to get angry. 
But it IS strange, Chief. What could be so important you would lie even to poor Sakura? 
So you ARE hiding something? 
You disappoint me, Ogami… Why can't you tell us? 
Hey, no need to get angry. 
But it IS strange, Chief. What could be so important you would lie even to poor Sumire? 
So you ARE hiding something? 
What is it that you can't tell me, Ensign? 
Maybe he thinks you can't keep a secret? 
Wh-what!? 
Come on, no need to get angry. 
But it IS strange, Chief. What could be so important you would lie even to poor Maria? 
So you ARE hiding something? 
You can't even tell ME, Ensign? 
But it really IS strange. What kind of a terrible secret could it be? 
So you ARE hiding something? 
What is it that you can't tell me, Ensign? 
Maybe he thinks you can't keep a secret? 
Wh-what!? 
Come on, no need to get angry. …But it really IS strange. What kind of secret is worth telling lies over? 
So it's just as I thought, huh? 
You can't even tell ME, Ensign? 
Maybe he thinks you can't keep a secret? 
Wh-what!? 
Come on, no need to get angry. …But it really IS strange. What kind of secret is worth telling lies over? 
(A very straight, feminine posture.) 
(…) 
What's the matter with you, Ogami? Why are you staring like that? 
Oh… sorry. 
(Her black hair looks nice and silky.) 
(Long and beautiful hair… She's a true Japanese beauty.) 
(Oh dear… She's sulking.) 
(But… She's cute when she's angry.) 
…Ogami! Are you staring at anything in particular? 
(…Great, now she's angry at me.) 
(There's anger in her eyes. I guess she's serious this time.) 
What's with this strange mood all of a sudden? 
No, I… erm… 
Ogami… So you ARE hiding something! 
(I love Japanese clothes… They show off her figure nicely.) 
(But… She's at the age where certain aspects become apparent.) 
…Ogami! What are you looking at!? 
(A very straight, feminine posture.) 
(…) 
What's the matter with you, Ogami? Why are you staring like that? 
Oh… sorry. 
You looked away! So you were lying!? 
No… That's not… 
I've had enough! 
Where are you going, Ogami!? We aren't done here! 
(She's a real lady, how she pulls off those clothes…) 
(What a ravishing style.) 
What's the matter, Ensign? 
N-no, it's nothing… 
(But I must say… That's a bold outfit.) 
(*gulp*) 
Ensign! What are you looking at!? 
(Beautiful brunette hair… And perfectly styled as well.) 
(Even her hair screams "upper class". It's perfectly groomed.) 
(Sumire is a real beauty, even when she's angry.) 
(That mole… yowza!) 
What's the matter? 
Er, no… It's nothing. 
(There's anger in her eyes.) 
(She's serious… That's bad news…) 
Is it just me, or are you acting weird? 
(Er, well, it's just…) 
So… you ARE hiding something, aren't you! 
(Her hairband reminds me of that famous song…) 
(It really suits her…) 
There, you averted your eyes! That proves you were lying! 
No… That's not… 
I've had it with you! 
Where do you think you're going, Ensign? This discussion is far from over! 
(Not a single imperfection in her clothes or her posture… That's Maria for you.) 
(What a body… I love Russian women!) 
(What pretty golden hair……) 
(I guess you call that color platinum blonde.) 
(She looks somewhat tense…) 
(Is she… angry?) 
(Her eyes aren't smiling at me, that's for sure…) 
(She's angry… I think.) 
…… 
What's with this strange mood all of a sudden? 
(Er, well, it's just…) 
You're hiding something, I know it. Something you can't tell me… What a shame. 
(…Glorious…) 
(Whoa! They're big… especially if you think about how many male roles she plays.) 
… 
Can't even look me in the eye, huh? 
No… That's not… 
…I've had enough of this. 
Where do you think you're going, Ogami! We're not finished here! 
(What a slim body…) 
(She's not good at sports, is she? But she doesn't need to be, being a genius scientist and all.) 
(Chinese clothes? It really emphasizes her figure.) 
(But… This is…) 
…What's up, Chief? 
N-no, it's nothing… 
(Kohran's head. The pigtails really suit her.) 
(I wonder how she'd look with open hair.) 
(Oh dear… Kohran is really upset.) 
(Was it something I said?) 
(Her eyes look furious.) 
(She's really, really angry. Oh dear…) 
That's why you're acting all lovey-dovey? 
(Er, well, it's just…) 
So you ARE hiding something! 
Can't look me in the eye? So it was a lie! 
No… That's not… 
And here I was ready to forgive you if you told me the truth… 
Where are you going? This talk isn't over! 
(What a cute dress!) 
(She really looks like a doll.) 
(A bear plushie.) 
(He's called Jean-Paul.) 
(The size of that ribbon…) 
(You could say it's her trademark.) 
(She has beautiful blonde hair.) 
(You can't hide that she's from France.) 
(Yep, she's sulking.) 
(There's no way to cheer her up…) 
(Her big, blue eyes look at me with scorn…) 
(She seems pretty upset. I don't think I'll be able to change her mood.) 
… 
So why were you so… friendly with her? 
(Er, well, it's just…) 
You ARE hiding something… I knew it! 
Aaaah! You looked away! So it really was a lie! 
No… That's not… 
Forget it! Mon Frère, you meanie! 
Where are you going, Mon Frère? It's rude to leave in the middle of a conversation! 
(The figure of a warrior. Befitting of the successor to Kirishima Karate.) 
(She's so big, but not a gram of fat on her body… Impressive!) 
Cut it out, Chief! Didn't I tell you not to stare at me like that? 
Ah… sorry. 
(Whoa…) 
Hey, hey… What are you looking at? 
Oh, I'm sorry! 
(…) 
What…? 
No, I… I was just fascinated. 
Do you think this is the time for stuff like that? Get a grip, Chief! 
S-sorry… (She makes me feel like a naughty schoolboy.) 
(Even her hair is wild and independent.) 
(As always, with her bandana. That's part of her very own fashion style, I guess.) 
(Kanna has a stern look on her face.) 
(I guess you don't like lies either, huh?) 
Why are you staring me in the eyes like that? 
No… It's nothing. 
(Her eyes… look angry.) 
(Oh dear… I don't think she'll forgive me unless I make her understand.) 
Why has the mood gotten all weird? 
(Er, well, it's just…) 
You ARE hiding something, aren't you? 
(Even her hair is wild and independent.) 
(As always, with her bandana. That's part of her very own fashion style, I guess.) 
You looked away… So I was right! 
No… That's not… 
And I even wanted to forgive you if you just told me the truth… 
Hey, where are you going? You can't just run away like that! 
Erm… That's… 
You can't tell me? Then at least have the decency to say so! 
S-Sakura, please… 
Erm… That's… 
You can't tell me? Not even me…? I never thought you'd be so cruel… 
S-Sumire, please… 
Erm… That's… 
…It's something you can't even tell me? OK, got it! 
M-Maria, please… 
Erm… That's… 
You… You can't even tell me? OK, I've had enough! 
K-Kohran, please… 
Erm… That's… 
Mon Frère… I hate you! 
I-Iris, please… 
Erm… That's… 
…I understand now! That's just the type of person you are! 
K-Kanna, please… 
Ah… 
I'm right, aren't I? 
I really can't imagine why Ayame would take any interest in someone like you! 
Seems like you're a real challenger, Chief. 
But I really wouldn't think Ayame would accept someone like you… 
Not a doubt about it! I feel real sorry for Maria, too… 
Seems like you're a real challenger, Chief. 
Not a doubt about it! I feel real sorry for Maria, too… 
I really can't imagine why Ayame would take any interest in someone like you! 
Seems like you're a real challenger, Chief. 
But I really wouldn't think Ayame would accept someone like you… 
I really can't imagine why Ayame would take any interest in someone like you! 
I feel sorry for Kohran. 
But I really wouldn't think Ayame would accept someone like you… 
I really can't imagine why Ayame would take any interest in someone like you! 
Seems like you're a real challenger, Chief. 
But it really seems to be true. 
I really can't imagine why Ayame would take any interest in someone like you! 
Seems like you're a real challenger, Chief. 
Why… What did I… 
Where should we go? I… I don't know… 
What… What am I supposed to do…? 
What seems to be the problem? Hehehe… 
Who… are you? 
Hehehe… Me? You forgot? 
You'll soon remember… 
Huh? 
Hehehe… 
What on earth did I do…? 
…I don't know. Something made me… 
The awakening draws near. Open your eyes! 
…What happened? I… 
What's happening to me? 
Under the crimson moon, the strongest of the Koma will gain new life… 
Come! 
I… the real me… 
Who… Who am I? 
A red moon? What an ominous night. But now I should check the basement… 
I guess everything's fine downstairs… 
Hm? 
Hm? Oh, Ayame! 
…… 
Wh-what's the matter?n 
Uh… *sniff* Uh! 
Ayame! What happened? Are you okay? 
Uh… Uhhh… 
What… What happened? …Whoa! 
Whoa! …U-ugh! 
Glglglglgl… 
Ms… Ayame! …Ugh. 
Gah… Whaaaa! M-Ayame… 
Gah… ugh… can't breathe… 
Ms… Ayame… Please stop… 
Guah… *cough* 
Argh… I can't… too strong… 
Resist. <br> Call out to her. 
Gaah… *cough* 
Argh… I can't… too strong… 
Ms… Ayame… Please stop… 
Uhh… 
Hmp-hehehe… 
… 
Ayame… It's me… 
…! 
I'm… sorry… Are you OK… Ogami? I… I… 
N-no… *cough* I'm… I'm fine… Just tell me… what happened? 
Please, Ogami… Hold me… Hold me tight. 
Wha…? 
Please… right now…! 
Ask her what happened. <br> Put your arms around her. 
Ayame… What's going on? 
I don't know… I… Who… 
Huhuhu… Hehehe… 
Ayame…? …Whoa! 
Tighter… please… 
… 
Ms… Ayame… 
Uh… 
(He didn't understand how I feel… Where did you go, Ogami?) 
(He must be doing his rounds in the basement…) 
(Ensign… What are you hiding? What could it be?) 
(He must be doing his rounds in the basement…) 
(Ogami… What are you hiding from us?) 
(He must be doing his rounds in the basement…) 
(Chief… He didn't even care how I feel…) 
(He must be doing his rounds in the basement…) 
(Mon Frère… Where are you?) 
(Maybe in the underground storage room?) 
(Why would he have secrets from me?) 
(He must be doing his rounds in the basement…)

Are you OK, Ogami? 
I'm fine, don't worry! But you must give the dispatch order! Go! …I'll follow right behind you. 
B-but…! 
Please, just go! I'll explain later! 
Y-yes! 
Understood! But you have to come too! 
Yes, I'll be right behind you…

Okay, Chief! 
Please don't take too long! 
Yes, I'll be right behind you…

What! 
What's going on?

Ensign… What's going on here? 
What!? 
Captain! What on earth… 
What! 
What's going on here…?

Chief… 
Ayame! 
O-Ogami… I'm… sorry… I… 
Ayame… What on earth happened? Are you okay? 
I'm sorry, Ogami… But now, please… the enemy! 
B-but… 
Please, Ogami… Right now… I… 
Ayame… 
I'm fine, please go… 
…Yes. 
Take this, Ogami… 
But that's…! 
If… If anything should happen to me… Please don't hesitate… Use this gun to shoot me! 
What… What are you talking about!? 
…That's an order. 
An… An order? But that's… Why? 
I beg you… You're the only one who can do this for me… 
Now go, Ogami! 
A-Ayame… 
Ensign Ogami, snap out of it! Engage the enemy! 
Y-yes! 
Uh… 
No… No, no, no… 
Lord… Satan only said I should "keep you busy"… But I don't care! 
I'll show you the true power of "Deer"… by wiping out the Flower Division!

Hehehe… Just a little bit farther. 
Koma "Deer"… Are you there? 
Yes, master! 
Attack! Keep those pesky girls busy until the strongest of all Koma arrives! 
Keep them busy… Yes, consider it done! 
Hehehe… Humans! Your days in this world are counted! 
The crimson moon… then darkness… and destruction… 
How fitting as a prelude to a new world.
