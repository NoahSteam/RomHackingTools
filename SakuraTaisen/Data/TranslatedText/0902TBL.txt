It's a photo of Sakura. She's looking right at me. I wonder what she's thinking...
It's a photo of Sumire. This is a side of her you don't see too often.
It's a photo of Maria. ...She's lost in thought and looks kind of sad...
A photo of Kanna. Kanna's signature strength comes through clearly. 
A photo of Iris. She's surrounded by flowers and flashing a radiant smile.
A photo of Kohran. She's looking pretty in profile with her face dyed red by the evening sun.
A letter given to me by a patron. I was asked to give it to Sumire. I have a bad feeling about this...
Maria's pistol. This may help me escape from here...
A hair ornament. It's decorated with flowers and looks very elegant.
A brooch. It's a beautiful piece of delicate craftsmanship.
A hairpin for use in a traditional bun hairstyle. It would complement a formal outfit well.
Jean-Paul the teddy bear. Iris's best friend. She always carries him with her and takes good care of him.
This key will let me enter rooms I couldn't before.
I found this in a bedroom on the second floor. I can use it to access the back room.
A teacup Iris asked me to get for her. It has a very stylish design.
This is the matchbox Iris asked for. Its logo is quite colorful.
A knife Iris asked me to get for her. Just a normal utensil you'd use during a meal.
A prop sword and shield used onstage. They're well-made and look just like the real thing.
A prop crown used onstage. It's well-constructed and incredibly detailed.
A wig and costume used onstage. I wonder what kind of act could use a flashy outfit like this?
A photo of Sakura in her swimsuit. Wow, this is really something. I'm gonna treasure this.
A photo of Sumire in her stage costume. Her distinctive makeup really makes an impact.
It's a photo of Maria on stage in the military uniform from "For Love"... She's a beautiful woman disguised as a man. 
A photo of Kanna in her training gear. Catching her in a private moment like this feels surprisingly intimate.
A photo of Iris in her swimsuit. She's holding a rubber ring and looks ready to have some fun. How cute.
A photo of Kohran. I don't get to see her with her braids undone very often. It's a nice look.
A photo of Ayame in a traditional outfit. I hope she'll always be as happy and content as she is here.
Ayame's gun. Why...? Why did it have to turn out like this...?
Phew... Is it already this late?
A lot happened today... I should reflect on everything to get my mind in order...
The Pandemonium Vessel and the Koma.<br>The Power of Purification.<br>The Sacred Demon Castle.
The Pandemonium Vessel... So it's a key to open the Sacred Demon Castle...
And if someone with a pure heart wields it, it can defeat even the most powerful Koma...
The Koma... Monstrosities that have been at war with us humans since ancient times...
A much more formidable foe than the Black Web, that's for sure.
If they obtain the Pandemonium Vessel, they'll grow even more powerful and invade the earth.
Then even we couldn't do a thing...
We can't let them have the Pandemonium Vessel, that much is clear.
The Pandemonium Vessel...
If the Koma obtain the it, they'll grow even more powerful and invade the earth. 
We can't let them have the Pandemonium Vessel, that much is clear.
The Power of Purification...
That's the spiritual power that Sakura's dad supposedly possessed.
It's said to be passed on in the Jinguji bloodline...
But her father died before he could teach her how to use it.
The Power of Purification... huh?
The Sacred Demon Castle... The Koma's castle that was sealed away four hundred years ago.
They aim to resurrect it, above all else...
If we consider that, they'll surely come for the Pandemonium Vessel.
We have to keep that underground storage room safe at all costs.
The Sacred Demon Castle... The Koma's castle that was sealed away four hundred years ago, huh?
"Abandon the Gods"...
A writing on the Koma from ancient Japan.
It's pretty hard to understand.
The sealed land... A miracle out of the darkness... Could that have something to do with the Sacred Demon Castle?
Maria seems to have read it, too... But she didn't know about the Pandemonium Vessel.
Why did Yoneda show it to me and no one else?
Anyway, I think I have everything straight now.
Think about it some more.<br>Don't think about it.
But, wait... Something doesn't check out.
The effect of the Power of Purification.<br>Why the Pandemonium Vessel is at the Imperial Theater.<br>The Koma Wars.
The Power of Purification...
Only very few people remain of the bloodline that can wield it...
Colonel Jinguji... Sakura's father used that power to defeat the Koma.
But on the same day, he died... Is it so awesome that it takes a person's life to wield it?
The Power of Purification...
If we want to protect Teito, then we have to protect the Pandemonium Vessel.
And protecting Teito is our highest duty as the Imperial Floral Storm Troop...
Because of its properties, the Pandemonium Vessel must be closely guarded at all times. Maybe that's why it's here.
Protect the Pandemonium Vessel from the Koma... That's our mission right now.
Colonel Jinguji, Sakura's father, lost his life in the Koma Wars.
And Major Shinnosuke Kanzaki disappeared... I wonder what kind of people those two were.
The anti-demon unit fought the Koma without Spirit Armors or anything like that.
If another all-out war against the Koma breaks out...
No, there must never be a repeat of the Koma Wars.
Question is, will we be able to prevent it?
Hm? Who is it? Come in.
Ah... Sakura...
Mr. Ogami! Where have you been!?
S-Sakura... What is it?
I'm the one asking questions here. Where did you go with Ms. Ayame and what did you do?
N-no... That's...
So it's something you can't tell me?
No, it's not like that!
Then just answer me! I'm a member of the Flower Division too, you know!
What... What should I do?
Ah... Sumire...
Lieutenant! Where have you been!?
S-Sumire... What is it, all of a sudden?
I'm the one asking questions here. Where did you go with Ms. Ayame and what did were you up to?
N-no... That's...
You can't even tell me?
No, it's not like that!
Then out with it! Why would you need to hide something from me?
What... What should I do?
Ah... Maria...
Mr. Ogami...
M-Maria... What's the matter?
...Isn't there something you've been hiding from me?
N-no... That's...
Something... you just can't tell me...
No, it's... it's not what you think!
Then out with it! No excuses!
What... What should I do?
Ah... Kohran...
Boss...
K-Kohran... What's up?
...Isn't there something you've been hiding from me?
N-no... That's...
It's something... you just can't tell me, right?
No, it's... it's not what you think!
Then please tell me! I'm a member of the Flower Division, too, you know?
What... What should I do?
Ah... Iris...
Uncle Ichi...
I-Iris... What can I do for you?
...What have you been up to with auntie Ayame?
Er... nothing at all...
What have you done? Tell me!
No, it's... it's not what you think!
Then what is it? Something I mustn't know?
What... What should I do?
Ah... Kanna...
Lieutenant...
K-Kanna... What is it?
...What were you and Ms. Ayame doing?
Er... nothing at all...
...You really need to keep secrets from me?
No, it's... it's not what you think!
Then what is it!? What's so terrible that even I can't know it?
What... What should I do?
Tell the truth.<br>Tell a lie.
To be honest...
To be honest...?
It's top secret. I was instructed not to tell anyone.
...?
What the enemy's after seems to be a ritual item called the Pandemonium Vessel...
Pandemonium Vessel?
Right now, it's all that keeps the Koma's power at bay.
If it were to fall into their hands, then that could mean the end of the world.
...What!? And where is this Pandemonium Vessel?
It's hidden somewhere in the Imperial Theater. Ms. Ayame and I were ordered to keep it safe, and its existence a secret.
...Don't you understand? I told you everything I could.
Mr. Ogami...
(Sakura doesn't know...)
(That her father... gave his life...)
Mr. Ogami?
(If she knew, then... I'm sure, she'd...)
(She must not know...)
Sakura...
...?
I promise I'll protect you and the rest of the Flower Division...
Mr... Mr. Ogami...
And we'll fight the Koma together!
...Yes!
To be honest...
To be honest...?
It's top secret. I was instructed not to tell anyone.
Top secret...?
What the enemy's after seems to be a ritual item called the Pandemonium Vessel...
Pandemonium Vessel?
Right now, it's all that keeps the Koma's power at bay.
If it were to fall into their hands, then that could mean the end of the world.
Wh-what!? And where on earth is this infernal device?
It's hidden somewhere in the Imperial Theater. Ms. Ayame and I were ordered to keep it safe, and its existence a secret.
...Don't you understand? I told you everything I could.
Lieutenant...
To be honest...
...?
It's top secret. I was instructed not to tell anyone.
Top secret...?
What the enemy's after seems to be a ritual item called the Pandemonium Vessel...
Pandemonium Vessel?
(I see... So even Maria wasn't let in on the Pandemonium Vessel...)
Right now, it's all that keeps the Koma's power at bay.
If it were to fall into their hands, then that could mean the end of the world.
And where on earth is this Pandemonium Vessel?
It's hidden somewhere in the Imperial Theater. Ms. Ayame and I were ordered to keep it safe, and its existence a secret.
...Don't you understand? I told you everything I could.
Mr. Ogami... If it's top secret, can you really tell me?
That's much better than if you got the wrong idea...
Ogami...
To be honest...
Yes...?
It's top secret. I was instructed not to tell anyone.
Top secret...?
What the enemy's after seems to be a ritual item called the Pandemonium Vessel...
The Pandemonium Vessel...
Right now, it's all that keeps the Koma's power at bay.
If it were to fall into their hands, then that could mean the end of the world.
Wait a second! And where is that Pandemonium Vessel thing?
It's hidden somewhere in the Imperial Theater. Ms. Ayame and I were ordered to keep it safe, and its existence a secret.
...Don't you understand? I told you everything I could.
Boss...
To be honest...
Yes...?
It's top secret. I was instructed not to tell anyone.
Top secret... What's that mean?
What the enemy's after seems to be a ritual item called the Pandemonium Vessel...
Demon what?
Right now, it's all that keeps the Koma's power at bay.
If it were to fall into their hands, then that could mean the end of the world.
???
(Hm... She probably won't understand if I put it like this.)
Well, simply put... There is a thing here in the Imperial Theater called the "Pandemonium Vessel".
It's a very important object, so it was kept a secret to everyone except Ms. Ayame and myself.
Do you understand? If I'd have been allowed to, I'd have told you for sure.
Ehehe... Really? That makes me happy!
To be honest...
What? Go on!
It's top secret. I was instructed not to tell anyone.
Top secret...?
What the enemy's after seems to be a ritual item called the Pandemonium Vessel...
Pandemonium Vessel?
Right now, it's all that keeps the Koma's power at bay.
If it were to fall into their hands, then that could mean the end of the world.
That doesn't sound good at all... So where is it? That Pandemonium Vessel, I mean.
It's hidden somewhere in the Imperial Theater. Ms. Ayame and I were ordered to keep it safe, and its existence a secret.
...Don't you understand? I told you everything I could.
Commander...
Come on... It's a nice mood, isn't it?
Really now, Lieutenant! First Ms. Ayame, and now Ms. Sakura? Make up your mind already!
Sumire... Are you mad because you're not the center of attention for once?
Wh-what!?
Come on, no need to get angry.
Come on... It's a nice mood, isn't it?
First Ms. Ayame, and now Ms. Sumire? Seems like no one is safe from you, Mr. Ogami...
Indeed. It's almost impressive...
...But it really IS strange. I think you're still hiding something from us.
Come on... It's a nice mood, isn't it?
Lieutenant! First Ayame, and now Maria? At least make your mind up!
Sumire... Are you mad because you're not the center of attention for once?
Wh-what!?
Come on, no need to get angry.
Come on... It's a nice mood, isn't it?
You can't decide, huh?
Hihi... Are you jealous, Sumire?
I have no idea what you're talking about!
...But it really IS strange. I think you're still hiding something from us.
Not bad... You've really grown accustomed to dealing with children.
Certainly... But it's not just that...
Sumire... Are you mad because you're not the center of attention for once?
Wh-what!?
Come on, no need to get angry.
This is... a nice mood, isn't it?
Really, Lieutenant? First Ayame, and now Kanna? Do you have trouble deciding?
Sumire... Are you mad because you're not the center of attention for once?
Wh-what!?
Come on, no need to get angry.
(Damn it... I can't say any more...)
And... Right! I discussed the most effective way to strike at the Koma with Ms. Ayame.
...
I'm not lying to you! (I just omitted a few things...)
Is that true?
Y-yes, that's really true. (Except for the Pandemonium Vessel...)
Ah... Sakura... But I just can't tell her the truth...
(Damn it... I can't say any more...)
And... Right! I discussed the most effective way to strike at the Koma with Ms. Ayame.

And... Right! I discussed the most effective way to strike at the Koma with Ms. Ayame.
...
I'm not lying to you! (I just omitted a few things...)
For real?
Y-yes, that's really true. (Except for the Pandemonium Vessel...)
Ah... Kohran... But I just can't tell her the truth...
(Damn it... I can't say any more...)
We really just talked, Ayame and I!
...
I'm not lying! (Well, not too much, anyway...)
Reeeeeally?
Yes, I swear. (I still won't tell you about the Pandemonium Vessel though...)
Ah... Iris... But I just can't tell her the truth...
(Damn it... I can't say any more...)
And... Right! I discussed the most effective way to strike at the Koma with Ms. Ayame.
...
I'm not lying to you! (I just omitted a few things...)
Really?
Y-yes, that's really true. (Except for the Pandemonium Vessel...)
Ah... Kanna... But I just can't tell her the truth...
So you ARE hiding something?
What is it that you can't tell me, Lieutenant?
Maybe he thinks you can't keep a secret?
Wh-what!?
Come on, no need to get angry.
But it IS strange, boss. What could be so important you would lie even to poor Sakura?
So you ARE hiding something?
You disappoint me, Mr. Ogami... Why can't you tell us?
Hey, no need to get angry.
But it IS strange, boss. What could be so important you would lie even to poor Sumire?
So you ARE hiding something?
What is it that you can't tell me, Lieutenant?
Maybe he thinks you can't keep a secret?
Wh-what!?
Come on, no need to get angry.
But it IS strange, boss. What could be so important you would lie even to poor Maria?
So you ARE hiding something?
You can't even tell ME, Lieutenant?
But it really IS strange. What kind of a terrible secret could it be?
So you ARE hiding something?
What is it that you can't tell me, Lieutenant?
Maybe he thinks you can't keep a secret?
Wh-what!?
Come on, no need to get angry. ...But it really IS strange. What kind of secret is worth telling lies over?
So it's just as I thought, huh?
You can't even tell ME, Lieutenant?
Maybe he thinks you can't keep a secret?
Wh-what!?
Come on, no need to get angry. ...But it really IS strange. What kind of secret is worth telling lies over?
(A very straight, feminine posture.)
(...)
What's the matter with you, Mr. Ogami? Why are you staring like that?
Oh... sorry.
(Her black hair looks nice and silky.)
(Long and beautiful hair... She's a true Japanese beauty.)
(Oh dear... She's sulking.)
(But... She's cute when she's angry.)
...Mr. Ogami! Are you staring at anything in particular?
(...Great, now she's angry at me.)
(There's anger in her eyes. I guess she's serious this time.)
What's with this strange mood all of a sudden?
No, I... erm...
Mr. Ogami... So you ARE hiding something!
(I love Japanese clothes... They show off her figure nicely.)
(But... She's at the age where certain parts just become apparent.)
...Mr. Ogami! What are you looking at!?
(A very straight, feminine posture.)
(...)
What's the matter with you, Mr. Ogami? Why are you staring like that?
Oh... sorry.
You looked away! So you were lying!?
No... That's not...
I've had enough!
Where are you going, Mr. Ogami!? We aren't done here!
(She's a real lady, how she pulls off those clothes...)
(What a ravishing style.)
What's the matter, Lieutenant?
N-no, it's nothing...
(But I must say... That's a bold outfit.)
(*gulp*)
Lieutenant! What are you looking at!?
(Beautiful brunette hair... And perfectly styled as well.)
(Even her hair screams "upper class". It's perfectly groomed.)
(Sumire is a real beauty, even when she's angry.)
(That mole... yowza!)
What's the matter?
Er, no... It's nothing.
(There's anger in her eyes.)
(She's serious... That's bad news...)
Is it just me, or are you acting weird?
(Er, well, it's just...)
So... you ARE hiding something, aren't you!
(Her hairband reminds me of that famous song...)
(It really suits her...)
There, you averted your eyes! That proves you were lying!
No... That's not...
I've had it with you!
Where do you think you're going, Lieutenant? This discussion is far from over!
(Not a single imperfection in her clothes or her posture... That's Maria for you.)
(What a body... I love Russian women!)
(What pretty golden hair......)
(I guess you call that color platinum blonde.)
(She looks somewhat tense...)
(Is she... angry?)
(Her eyes aren't smiling at me, that's for sure...)
(She's angry... I think.)
......
What's with this strange mood all of a sudden?
(Er, well, it's just...)
You're hiding something, I know it. Something you can't tell me... What a shame.
(...Glorious...)
(Whoa! They're big... especially if you think about how many male roles she plays.)
...
Can't even look me in the eye, huh?
No... That's not...
...I've had enough of this.
Where do you think you're going, Mr. Ogami! We're not finished here!
(What a slim body...)
(She's not good at sports, is she? But she doesn't need to be, being a genius scientist and all.)
(Chinese clothes? It really emphasizes her figure.)
(But... This is...)
...What's up, boss?
N-no, it's nothing...
(Kohran's head. The pigtails really suit her.)
(I wonder how she'd look with open hair.)
(Oh dear... Kohran is really upset.)
(Was it something I said?)
(Her eyes look furious.)
(She's really, really angry. Oh dear...)
That's why you're acting all lovey-dovey?
(Er, well, it's just...)
So you ARE hiding something!
Can't look me in the eye? So it was a lie!
No... That's not...
And here I was ready to forgive you if you told me the truth...
Where are you going? This talk isn't over!
(What a cute dress!)
(She really looks like a doll.)
(A bear plushie.)
(He's called Jean-Paul.)
(The size of that ribbon...)
(You could say it's her trademark.)
(She has beautiful blonde hair.)
(You can't hide that she's from France.)
(Yep, she's sulking.)
(There's no way to cheer her up...)
(Her big, blue eyes look at me with scorn...)
(She seems pretty upset. I don't think I'll be able to change her mood.)
...
So why were you so... friendly with her?
(Er, well, it's just...)
You ARE hiding something... I knew it!
Aaaah! You looked away! So it really was a lie!
No... That's not...
Forget it! Uncle Ichi, you meanie!
Where are you going, uncle Ichi? It's rude to leave in the middle of a conversation!
(The figure of a warrior. Befitting of the successor to Kirishima Karate.)
(She's so big, but not a gram of fat on her body... Impressive!)
Cut it out, commander! Didn't I tell you not to stare at me like that?
Ah... sorry.
(Whoa...)
Hey, hey... What are you looking at?
Oh, I'm sorry!
(...)
What...?
No, I... I was just fascinated.
Do you think this is the time for stuff like that? Get a grip, commander!
S-sorry... (She makes me feel like a naughty schoolboy.)
(Even her hair is wild and independent.)
(As always, with her bandana. That's part of her very own fashion style, I guess.)
(Kanna has a stern look on her face.)
(I guess you don't like lies either, huh?)
Why are you staring me in the eyes like that?
No... It's nothing.
(Her eyes... look angry.)
(Oh dear... I don't think she'll forgive me unless I make her understand.)
Why has the mood gotten all weird?
(Er, well, it's just...)
You ARE hiding something, aren't you?
(Even her hair is wild and independent.)
(As always, with her bandana. That's part of her very own fashion style, I guess.)
You looked away... So I was right!
No... That's not...
And I even wanted to forgive you if you just told me the truth...
Hey, where are you going? You can't just run away like that!
Erm... That's...
You can't tell me? Then at least have the decency to say so!
S-Sakura, please...
Erm... That's...
You can't tell me? Not even me...? I never thought you'd be so cruel...
S-Sumire, please...
Erm... That's...
...It's something you can't even tell me? OK, got it!
M-Maria, please...
Erm... That's...
You... You can't even tell me? OK, I've had enough!
K-Kohran, please...
Erm... That's...
Uncle Ichi... I hate you!
I-Iris, please...
Erm... That's...
...I understand now! That's just the type of person you are!
K-Kanna, please...
Ah...
I'm right, aren't I?
I really can't imagine why Ms. Ayame would take any interest in someone like you!
Seems like you're a real challenger, boss.
But I really wouldn't think Ms. Ayame would accept someone like you...
Not a doubt about it! I feel real sorry for Maria, too...
Seems like you're a real challenger, boss.

But it really seems to be true.
I really can't imagine why Ms. Ayame would take any interest in someone like you!
Seems like you're a real challenger, boss.
Why... What did I...
Where should we go? I... I don't know...
What... What am I supposed to do...?
What seems to be the problem? Hihihi...
Who... are you?
Hihihi... Me? You forgot?
You'll soon remember...
Huh?
Hihihi...
What on earth did I do...?
...I don't know. Something made me...
The awakening draws near. Open your eyes!
...What happened? I...
What's happening to me?
Under the crimson moon, the strongest of the Koma will gain new life...
Come!
I... the real me...
Who... Who am I?
A red moon? What an ominous night. But now I should check the basement...
I guess everything's fine downstairs...
Hm?
Hm? Oh, Ms. Ayame!
......
Wh-what's the matter?n
Uh... *sniff* Uh!
Ms. Ayame! What happened? Are you okay?
Uh... Uhhh...
What... What happened? ...Whoa!
Whoa! ...U-ugh!
Glglglglgl...
Ms... Ms. Ayame! ...Ugh.
Gah... Whaaaa! M-Ms. Ayame...
Gah... ugh... can't breathe...
Ms... Ayame... Please stop...
Guah... *cough*
Argh... I can't... too strong...
Resist.<br>Call out to her.
Gaah... *cough*
Argh... I can't... too strong...
Ms... Ayame... Please stop...
Uhh...
Hmphihihi...
...
Ms. Ayame... It's me...
...!
I'm... sorry... Are you OK... Ogami? I... I...
N-no... *cough* I'm... I'm fine... Just tell me... what happened?
Please, Ogami... Hold me... Hold me tight.
Wha...?
Please... right now...!
Ask her what happened.<br>Put your arms around her.
Ms. Ayame... What's going on?
I don't know... I... Who...
Huhuhu... Hehehe...
Ms. Ayame...? ...Whoa!
Tighter... please...
...
Ms... Ms. Ayame...
Uh...
(He didn't understand how I feel... Where did you go, Mr. Ogami?)
(He must be doing his rounds in the basement...)
(Lieutenant... What are you hiding? What could it be?)
(He must be doing his rounds in the basement...)
(Mr. Ogami... What are you hiding from us?)
(He must be doing his rounds in the basement...)
(Boss... He didn't even care how I feel...)
(He must be doing his rounds in the basement...)
(Uncle Ichi... Where are you?)
(Maybe in the underground storage room?)
(Why would he have secrets from me?)
(He must be doing his rounds in the basement...)
Huh! What!?
Mr. Ogami!
Lieutenant!?n
Lieutenant!?
Huh! What!?
Mr. Ogami!
Wh-what!?
Boss!
What's...!?
Uncle Ichi!
Wh-what!?
Commander!
Guahaha...
Ms. Ayame! Please stop!
...Uhhh.
Gah... *cough, cough*
Are you OK, Mr. Ogami?
I'm fine, don't worry! But you must give the dispatch order! Go! ...I'll follow right behind you.
B-but...!
Please, just go! I'll explain later!
Y-yes!
Understood! But you have to come too!
Yes, I'll be right behind you...
(Ms. Ayame... The underground storage room? But... why?)
Guahaha...
Ms. Ayame! Stop it, will you!
...Uhhh.
Gah... *cough, cough*
Are you OK, Lieutenant?
I'm fine, don't worry! But you must give the dispatch order! Go! ...I'll follow right behind you.

Please, just go! I'll explain later!
Y-yes!
Understood, but you have to come too!
Yes, I'll be right behind you...
(Ms. Ayame... The underground storage room? But... why?)
Guahaha...
Ms. Ayame! What're you doing?!
...Uhhh.
Gah... *cough, cough*
Everything all right, boss?
I'm fine, don't worry! But you must give the dispatch order! Go! ...I'll follow right behind you.
B-but...!
Please, just go! I'll explain later!
Okay, boss!
Please don't take too long!
Yes, I'll be right behind you...
(Ms. Ayame... The underground storage room? But... why?)
Guahaha...
Auntie Ayame! What are you doing?
...Uhhh.
Gah... *cough, cough*
Are you OK, uncle Ichi?
I'm fine, don't worry! But you must give the dispatch order! Go! ...I'll follow right behind you.
B-but...!
Please, just go! I'll explain later!
O-okay!
Please hurry, uncle Ichi!
Yes, I'll be right behind you...
(Ms. Ayame... The underground storage room? But... why?)
Guahaha...
Ms. Ayame! What are you doing?
...Uhhh.
Gah... *cough, cough*
Are you OK, commander?
I'm fine, don't worry! But you must give the dispatch order! Go! ...I'll follow right behind you.
B-but...!
Please, just go! I'll explain later!
Y-yes!
Hurry, commander!
Yes, I'll be right behind you...
(Ms. Ayame... The underground storage room? But... why?)
What!
What's going on?
What!
Lieutenant... What's going on here?
What!?
Commander! What on earth...
What!
What's going on here...?
What!?
Uncle Ichi...
What!?
What's going on here?
Oh! The enemy!...

Mr. Ogami...
Oh! The enemy!...

Lieutenant...
Oh! The enemy!...

Commander...
Oh! The enemy!...

Boss...
Oh! The enemy!...

Uncle Ichi...
Oh! The enemy!...

Commander...
Ms. Ayame!
O-Ogami... I'm... sorry... I...
Ms. Ayame... What on earth happened? Are you okay?
I'm sorry, Ogami... But now, please... the enemy!
B-but...
Please, Ogami... Right now... I...
Ms. Ayame...
I'm fine, please go...
...Yes.
Take this, Ogami...
But that's...!
If... If anything should happen to me... Please don't hesitate... Use this gun to shoot me!
What... What are you talking about!?
...That's an order.
An... An order? But that's... Why?
I beg you... You're the only one who can do this for me...
Now go, Ogami!
A-Ayame...
Lieutenant Ogami, snap out of it! Engage the enemy!
Y-yes!
Uh...
No... No, no, no...
Lord　Satan only said I should "keep you busy"... But I don't care!
I'll show you the true power of "Deer"... by wiping out the Flower Division!
Lord Satan! I have gathered the elite of the Koma!
The time has come for you to roam the surface!
Destroy! Annihilate! Extinguish everything! Ah, how beautiful it will be!
And after everything is dead and gone, new life will be born!
Destruction is only the prelude to new life!
On the night of the crimson moon, the strongest of all Koma will be born again...
And they will join us in our extasy of extermination!
Koma "Deer"!
Yes, master!
You will buy us the time we need.
As you command.
And don't do anything stupid, like seeking revenge for "Boar"!
Yes...
I will prove to you that I am the strongest of all, Lord Satan...
That man... Aoi Satan... Maybe his true goal is the Pandemonium Insignia.
The Pandemonium Insignia are the key to the gates of the Sacred Demon Castle.
They're in our possession right now.
No one except me and Ayame can open this vault.
That's why we can expect him to attack us! So be ready!
It's a castle that was built hundreds of years ago to bring death and destruction to the world.
We can't allow it to appear on the face of the earth!
Even among the military, this is highly classified information. Don't talk to anyone about it.
The treasure is almost in our grasp!
Be careful, this place is riddled with traps! Take each step exactly like I'll show you!
Yes, OK.
First three steps to the left, then four to the right and seven straight ahead...
...Is a path you absolutely shouldn't take.
Hihihi... Just a little bit farther.
Koma "Deer"... Are you there?
Yes, master!
Attack! Keep those pesky girls busy until the strongest of all Koma arrives!
Keep them busy... Yes, consider it done!
Hihihi... Humans! Your days in this world are counted!
The crimson moon... then darkness... and destruction...
How fitting as a prelude to a new world.
Hmph! Bunch of worthless worms...
I suppose it is time to awaken him...

Ayame!

Hihihi...
That's...
Waah!
Ms... Ms. Ayame...
Hihi... Muahaha... Time to hand over the Pandemonium Vessel...
The Pandemonium Vessel!
Come, Ayame... Come to me!
Y-yes...
Ogami! Please... You have to shoot me!
Please, shoot me now! This is an order, Ogami!
Mr. Ogami... Don't shoot!
Please be yourself... The real Ogami.
Mr. Ogami...
Ogami...
Hihihi... How ironic that the seal cast upon me would also be the strongest of all...
Remember, Ayame... Remember the lost paradise...
Ogami!
Ayame!
Whatcha doing?!
It's... all... right... Ogami.
Hihihihi... Ichiro Ogami. Your calm judgment, your quick actions, your courage... All worthy of praise.
But all that will be in vain... It will be my greatest pleasure to pluck the seed of hope from your dirt...
Foolish humans! I hope you enjoy the bitter taste of despair!
Behold... this!
Hihihi... This is the strongest of all Koma, the one closest to me... And his helper...
The murderess has awakened!
Yes... the two of us are one. Our vow from the last life will finally be fulfilled...
Hi...
Tonight's fated meeting... We will conquer everything and create a demonic paradise...
Hihihi...
And this is the key we sought. Please accept the Pandemonium Vessel.
Aaaah!!
Muahaha... Only pain and desperation await you...
Come... sweet ruin...
The Ayame you knew is already dead.
She died by that gun you're holding right now. Aaaahahahaha!
Your precious Ayame is gone... Along with the crimson moon!
Untranslated
At last, it will return to this world... the Sacred Demon Castle!
Hahaha!
Commander...
You think I'm depressed!? Ha! Ridiculous!
What do I care if one or two women like that die?
Huh...
Difficult?! You talk just like them, commander!
Hmph!
Untranslated
I'll be going!
How... How could you say something like that!?
You... who knows us better than anyone else!
Every day we must fight! Kill, kill, kill!
Untranslated
Untranslated
Who made me what I am? Wasn't it Ms. Ayame!? Certainly not you lot!
But even though... She just double-crossed us...
Untranslated
Call me childish, but I can't see any good in Ms. Ayame even if I tried.
!
I'm sorry... commander... Please leave me be... for a second...
Auntie Ayame...n
I've calmed down a bit...
Untranslated
Untranslated
Mr. Ogami... You liked Ms. Ayame, right?
But... It didn't look like that to me.
As for me... I liked her a lot. I always strove to become a person just like her.
Untranslated
Sorry... I'm sure I don't make sense...
Untranslated
That's it! Ms. Ayame must simply be under Satan's control!
We have to save her! The Imperial Floral Storm Troop wouldn't be the same without her!
Thank you, Mr. Ogami.
I... I liked her a lot, too. She was a big inspiration.
I could only dream of becoming like her one day...
But everything's changed now! I've grown a lot stronger since then.
Come on, Mr. Ogami! Let's save Ms. Ayame!
Untranslated
Muahahaha... The castle that will fulfill all my ambitions is about to return. Murderess!
Yes.
Untranslated
Yes, master!
Show me what you can do.
Please wait.
Untranslated
Untranslated
Hmph... Very well. As you please...
Untranslated
Hahaha!
Why are you laughing?
Untranslated
I will fulfill my ambition together with Lord Satan... I won't allow you to interfere!
Captain! We have no time to lose! Let's dispatch to Tokyo Bay immediately!
Check it out, the fog has cleared up. It'll be morning soon...There's no such thing as a night that lasts forever!
Yeah! Just look at that!!
W-what the heck?!
Aah...aaah!!
Guaaah! T-that's...
Seima Castle...
Behold! Here lies Yamato, the phantom realm that was erased from history!
You are too late to thwart my ambitions. I am the true ruler! Satan, Lord of Heaven!
Degeneration, anger, despair! Come to me now...
The new capital shall be here in Yamato!
Huhuhuhu...Hu...Hahaha...Aaaahahahahahaha...
Untranslated
Untranslated
Why? Why you, Ms. Ayame... After we've fought together, side by side!
We can't throw in the towel just yet. This fight is only just beginning!
But... What are you saying!? This isn't like you at all, Mr. Ogami!
Untranslated
Please cheer up!
Untranslated
Hm? Lieutenant...?
Untranslated
Untranslated
If I'd just been stronger, then... All of this wouldn't have happened.
Untranslated
You can stop trying to make me feel better, commander. I've failed, that's a fact.
Untranslated
So... What are you saying?
Untranslated
I'm pretty sure you'll grow tired of being around me soon enough...
Huh?
Cut it out... This isn't like you.
Really.
Yes... I guess you're right...
Commander...
Thank you.
Having someone to lean on at a time like this... That's priceless.
Untranslated
Ms. Ayame... that such a thing could happen to her...
Untranslated
There's no one there...
Sakura... Kasumi...
Everyone's gone. Just like auntie Ayame... Everyone...
Uncle Ichi... You won't leave me, right? Promise you'll never leave me!
I don't want to be alone! I would die!
Uncle Ichi...
I just... I don't want to be alone...
Untranslated
That you'll always... be there?
Untranslated
You know me... I can't do anything right.
I can't shoot a gun like Maria, and I'm not strong like Kanna.
*sniff* The only thing I'm even remotely good is tinkering with stuff.
Untranslated
Untranslated
Untranslated
Untranslated
Can you tell me that, boss?
*sniff* Really?
You're right... Gotta keep smiling! Nothing good's ever come of moping.
Thanks, boss. I should head back to my room and get some shut-eye.
OK, commander... Good night.
Untranslated
Untranslated
No, no... A lie is better than nothing. I really like you, boss!
OK... I should probably head back to my room.
B-boss...
It doesn't matter...
That... That'd be too much. I can't ask that of you, boss...
Untranslated
That's... Boss... So you remembered?
Boss...
Yeah...
Boss...
Of course... If I could fly with you, you can't imagine how much I'd...
*sniff* It's funny, really...
Just being here with you like this... I already feel so much better. I wonder why that is...
Ah... Commander...
Out of everyone in the Flower Division, I've known Ms. Ayame the longest.
I first met her four years ago in America.
Untranslated
Untranslated
Even back then, she was always fighting for others.
What a sad life...
Untranslated
Untranslated
Untranslated
No... Not at all!
Commander... No, I should say Mr. Ogami... You're always fighting for the Flower Division and the people of this city...
Untranslated
I'll fight alongside you, for this city. That's all that counts for now.
Yes, but...
Please forget what I said...
Please forget what I said...
I think I'll follow your advice... I'll rest for a bit.
Untranslated
Untranslated
Until now... No, until you were here, Mr. Ogami...
Hihi... Ms. Ayame always was the only one I could talk with about these things.
