You've grown strong… It seems like I didn't misjudge you.
Hehehe, but still…
That's it? This is how determined… How strong you are?
Are you that afraid of hurting me?
What a sweet child you are… Just you wait, I'll make the pain go away…
Tonight, the Spirit Cannon will fire… The world will be drenched in darkness… Look!
Ayame, please! Return to the person you were!
Your bloody tears are wine, your lamentations are music, your despair is the bell that announces our time has come.
Billions of lives in despair and fear… They intoxicate us… me and Lord Satan.
Mon Frère!
Yes!
Ogami…
Ensign…
Chief…
Boss…
Sir!
Mon Frère…
Ogami… You have to win… You have to…
Ogami… If you lose… I won't forgive you…
Captain… You have to win… You have to…
I thought it might come to this, so… I prepared a little something for you, chief…
Mon Frère… You can't lose… You can't!
Sir… You have to win… Please…
Impossible! The likes of you could never beat me…!
No! I won't have this!!
Hehehe… I'll release all of the castle's power at once!
Fear will rain down on the whole world!
Goodbye, Imperial Assault Troupe! It looks like… you lost in the end!
You'll pay for all of the sins humans have committed!
Let's go, Captain.
What's with that blank face?!
Hoooohohoho! Sumire Kanzaki, heroine of the century, returns in style!
I'm here too!
Mon Frère! I'm here as well!
Let's go! This is our last battle!
I'm with you!
Let's go! This is our last battle!
Let's go! This is our last battle!
Let's go! This is our last battle!
Let's go! This is our last battle!
Let's go, Mon Frère!
Roger!
Behold! This is my god-machine… God's menace… Kamoi!
It will smash your insects to dust!
Let's go! As long as we're in the capital…
Evil will not triumph!
All or nothing, as long as we have any strength left!
We will gladly give our lives!
To ensure this world has a future!
The Imperial Assault Troupe… has arrived!
The Imperial Assault Troupe… has arrived!
The Imperial Assault Troupe… has arrived!
The Imperial Assault Troupe… has arrived!
The Imperial Assault Troupe… has arrived!
The Imperial Assault Troupe… has arrived!
Grugh… H-haaa…!
Goodbye… Ogami.
Not bad… Come on then! I want you to be the one to finish me off!
Here we go, Ogami!
Go back to normal!<br>Satan is using you!
Miss Ayame, please go back to normal!
The Ayame you knew is dead… She died along with that red moon!
The Ayame you knew is dead… She died by your gun!
Miss Ayame! Can't you see Satan is using you?!
Hehehehe… You're the ones who were being used. I have been the Kouma Aya-me all along…
There never was any Ayame Fujieda…
…
Hehehe… Cat got your tongue?
Guah!
Ogami!
Ensign!
Boss!
Sir!
Chief!
Mon Frère!
Stay away! Please… don't touch me.
Hehehe…
I don't wanna fight you.<br>No, the real Ayame…
I don't want to fight you. My goal is to defeat Satan. Stay back, Ayame!
I told you I won't let you get in Lord Satan's way. Don't you see it's foolish to oppose us?
No! The real Ayame always stood by us when we were in trouble.
And I always admired that about you.
Humans are pathetic beings.
Even though I'm telling you Ayame is dead, you cling to those memories of the past…
If you love that Ayame Fujieda so much, I'll send you to join her in her eternal slumber!
Ayame…
Why do you hesitate?
Guah!
Oh no! Ogami will…
Oh no! The Ensign will…
Oh no! The captain will…
Oh no! The chief will…
Oh no! The captain will…
Oh no! Mon Frère will…
Miss Ayame, please stop!<br>Why are you doing this?
Miss Ayame, please stop!
What's the matter? Tonight will be a ball just for the two of us… A joyous banquet of blood…
Why… Why are you doing this? Do you really wish for the world to be destroyed?!
Hehehe… Exactly. Meeting him has really changed my outlook.
Envy… Fear… Malice… All the negative emotions in this world give me power.
…
Hehehe… It seems you finally understand.
Guah!
That's it? This is how determined… How strong you are?
Are you that afraid of hurting me?
What a sweet child you are… Just you wait, I'll make the pain go away…
Tonight, the Spirit Cannon will fire… The world will be drenched in darkness… Look!
Ayame, please! Return to the person you were!
Ayame, I beg of you! Return to the person you were!
Ayame, please! Return to the person you were!
Ayame, please! Go back to the Ayame we know and love!
Ayame, please! Return to the person you were!
Auntie Ayame, please! Go back to normal!
Your tears are my wine, your lamentations are my music, your despair is the bell that announces our coming.
Billions of lives in despair and fear… They intoxicate us… me and Lord Satan.
Hmph!
Goodbye… Ogami.
What are you doing…
All right, Sakura…
All right, Sumire…
All right, Maria…
All right, Kohran…
All right, Kanna…
All right, Iris…
Humans… They tend to do such peculiar things sometimes…
My old self might even have done the same…
Wh-What is this… this power?!
The thing is, Ayame…
Even if you've become evil incarnate… You were always special to me…
Even if the world is destroyed and everything’s lost, I just want to have you back… That's how part of me felt…
But everyone here, and you… You taught me one thing.
There are times when we must not give up! Times when we must cast everything aside and fight on!
I see it clearly now!
Take a good look, Sakura.
Take a good look, Sumire.
Take a good look, Maria.
Take a good look, Kohran.
Take a good look, Kanna.
Take a good look, Iris.
Yes!
Yes…
Yes.
Alrighty…
Yes.
OK…
Hehehe… Looks like I underestimated you. I won't hold back anymore.
We did it…!
We did it…!
We did it…!
We did it…!
We did it…!
We did it…!
Gah…
Ogami?!
Ensign?!
Boss?!
Chief?!
Sir?!
Mon Frère?!
Finish her
Ayame…
Hehehe…
Cerulean Satan! Prepare to feel the crushing blow of justice!
Hehehehe… You kill your former ally and call that justice? Absurd!
I'll send you all to hell… And there, you can apologize to Aya-me!
…
Ogami…
Ensign…
Boss…
Chief…
Sir…
Mon Frère…
Why don't you finish me off?! This might be your only chance to defeat me!
I don't know… but…
I still can't bring myself to defeat you…
What a weird one you are… I told you your dear Ayame Fujieda doesn't exist anymore…
Aya-me! Stop this charade!
Satan?!
Lord Satan?!
Be gone, insects!
Whoaaaaaa!
A-Ayame?!
…
Ayameeeeee!!
This is a farce… What a foolish woman you are…
We won't forgive you, Cerulean Satan… The Imperial Assault Troupe will deal you the crushing blow of justice!
Hahahahaha! You're one to speak, after being helped by your enemy!
Don't worry… I'll send you all to hell, where Aya-me is already waiting for you…
I'm fine now. Let's defeat Satan together, Ogami!
Sakura! …OK, let's do this!
I'm fine now. Let's defeat Satan together, Ensign!
Sumire! …OK, let's do this!
I'm fine now. Let's defeat Satan, Captain!
Maria! …OK, let's do this!
I'm fine now. Let's defeat that a-hole together, Boss!
Kanna! …OK, let's do this!
I'm fine now. Let's defeat Satan together, Chief!
Kohran! …OK, let's do this!
I'm fine now. Let's give that guy a beating, Mon Frère!
Iris! …OK, let's do this!
The world will be gone in just a few moments! Your lives, your struggle, your deaths will all be meaningless!
Hahahaha…
What… are you trying to do?
Stop it!
All of you…!
…!
Aaaah!
Let's go, everyone! We have just one choice left now!
Imperial Assault Troupe, go!
Imperial Assault Troupe, go!
Let's gooo! As long as we're here…
Evil will not triumph!
All or nothing, as long as we have any strength left!
Flower Blizzard!
To ensure this world has a future!
Ogami… don't give up.
Ensign… I won't forgive you if you lose.
Boss… Please fight with all your strength.
Chief… you can't give up now!
Mon Frère… do your best!
Sir… you can't lose now!
If we combine our strength, we can defeat Satan!
If we stand together, we can win against Satan!
If we combine our strength, we can defeat any foe!
If we work together, that Satan guy is toast!
You and me, Mon Frère… Together we're super powerful!
If we work together, we can take Satan, no problem!
Take a good look, everyone!
Sakura… I'll protect you, I swear!
Sumire… I'll always protect you!
Maria… I've got your back.
I'll always protect you, Iris!
I'll protect you, Kohran! Don't you worry!
Kanna! Leave the defense to me!
I need to focus!
I'm moving out!
Leave it to me!!
Watch this, Ogami.
I-I'm OK…
Thank you!
Get them, Ogami!
I'm counting on you, Ogami!
Kyaaa!
Y-You've not seen the last of me!
Ogami… I'm sorry…
It's my turn now.
Hahahaha…
I'm moving out!!
Today's performance is just for you!
It'll take more than that to bring me down…
Ensign… so you really do care…
Now, Ensign, make your move!
I'll be keeping my eyes on you!
Uwahhh!!
I suppose I'll let you win for now!
The captain needs me!!
I'll have to take down the enemies myself!
Where's my next target!?
Whoever wants to die first, just step forward…
I'll be relying on your orders, sir!
I'm not finished yet!! Not yet!!
You're doing that… just for me?
Focus, sir!
We'll make it out of this alive!
Ahhh…
They're too strong!! I need to withdraw!!
Forgive me, sir. I need to withdraw!
I can fight too!
Here I go!
I'm super strong!
I'll fight hard for you, Mon Frère!!
Uh, some of these lights are flashing…
You're the best, Mon Frère!
Go get 'em, Mon Frère!
