﻿﻿The Imperial Assault Troupe has arrived! 
Captain! There are more enemies coming in from our flank! We should divide our forces!! 
Roger! 
Roger! 
Come on! I'll take you all down!! 
Come and face me!! 
Raahhhh!! Come get some!! 
C'mon, let's have ourselves a party! 
I'm gonna beat you all! 
Whoever wants to die first, step forward! 
OK! Three of you follow me and we'll break through the front! The other three stay and guard our flank! 
Ogami! I'll go with you! 
Got it! You're with me, Sakura! 
Ogami… 
Thank you! I have nothing to fear if I'm by your side! 
Sakura… you stay here. 
… 
…understood. 
But… Ogami, please… please make it back to us! I'll be waiting for you! 
Rest assured, I won't get in the way. 
Alright, Ogami. This is it! Our final battle! Let's give them everything we've got. 
…oh, are you uncertain of my abilities? 
Understood. I'll stay here. It's up to you to defeat Tenkai, Ogami. 
Ensign… surely you wouldn't rob me of the starring role in this, our greatest performance? 
Of course not. 
Just as I suspected. This will be Sumire Kanzaki's most spectacular performance ever! 
I know you want to take the lead, but… I need you to stay here. 
…Understood. I'll wait here for the moment when I can sweep in and steal the show. 
Ensign. There's no time for you to think about this. 
If not me, who exactly were you planning to ask? 
Ensign… sure you don't mean that… 
…understood. I will remain here. 
Well, Chief, looks like it's the last battle. I'm pumped! 
Thanks, Kohran. I'll feel better having you fighting beside me. 
Hey, cut it out, Chief. You're making me blush here. 
…anyway, I'll make sure to live up to those expectations! 
Kohran, stay here and stop the enemy's movements from the back. This is something only you can do. 
… 
You got it, Chief. I'm better at takin' on groups anyway. You're right. 
I'll stay here and watch your back. Just leave it to me! 
What's with that look, Chief? 
I'd go even if you tried to stop me. I'm all fired up to whoop some butt!! 
…no need to think about it so hard, Chief. I'll stay here. 
Just leave the small fries to me, and you focus on taking down Tenkai! 
Sir, allow me to accompany you to the final battle. 
Alright, let's go, Maria. 
Of course! Everyone, I swear we'll make it back alive! 
… 
Maria, I need you to stay here. As my 2nd in command, I need you to lead the 2nd group. 
…understood. I will remain here. 
But sir… Please… please come back to us… 
As your 2nd in command I have a responsibility to see this final battle through with you. 
I know I'm overstepping my authority, sir, but please allow me to accompany you. 
…is it a difficult decision, sir? 
…I understand. I will remain here and guard your flank. 
Let's go, Mon Frère! 
Alright, let's do it, Iris! 
Yeah! If you're with me I won't be scared! Not one bit! 
… 
Iris, I need you to stay here. The fight ahead is too dangerous for you. Please leave it to me. 
Oh… OK. 
… 
I know you're worried about me… 
So I'll be good and wait here for you. But you have to win, Mon Frère! 
… 
Mon Frère… I'm going with you! 
I know I'm being selfish, but I want to help you! 
…I don't want to get in your way, so I'll stay here. 
But Mon Frère… you have to win! 
Boss! You've gotta take me with you for this one! 
Sounds good. It'll be nice having a one-woman-army by my side. 
Yeah, leave it to me, Boss! I've got your back! 
No, Kanna, stay here. We don't know what's going to try to flank us, but if you're here, you can stop whatever comes. 
I know you can hold the line here for us. I'm leaving it in your hands, Kanna. 
Got it. Watching everyone's backs is just as important as leading the charge. 
I'll keep them off your back, Boss. So you just focus on your fight! 
No time to decide, Boss. Listen, no matter what you say I'm coming with you. 
…I got it, Boss. No need to get all gloomy. 
I'll stay here and stop anything that tries to flank you. So you just focus on the battle in front of you! 
Alright!! You three I chose for the vanguard, fall in behind me! 
The rest of you, hold the enemy here! 
I think everyone will be fine without my protection. 
I will protect you, Sakura! 
I'll always be there to protect you, Sumire. 
Let me watch your back for you, Maria. 
I'll always be there for you, Iris. 
Don't worry, Kohran! I'll protect you! 
Kanna! I've got your back! 
Fight by my side. <br> You need to stay here. 
Of course. <br> Sumire, you need to stay here. 
I'll feel better with you. <br> I need to stop their advance. 
Alright, let's go, Maria. <br> I need you to stay here. 
OK, let's go, Iris! <br> I need you to stay here. 
Sounds good to me. Let's go! <br> I need you to stay here.
