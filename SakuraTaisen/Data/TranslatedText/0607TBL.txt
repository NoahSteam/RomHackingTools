It's a photo of Sakura. She's looking right at me. I wonder what she's thinking...
It's a photo of Sumire. This is a side of her you don't see too often.
It's a photo of Maria. ...She's lost in thought and looks kind of sad...
A photo of Kanna. Kanna's signature strength comes through clearly. 
A photo of Iris. She's surrounded by flowers and flashing a radiant smile.
A photo of Kohran. She's looking pretty in profile with her face dyed red by the evening sun.
A letter given to me by a patron. I was asked to give it to Sumire. I have a bad feeling about this...
Maria's pistol. This may help me escape from here...
A hair ornament. It's decorated with flowers and looks very elegant.
A pretty pendant. The delicate workmanship is gorgeous.
A hairpin for use in a traditional bun hairstyle. It would complement a formal outfit well.
This key will let me enter rooms I couldn't before.
I found this in a bedroom on the second floor. I can use it to access the back room.
A teacup Iris asked me to get for her. It has a very stylish design.
This is the matchbox Iris asked for. Its logo is quite colorful.
A knife Iris asked me to get for her. Just a normal utensil you'd use during a meal.
A prop sword and shield used onstage. They're well-made and look just like the real thing.
A prop crown used onstage. It's well-constructed and incredibly detailed.
A wig and costume used onstage. I wonder what kind of act could use a flashy outfit like this?
A photo of Sakura in her swimsuit. Wow, this is really something. I'm gonna treasure this.
A photo of Sumire in her stage costume. Her distinctive makeup really makes an impact.
It's a photo of Maria on stage in the military uniform from "For Love"... She's a beautiful woman disguised as a man. 
A photo of Kanna in her training gear. Catching her in a private moment like this feels surprisingly intimate.
A photo of Iris in her swimsuit. She's holding a rubber ring and looks ready to have some fun. How cute.
A photo of Kohran. I don't get to see her with her braids undone very often. It's a nice look.
A photo of Ayame in a traditional outfit. I hope she'll always be as happy and content as she is here.
Ayame's gun. Why...? Why did it have to turn out like this...?
Jean-Paul the teddy bear. Iris's best friend. She always carries him with her and takes good care of him.
Waaaaah!
.... Sakura!
Sakura! What is going on? Talk to me, Sakura!
Ugh... Aaaaaah!
Sakura!!
Commander! It's Sakura...
Sakura...

Yes...
Ah...
Sakura!
Sakura! What is wrong with you?
T-the thunder god...is going to take me away!
What?
Sakura, are you serious?
Give me a break. I wouldn't have taken you for a scaredy-cat.
Lieutenant Ogami, Lieutenant Ogami. This is General Yoneda. Please report to the command room immediately.
Lieutenant. The general wants to see you. We have to hurry to the command room.
Lieutenant. Please leave this to me.
If she's that scared of the God of Thunder... I wonder how she could ever ride a Kobu!
I'm afraid of the God of Thunder as well.
Sakura... She must have remembered something from her childhood days.
Is it...is it alright?
I'd like to speak with you alone...
I...I was a tomboy as a child...
I had a friend named Takeshi who I used to play and fight with...
One day, Grandma told me I couldn't play outside, but I invited Takeshi out anyway...
We were climbing trees. Then, suddenly...the sky turned pitch black...
Sakura, the Thunder God is angry! Hurry, we've gotta hide...
I'm fine! I'm not scared of some stupid Thunder God!
Takeshi! Takeshi! Takeshiii!
Takeshi was taken by the Thunder God.
All because I didn't listen to my grandma...
Untranslated
Ever since then...I've been scared of the Thunder God...scared that someday, I'll be taken away like Takeshi...
Silly, isn't it? Me, a pilot who rides the Koubu into battle, afraid of the Thunder God...
Kyaaaaah?!
Yes...T-the Thunder God is angry...

Well done, Satan! The last of the ley lines have finally given way!
The time has come! Let the heavens bellow! Let the earth cry out!
We shall make known the celebrated resurrection of our magnificent ruler!
Oh, I'm so embarrassed, I could die...I didn't want you to see me like that, Ogami...
Ogami...thank you so much.
Huh?! O-Ogami...
W-why?!
Heehee! Really now, Ogami...
B-but...
Ogami...
Are you sure you can do this?
Yeah!
Welcome to our shop. Good morning! What can I do for you?
Ah, Ogami, welcome! What can I do for you?
