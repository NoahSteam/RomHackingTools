﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿It's a photo of Sakura. She's looking right at me. I wonder what she's thinking…
It's a photo of Sumire. This is a side of her you don't see too often.
It's a photo of Maria. She's lost in thought and looks kind of sad…
A photo of Kanna. Her signature strength comes through clearly.
A photo of Iris. She's surrounded by flowers and flashing a radiant smile.
A photo of Kohran. She's looking pretty in profile with her face dyed red by the evening sun.
A letter given to me by a customer. I was asked to give it to Sumire. I have a bad feeling about this…
Maria's pistol. This may help me escape from here…
A hair ornament. It's decorated with flowers and looks very elegant.
A pretty pendant. The delicate workmanship is gorgeous.
A hairpin for use in a traditional bun hairstyle. It would complement a formal outfit well.
This key will let me enter rooms I couldn't before.
I found this in a bedroom on the second floor. I can use it to access the back room.
A set of cups Iris asked me to get for her. They have a very stylish design.
This is the matchbox Iris asked for. Its logo is quite colorful.
Some knives Iris asked me to get for her. Just a normal utensil you'd use during a meal.
A prop sword and shield used onstage. They're well-made and look just like the real thing.
A prop crown used onstage. It's well constructed and incredibly detailed.
A wig and costume used onstage. I wonder what kind of act could use a flashy outfit like this?
A photo of Sakura in her swimsuit. Wow, this is really something. I'm gonna treasure this.
A photo of Sumire in her stage costume. Her distinctive makeup really makes an impact.
It's a photo of Maria on stage in the military uniform from "For Love"… She's a beautiful woman disguised as a man.
A photo of Kanna in her training gear. Catching her in a private moment like this feels surprisingly intimate.
A photo of Iris in her swimsuit. She's holding a rubber ring and looks ready to have some fun. How cute.
A photo of Kohran. I don't get to see her with her braids undone very often. It's a nice look.
A photo of Ayame in a traditional outfit. I hope she'll always be as happy and content as she is here.
Ayame's gun. Why…? Why did it have to turn out like this…?
Jean-Paul the teddy bear. Iris's best friend. She always carries him with her and takes good care of him.
(…If you look closely, she's still wearing her stage hairdo.) 
(…She must have come here in a big hurry after the play ended.) 
(As always, that's some wild hair.) 
(It's Kanna's trademark headband. It always looks so good on her.) 
(I've heard that the store even sells "Kanna Headbands" for her kid fans.) 
(Wow… You don't usually see Kanna looking like this.) 
(I wonder what happened here…? Kanna's got a troubled look in her eyes.) 
(I wonder if she ran out of time… Her clothes are all over the place) 
(Why was Kanna in such a rush?) 
(Oho?! Maybe it's my imagination, but it seems like I can see more than usual…) 
(No! I can't believe I'm staring at Kanna's chest while she's upset… What am I doing?!) 
(O-Oh nooo! My eyes are drawn like a magnet to her breasts!) 
Boss… what exactly are you looking at?! 
Hey there! Just got done playing the star in my big performance! 
I suppose I should commend you for warming the audience up for me. 
What the hell! Are you still playing the evil hag off stage? Want me to beat you down in real life too? 
Excuse me? I only allowed you to defeat me on stage because the script demanded it! 
Huh, well that suits me just fine… Let's go! Ya evil hag!! 
With pleasure, you stupid ape! 
Oh! Nice! We're getting a special “Journey to the East” bonus chapter! 
(I guess everyone's all fired up now that the performance is over.) 
Um… Sakura? I was trying to say-… 
Oh, Kohran. About what we were talking about earlier… 
(Craaaaaap. She's completely ignoring me!) 
You did great out there, Sakura. 
You did good in reception too, Ogami. 
Uh, hey Sakura. About earlier… 
What do you want, Ogami? 
What's up you two? We've barely closed the curtains and you're already havin' a fight? 
Everyone's going to get together to talk about how this performance went. 
You all did great. I'm really looking forward to the next performance, considering how well this one went. 
Next will be our fall performance already. I can't believe how fast the year is going by… 
Sir… if you could, please keep what happened earlier confidential… 
Oh, hey Maria. Sorry about earlier. 
Oh, no… I should be the one to apologize. 
What's up, you two? Something happen? 
No, it was nothing… 
Well, I suppose we can let our hair down and relax for now, sir. 
Sumire and Kanna seem to have made amends after what happened at Fukagawa. 
Would you say this is all thanks to your leadership, sir? 
Respond humbly. <br> Show honest gratitude. <br> Joke as camouflage. 
I don't think so. I just did what came naturally. 
Heh… I'd say the ability to handle things like this naturally is a commendable quality. 
I don't think I could ever get those two to reconcile. 
Well, thanks. Do you… Do you think I've become a little more like a real captain? 
Come now, sir. You're already a great captain for the Flower Division. Have more confidence in yourself. 
Yep, you all should let me give you stage directions too… Ha. 
Heh… Yes, please. We'll be expecting your orders to guide us through the next performance, then. 
It takes a special kind of director to manage those two. 
Maria~… You talkin' about us behind our backs~? 
Could it be you're spreading rumors about us? 
Of course not. I was merely exchanging opinions on the performance with the captain, here. 
(Ha! If I'm a great director… Maria's a great actress.) 
… 
What's the matter, sir? You suddenly went quiet… 
…I was just thinking, it makes me glad to see everyone smiling again… that's all. 
It's the ordinary, peaceful days like these that can be the happiest for us… 
I, for one, am just glad to have the whole thing done with. 
I believe our autumn performance should be “Inferno of the Naga,” with song and dance by Sumire Kanzaki! 
I may've been evil in “Journey to the West,” but next time I'll be an alluring snake woman! Don't miss it, Kanna! 
S-Snake!? I-I'm out! No way am I gonna be in that play! 
Ohohoho! You are my preeeey! I won't let you escape. 
Why don't you play a spider? <br> You'd make a good snake. <br> I'd love to be prey myself… 
Then Kanna should be a spider woman. Spider Woman vs. Snake Woman; an epic rivalry for the ages. 
Hey, there's a plan! All right! I'm gonna wrap the snake woman up in my web! 
A-A spider woman!? Please don't give her any strange ideas, Ensign! 
Hey, that sounds great! Just leave it to me, I'll make you guys some awesome suits! 
You'd make a pretty good snake. I can just see it now, so sensual and tempting. 
Between the Demoness and this snake, I'd say you're world class at erotic roles, Sumire. 
…That praise doesn't please me in the slightest, Ensign… 
Hey, I'll be your prey anytime you want… 
Oh my, what a lovely thought. Once I have you in my coils, you won't escape, my cute little snack… 
Stooooop! You can't have Mon Frère! He's mine! 
Hmph, and here comes the little ragamuffin to spoil the wonderful adult mood… 
Don't worry about it… 
(Sumire as a snake, huh. I can just see her wrapping her body around her prey, letting her tongue play on her lips…) 
(And then she GULPS you down! Oh man… That's horrific, but I can't stop thinking about it!) 
Are you feeling unwell, Ensign? The color has gone from your face. 
N-No! I'm good! Hahaha! 
Looks like this'll be my happiest birthday yet! 
My birthday's coming up on September 7th, Boss! 
Oh, really!? 
Well it's a little early, but happy birthday. 
Thanks… Hehe, this is actually the first time anyone will be around to celebrate my birthday with me. 
Hey, take a guess, Boss. How old do you think I'll be turning? 
18? <br> 20? <br> 22? 
…18? 
18! Hahaha! No way! Was that supposed to be a compliment? 
Oh, no, I really thought… 
Well you'll be surprised to hear I'm turning 20, then. Yep, 20. Next year will be my Coming of Age Ceremony. 
Oh, really? Sorry, I had no idea. 
Hey, no need to apologize. No way I'd get upset over someone thinking I look younger! 
Well, Kanna, in your case I would describe you as childish, rather than youthful. 
Hey I'm fine with that… Nothing wrong with being a kid at heart. 
It's gonna be weird to have everyone suddenly treating me like an adult just because I turn 20… 
And I don't want to forget what it's like to be a kid; honest, straightforward… 
20? 
Oh! Right on the money, Boss. So you knew? 
Well, yes, of course… 
That's our captain for you. You've got all our stats memorized. 
I mean, don't take that the wrong way. I think that's great! 
Look at this girl, getting all worked up over a birthday at her age… How childish. 
22? 
Huh? Seriously? Do I look that old to you? 
Well, no, I mean… 
Come on, Boss. That's a little rude. I'm still only 19. 
Get it together. You should at least know the ages of the members in your command! 
…
Hey why'd you go all quiet… 
Oh, it's just that I thought it would be rude to try and guess a lady's age. 
…“Lady?” Are we still talking about me? 
Ahahaha! Nice one, Boss! 
Was it really that funny? 
…No, well, I mean… nobody's ever called me a lady before. I mean it's not bad at all. 
I'm just not used to paying attention to that kind of thing, so it feels a little weird. Just treat me normally.
All right. I'll remember that. 
Hey there, you ready to party! Let's raise the roof! Party! 
Oh… Chief… Hey, listen, sorry about earlier… 
I'm fine, but how are you, Kohran? That must have been a shock. 
…Yeah, it was. I was so close I could taste it… 
Aww… If only I hadn't mixed up that wiring… Gosh darnit. 
Maaaan… 
What's the matter, Kohran? You're looking down… 
Oh, Chief… Sorry. You're right, I should be partying with everyone else… 
But I accidentally busted this great new robot I'd been building for a whole month. 
I mean, it was my own fault, but I was just so close to finishing it… I just feel bad for the poor little guy… 
Sorry, shouldn't have said it. <br> Let's see a smile! 
Sorry, I shouldn't have brought it up. 
Hey, nothing for you to be apologizing for, Chief. 
Everything breaks eventually. “Dust to dust” and all that. Just gotta pick up the pieces and start again! 
Sorry for getting you worried, Chief… but thanks, you helped me get back on my feet. 
Let's see a smile, Kohran! It's sad you lost your robot, but… 
Everyone makes mistakes. What's important is dusting yourself off and trying again. 
You got that right. No sense wasting time moping around when I could be inventing more new stuff! 
Thanks, Chief! You helped kick my gears back into drive! 
… 
Oh, sorry. I didn't mean to drag you down, pushing my problems onto you… 
But it felt good just to get it off my chest. 
Kohran… I'm really sorry about earlier… 
…My invention… My cute little Party Boy is dead… 
…All because a certain party pooper messed up! 
I'm really, really sorry! <br> I'll buy you something nice? 
I'm really, really sorry! 
Ha, hahaha… I'm just kidding! I'm not mad at all, really. 
That whole thing happened cuz' I got my wires crossed. It wasn't anything you did, Chief. 
Besides, I've still got my Plan B… 
Plan B? 
Oh you'll see… just you wait. 
Listen, I'll buy you something nice! Anything you want! Just say you forgive me. 
Wellllll now. Anything I want, hm?… That DOES sound nice. 
Heyyyyy, everybody! Chief's saying he'll get us anything we want! 
Oh wow! Then I want ice cream! A whole bunch! 
I've always wanted to try the blowfish dish served at my favorite restaurant. 
Hey I'm fine with anything as long as it's all I can eat! 
Whaaa!? Hey, wait just a second! 
Looks like everyone's got their orders in. Good luck with that, Chief. 
Oh man… 
… 
Aw, don't look so downhearted, Chief. I'm just joking! Don't worry about it. 
Kohran, I'm really sorry. 
Hey I'm already over it. If that one's busted I just gotta make a new one. 
It's not inventing unless stuff explodes! Oh, and I've got a patent on that, so don't go using it. 
Anyway there's a party going on and we should be partying! 
Go away… Mon Perv! 
(Looks like she hasn't forgiven me for seeing her in the shower room…) 
I can't wait to be a lead in my own play. 
Good work today, Mon Frère. 
Thanks, Iris. Today we had a full house, so it was pretty rough. 
Hey, can I collect tickets with you some time? I want to see what it's like. 
Be my partner for a day. <br> That's my job! <br> …It's no walk in the park. 
Sure, you can be my partner for a day. 
Really? All right! It's a promise, Mon Frère! 
But won't they need you up on stage while I'm working? 
That's OK. I can teleport! 
Hey now, don't go doing that while you're on stage please… 
OK! Don't forget, Mon Frère! You promised! 
Heck no. That's my job! 
Awww! You're no fun!! 
Whoa! Are you finally taking this ticket punching thing seriously, Chief? 
After all that complaining, it seems these are your true colors? 
Oh, no… I just… kinda got caught up in the moment… 
Hey, nothing to be ashamed of Boss! You gotta take pride in your job, no matter what it is. 
You go and punch those tickets, Chief. We're counting on you! 
Hey cut it out, you guys… 
…It's no walk in the park, Iris… 
…? What's the matter, Mon Frère? 
The days of a ticket puncher are rough. Day in, day out. Through wind, rain and storms… 
I punch tickets… and I keep punching! Punch! Punch! All day long! 
And if the numbers don't match up, if I missed even a single ticket… the office calls for my head on a platter. 
Mon Frère you're scaring me… 
Not good! The light's gone out in Chief’s eyes! 
It seems things have been more difficult for you than I would have imagined, Ensign. 
Oh come on, it's not that bad. Suck it up, Boss! 
…Anyway, ticket clipping isn't something you want to do for fun. 
OK, Mon Frère… Please stop… 
… 
Hey Chief, how come you went all quiet? 
Did I say something weird? 
Hey, being a ticket puncher is nothing to be ashamed of, Boss. 
Kanna is right. If you apply yourself and do your best at clipping tickets, eventually you'll work your way up… 
Work his way up to what? 
…I’m not sure. I'm afraid it's not a position with much upward mobility. 
Haha! Then Mon Frère's gonna be a ticket puncher forever! 
… 
Uh-oh… I think we crushed his spirit. 
Excuse me, Ensign? Are you planning to leave me here by myself? 
Sir… where are you heading off to? 
C'mon Boss, don't go running off now. 
Where ya going, Mon Frère? 
Hey, Chief, where ya going? 
All right. The performance is over, so now it's time to set up for the party! 
…The party? 
Yeah, we’re throwing a party to celebrate the end of the performance. You're planning to come too, right? 
The more the merrier. 
It will be splendid! Everyone drinking and singing together until sunrise! 
Sounds fun, I'm in. <br> Hey, no alcohol. <br> Let's get drunk and sing! 
…Got it. Sounds fun, count me in. 
That's our Chief! I knew you wouldn't let us down! 
Hmm. Well you seem to be in good spirits, Ogami. 
That sounds great! Let's order a feast! 
Great! I'm staying up a~ll night tonight! 
Let's do this! We'll eat our fills… 
And drink our fills as well. 
Hey! There will be no alcohol served. Don't forget you're all still minors! 
…Though, setting the alcohol aside, it is nice letting our hair down now and then. 
All right! Looks like we're all on board, so let's start getting ready! 
Hey, no alcohol. 
Excuse me!? A party with no alcohol is like a cherry blossom viewing without the cherry blossoms! 
Yeah, she's right! Don't go raining on our parade. 
I'm fine with juice! I don't even want any alcohol. 
Hehe… Come to think of it, didn't you get drunk on amazake when we saw the cherry blossoms, Sumire? 
Hmph… Ridiculous. A lady such as myself would never get drunk off a sake as light as amazake! 
Anyway, there will be no alcohol served. Don't forget you're all still minors! 
…Though, setting the alcohol aside, it is nice letting our hair down now and then. 
All right! Looks like we're all on board, so let's start getting ready! 
All right! Let's get drunk and sing! 
That's our Ensign! Everyone needs some partying in their life! 
You got that right! Let's party till the sun comes up! Time to bust out that aged sake we've been saving! 
Hey! There will be no alcohol served. Don't forget you're all still minors! 
Have you lost your mind, sir? You should be stopping them, not encouraging them! 
…Sorry. 
…Though, setting the alcohol aside, it is nice letting our hair down now and then. 
I will authorize this party. 
All right! Looks like we're all on board, so let's start getting ready! 
… 
What's up, Boss? You went all quiet… 
Oh, I was just wondering. Is it really all right for me to come? It's not like I was part of the performance. 
Oh come on! You don't need to worry about that, Ogami! 
Don't be so stand-offish, Chief! You're a fine member of the theater! 
…The member that clips people's tickets. 
We all need to relax, every once in a while, sir. 
But everyone is still underage, so no alcohol. I'm especially looking at you, Sumire. 
What? But what's the point of a party with no alcohol? 
Hey, I'm fine as long as I can eat my fill of tasty food. You gotta come party with us, Boss. 
Thanks. OK, I'll be happy to join you all! 
All right! Looks like we're all on board, so let's start getting ready!
