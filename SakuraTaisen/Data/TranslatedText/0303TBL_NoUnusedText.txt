I wonder… just what did Setsuna mean… 
All those things he said about Maria… what was he getting at? 
Boss…! Boss, open up! It's an emergency! 
Kanna, what's wrong? 
Boss! Maria… Maria just ran off in her Koubu! 
What!? Are you sure, Kanna!? 
Don't tell me… is she going to fight Setsuna alone…? 
Boss, we can talk later. We need to get to the command room! 
Right! 
… looks like everyone but Sakura is here. 
What happened with Maria? 
… Kohran tried to stop her but… she didn't make it in time. 
I was running some maintenance on the Koubu when Maria showed up. 
I called out to her but she just hopped in her Koubu and took off. Didn't even give me a single glance. 
(… I knew it. She's going to fight Setsuna alone…) 
Ogami… do you know what's going on? 
Yeah… Setsuna from the Hive of Darkness called Maria 'kazuar', and I think it riled her up… 
Ah…! 
Hey… what's 'kazuar' mean? 
I suppose this is something you should all hear… 
… this is from back when Maria lived in Russia… 
There was a storm of revolution, as the people rose up against the tyranny of the totalitarian royalty… 
Among the fighters at the heart of that revolution was a lone girl… 
Her codename was 'kazuar', meaning 'cassowary'. That girl was Maria. 
In Japan we call cassowary 'the fire-eating bird'. 
Maria earned that nickname for her fighting style, running like a black flame through the battlefield. 
Her commander at that time… well, he was like a brother to her… 
But… he lost his life fighting in a certain battle. The support from his group came to late. 
Maria was afraid of all the gunfire. She hesitated, and her supporting fire came too late… it still haunts her. 
Ever since that day… she's always regretted her fatal mistake on the battlefield. 
I think she's especially conscious of you, Ogami. It seems to me she sees her old self in you… 
So that's why she's always particularly strict with him… she's trying to prevent another tragedy. 
S, Sakura!? You should be in bed! 
I heard the alarm. Don't forget I'm a member of the Flower Division too! I can't just stay in bed for this!! 
Sakura… 
But… still, for her to run off to fight alone… 
I think… she probably didn't want us to know. 
She's always been like that. 
She never wants anyone else to know about the tragedies in her past. 
I think, especially… she didn't want you to know, boss… 
… 
I had no idea Maria was carrying that kind of baggage… 
Can't believe she even kept it from me, after all we've been through together! She's just trying to play the martyr! 
I'm… not too fond of sticking my nose in other people's business, but… 
Now that I know what she's feeling, I can't leave her alone! 
Uncle Ichi, take care of Maria, okay? 
Let's go, Ogami! 
Right!! Imperial Assault Troupe, move out!
