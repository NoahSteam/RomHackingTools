A photo of Sakura. She's staring straight at me. I wonder what she's thinking...
A photo of Sumire. I didn't know she had this side to her, she doesn't show it much.
A photo of Maria... She's so lost in thought. She looks sad somehow...
A photo of Kanna. She looks strong and reliable. I can't wait to meet her.
A photo of Iris. She's surrounded by flowers and flashing a radiant smile.
A photo of Kohran. She's looking pretty in profile with her face dyed red by the evening sun.
A letter given to me by a customer. I was asked to give it to Sumire. I have a bad feeling about this...
Maria's pistol. This may help me escape from here...
A hair ornament. It's decorated with flowers and looks very elegant.
A pretty pendant. The delicate workmanship is gorgeous.
A hairpin for use in a traditional bun hairstyle. It would complement a formal outfit well.
This key will allow me to enter rooms I couldn't get into before.
I found this in a bedroom on the second floor. Now I can get into the room at the back.
A teacup Iris asked me to get for her. It has a very stylish design.
A matchbox Iris asked me to get for her. The brand logo is very colorful.
A knife Iris asked me to get for her. Just a normal utensil you'd use during a meal.
A prop sword and shield used onstage. They're well made and look just like the real thing.
A prop crown used onstage. It's well constructed and incredibly detailed.
A wig and costume used onstage. I wonder what kind of act could use a flashy outfit like this?
A photo of Sakura in her swimsuit. Wow, this is really something. I'm gonna treasure this.
A photo of Sumire in her stage costume. Her distinctive makeup really makes an impact.
It's a photo of Maria on stage in the military uniform from "For Love"... She's a beautiful woman disguised as a man.
A photo of Kanna in her training gear. Catching her in a private moment like this feels surprisingly intimate.
A photo of Iris in her swimsuit. She's holding a rubber ring and looks ready to have some fun. How cute.
A photo of Kohran. I don't get to see her with her braids undone very often. It's a nice look.
A photo of Ayame in a traditional outfit. I hope she'll always be as happy and content as she is here.
Ayame's gun. Why...? Why did it have to turn out like this...?
Jean-Paul the teddy bear. Iris's best friend. She always carries him with her and takes good care of him.
Wha...?
Wh-What?! D-Deputy commander?!
Th-The pleasure is all mine!
Y-Yes ma'am. Everyone! Let's do our best!
Come forth, Four Lords of Death...!
We are gathered here before you...
How may we be of service?
What was the meaning of that debacle, you imbeciles?!
Well, a mysterious group called the Imperial Combat Revue thwarted our plans...
I do not want excuses!
Our apologies, Master Tenkai...
The fact is they are quite skilled...
Silence, Satan! We are supposed to be invincible!
I've devised a way to destroy the barrier around Teito! ...A spell called the "Six Fallen Stars."
Complete this spell and destroy all of Teito! Your first target shall be Shiba Park!
Ha~!
Wait! This time I shall come along. I'm sure you would like to watch me fight.
Don't you agree, Satan?
Of course...
Hmph! Your days are numbered, you old fool...
Eeeeeek!!
Cough, cough...Um...This is the Imperial Theater, right?
Cough...Awww...My steambike is totaled...
The name's Kohran Li. Starting today, I've transferred from the Imperial Assault Hanayashiki Branch to Ginza Headquarters.
Yoneda! Yoneda, where are you?!
No sweat! I'll go by myself!
Augh! My face is up here, yanno!
The steam bike I invented boasts 4 cylinders and 5 valves! It runs at 100 horsepower and 200 km per hour!
Does that sound like a mess to you?! You better watch yourself, buddy...
Or I'm gonna knock your block off!
As long as you get it, we're cool! I'm Kohran Li, scientific genius.
I'll be living here from now on. Nice to meetcha!
Anyways, who are you?
Ho, I guess that makes you my boss...
I humbly introduce myself as Kohran Li, just transferred from the Hanayashiki Branch to Ginza Headquarters!
Please direct me to Lieutenant General Yoneda, sir!
Much obliged, Ensign Ogami...
No sweat! I'll find him myself!
Are you a Koubu pilot, too?
They're complex machines, and typically only girls have the spiritual energy to pilot them.
It's rare to see a guy pilot one. You must be a real hot shot!
By the way, the Hive of Darkness is made up of remnants of the Tokugawa regime who wanna overthrow the government.
We've got to stop them.
Come in!
Welcome to our shop. Good morning! What can I do for you?
How do you do? I'm Tsubaki Takamura. It's a pleasure to meet you, Ogami!
Ah, Ogami, welcome! What can I do for you?
I hope I was able to be of service. Thank you very much for coming by!
Andre, my love! Please...run away with me.
Were I to abandon my duty and men to run away with you... I would be a different man.
Would you still love me then?
Oh, Andre!
Grrrr! Arrrrgh!
Hello there. You're Ogami, right? I'm Yuri Sakakibara!
I do the theater's office work. I'm looking forward to working with you!
Oh my, did you come by to see me? Hee hee, only teasing you!
Do you need me for anything?
I hope I was able to be of service.
It's nice to meet you, Ogami. I'm Kasumi Fujii.
I'm the theater's office work manager.
Do you need something?
Good work today.
Look, it's still swollen. Let me give it a lick for you one more time.
No need to be embarrassed!
How is it...?
Doing your best is all well and good but take it easy OK...?
Wow, looks like you were having heaps of fun, huh?
Lucky you, she almost looked like your girlfriend.
Is that so... Well then...
Hey now... Are you OK?
Ok you say... But you're bleeding aren't you? Let me take a look.
She's so... pretty. That girl... I wonder who she is. ...*sigh*.
Ogling and fawning over girls is really disrespectful you know...
Hey, that's so rude! Since when did I act like your wife!?
You're the worst!

Thank you for your hard work.
This is the Deputy Commander of the Imperial Combat Revue, and chief of the Hanayashiki Branch.
I'm Ayame Fujieda. I'm pleased to meet you, Ogami.
A captain must be able to make judgments in an instant. I have high hopes for you. Good luck.
Ahhh...
Cursed Imperial Assault Force! Defiant to the last I see!
In that case, I, Tenkai, shall show you the meaning of true terror!!
Lords of Death!!
Annihilate Teito!! Destroy... the Imperial Assault Force!!
Destroy! Destroy! Destroy!
How is it...?
Doing your best is all well and good but take it easy OK...?
No worries! I always carry a repair kit with me just in case!
I'll have it fixed in a jiffy!
By the way, Ensign. You went up against the Hive of Darkness, right?
How'd it feel?
Heh! You've got guts! I like that.
Don't get too cocky, though. We don't know what'll happen next.
Really? I appreciate your honesty, Ensign. Most people couldn't admit that.
And now that I'm here, you've got nothing to worry about! I'll protect you!
Er, you don't have to talk about it if you don't want to.
After all, everybody's gone through stuff they'd rather forget!
Say no more, say no more.
Just give it all you've got next time, Ensign!
I-is that my photo?! Gee, how embarrassing!
Um, Ensign? I want to go to the Manager's Office...
I'll be on this stage very soon...
Are you sure about this, Ensign?
A captain must be able to make judgments in an instant. I have high hopes for you. Do your best Ogami.
Do your best, Ogami.
Eyaaaah!!
S-Sir!!
Welcome to our shop. Good morning! What can I do for you?
Ah, Ogami, welcome! What can I do for you?
