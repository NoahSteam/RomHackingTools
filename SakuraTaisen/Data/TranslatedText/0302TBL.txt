It's a photo of Sakura. She's looking right at me. I wonder what she's thinking...
It's a photo of Sumire. This is a side of her you don't see too often.
It's a photo of Maria. ...She's lost in thought and looks kind of sad...

A photo of Kohran. She's looking pretty in profile, her face dyed red by the evening sun.
A letter given to me by a customer. I was asked to give it to Sumire. I have a bad feeling about this...
Maria's pistol. This may help me escape from here...
A hair ornament. It's decorated with flowers and looks very elegant.
A pretty pendant. The delicate workmanship is gorgeous.
A hairpin for use in a traditional bun hairstyle. It would compliment a formal outfit well.
This key will allow me to enter rooms I couldn't get into before.
I found this in a bedroom on the second floor. I can use it to access the back room.

This is the matchbox Iris asked for. Its logo is quite colorful.
A matchbox Iris asked me to get for her. The brand logo is very colorful.
A knife Iris asked me to get for her. Just a normal utensil you'd use during a meal.
A prop sword and shield used onstage. They're well made and look just like the real thing.
A wig and costume used onstage. I wonder what kind of act could use a flashy outfit like this?
A photo of Sakura in her swimsuit. Wow, this is really something. I'm gonna treasure this.
A photo of Sumire in her stage costume. Her distinctive makeup really makes an impact.
It's a photo of Maria on stage in the military uniform from "For Love"... She's a beautiful woman disguised as a man.

A photo of Kohran. I don't get to see her with her braids undone very often. It's a nice look.
A photo of Ayame in a traditional outfit. I hope she'll always be as happy and content as she is here.
Ayame's gun. Why...? Why did it have to turn out like this...?
Ayame's gun. Why...? Why did it have to turn out like this...?
I heard the noise. Didn't think you were trying to kill yourselves though!
Huh?
Huh? Who're you?
Kanna! Did ya bring me anything?
Sorry Iris, all my luggage got washed away!
Oh, Kanna! So all this time you've been fine?
Well, the boat from Okinawa sunk. I ended up swimming back.
As indomitable as ever, I see.
Looks like we've got one... two... three newbies!
So who's this guy making all the fuss? ... Mind telling me your name?
Whoa, you're the ensign?! You sure have got the look for it! Man, I like you!!
Kanna, these are our new recruits Sakura and Kohran.
Yo!
Sakura Shinguji. Pleased to meet you!
And I'm Kohran Li! Hey, if you don't mind me saying... you're a pretty handsome guy.
Hehe... well, thanks for that but I'm actually a girl. But no hard feelings, yeah?
Kanna Kirishima... She's the successor to the Ryukyu Karate Kirishima Style. Now that she's here, the whole Flower Division is assembled!
Yo, chief! It's been a while!
We're glad to have you back, Kanna!

The commander's life can be lost during just one moment of bad judgement! Do you understand?!
Untranslated
Sir! You are a failure as a commander!
So you've come around?
Heheheh...
Heheheh, you have fallen into our clutches at last, Ichiro Ogami. With this, the Revue's end is at hand.
Heheh, well then, Ogami. Let me introduce you to my brilliant assistant.
Heya, Ogami! Man, you sure look a mess.
Heheheh... How does it feel, Ogami? Knowing you'll be remodeled by your former subordinate?
By our hand, you will be reconstructed as the Hive of Darkness's newest minion!
Now, Kohran! Pour every ounce of your skill into the creation of our new comrade: the New Ichiro Ogami!
Right-o, leave it to me!
You called for me, Commander?
It sounds like you chewed out that idiot Ogami. I heard what happened.
Sakura's injuries are clearly due to the Ensign's flawed judgement.
If he is incorrect in his orders on the battlefield, it won't make a difference how many troops we have!
The troops, your... comrades.
Maria... are you still thinking about what happened back then...?
Ensign Ogami? Enter!
Maria Tachibana! Member of the Imperial Combat Revue, soldier of the Russian Revolution...
Or perhaps, I should call you "Cassowary"?!
The Hive of Darkness has seen through to your true identity!
Your position as a soldier of the Capital who defends justice is but a mere facade... when in truth, you are a stone-hearted savage!
Tch...!
If you don't wish your past exposed for all your comrades to see, you will show yourself before us immediately!
Kuku... hahahahaha!
Kukuku... so you came, Ogami... you're quite courageous!
Sir!
The situation is as you can see...
Sir, why did you come!?
It's a trap!! Run!
Don't throw everything away... I'm not worth it...
Oh spare me the melodrama! You can continue your whining in Hell!!
On your feet, Ogami!! Can't have you dying so easily. Where's the fun in that...?
Sir!
Fu, hahaha...! What's the matter? I expected more from the leader of the Imperial Revue!
Now then, time to finish this!
Siiiiir!
W, what's this!?
Stop right there!
Everyone!?
H, how did you find this place...!?
Times like this are exactly why we stick a tracker on the collar of everyone in the Revue!
Curses!! No matter, I have no problem finishing the lot of you!
Lookit this punk, trying to act all tough. Now then...
Time for you to pay the tab for hurting Maria!
Commander! Leave this to us!
Looks like Maria's Koubu is is still okay. Hurry up and get in there, you two!
Hurry!!
Everyone... this is foolish!
But... thanks!
I didn't think you'd come for me... thank you, sir!
Forgive me. Recently, I've been...
That's... my locket...
You didn't... open it did you?
I see... Thank you, sir.
Hmph... what's going on here!? Care to explain this romantic atmosphere!?
Untranslated
Well... you seem to have a case of wandering eyes, Ogami...
Save your excuses.
Ensign Ogami! You are a man fit to lead the Assault Force Flower Division!
Let's do this, everyone!!
Yeah!!
Hey I'm the one asking, here.
Eh, no worries... I'm Kanna Kirishima. Who're you?
Kanna, this is Ensign Ichiro Ogami. He's the current leader of the Flower Division.
What? Hey, Maria, when did we get a new leader?
A lot of things happened while you were gone. Let's just leave it at that.
Oh boy, this is great! I've been dying to take a shot at modifying a human body!
No worries! All of my experiments on animals so far have been successful!
Alrighty. This won't hurt a bit, so you just quit that wriggling and leave everything to me!
Hey, he's MY boyfriend!
Wow~! You've got some real skills, Ogami.
Ogami...
Commander...
Untranslated
If the Ensign hadn't hesitated to give the order to attack that time, this wouldn't have happened!
Yaaah!
Welcome to our shop. Good morning! What can I do for you?
Ah, Ogami, welcome! What can I do for you?
