It's a photo of Sakura. She's looking right at me. I wonder what she's thinking...
It's a photo of Sumire. This is a side of her you don't see too often.
It's a photo of Maria. ...She's lost in thought and looks kind of sad...
It's a photo of Kanna. She's looking strong and sturdy. I hope I get to meet her soon.
It's a photo of Iris. Surrounded by flowers, she looks like a cute little flower herself.
It's a photo of Kohran. Chinese clothes look good on her. I wonder what kind of girl she is.
It's the letter the guest left with me. I was told to give it to Sumire, but...Hmmm.
It's Maria's gun. ...Is there a way to use this to escape?
It's a hair ornament. It's shaped like a flower and really cute.
It's a pretty brooch. The fine craftsmanship is gorgeous.
It's a hairpin. This would look best with Japanese clothes and a married woman's hairstyle. 
It's Iris's dear friend, Jean-Paul the teddy bear. She loves this stuffed animal.
With this key, I should be able to get into rooms I couldn't enter before.
I found this in the second-floor bedroom. With it, I should be able to get into the inner rooms.
This is the cup Iris asked me to bring. It's a little bit fancy.
This is the matchbox Iris asked me to bring. As matchboxes go, the cover is pretty colorful.
This is the knife Iris asked me to bring. It's a perfectly normal table knife. 
This fake sword and shield were used in plays. The props have been made with care down to the last detail. 
This fake crown was used in plays. The intricate details have been rendered with great skill.
This wig is used on stage. What kind of play would have such a flashy costume?
Is that Sakura in a swimsuit? What a photo...I'll never let anyone else have this.
It's Sumire in her stage costume. Her powerful makeup is really impressive.
It's Maria on stage. Is that the military uniform from "For Love"...? She looks great in men's clothes.
It's rare to see one of her training. This photo has a kind of private feel to it.
Iris in a swimsuit? It's so cute that she has a pool tube.
A photo of Kohran. I don't get to see her with her braids undone very often. It's a nice look.
A photo of Ayame in a traditional outfit. I hope she'll always be as happy and content as she is here.
Ayame's gun. Why...? Why did it have to turn out like this...?
Nothing I can do here. I'd better check somewhere else...
There's no one here. I'd better check somewhere else...
I'd better check somewhere else...
I'm not making any progress here. Maybe I should go to the manager's office and talk to Lt Gen Yoneda.
But...the more I wander around this place, the more it seems like a normal theater...
...So, a flower-viewing party in Ueno Park after battle? The cherry blossoms at night aren't too shabby.
...But, sir, why do you keep everything about the Hive of Darkness top secret?
I see. So that's what makes it a secret squadron.
No problem. Thank you too, Sakura.
I said, let me handle it!
G-got it.
Hahaha, thanks.
(How can you get drunk on amazake?)
Eee?!
...Um...Are you Ensign Ichiro Ogami?
I'm Sakura Shinguji.
Lieutenant General Yoneda has tasked me with being your escort.
Yes, ma'am!
Imperial Combat Revue, Flower Division, Sakura Shinguji.

...Now, shall we proceed to the Imperial Theater?
Not exactly. The Imperial Theater contains the headquarters of the Imperial Assault Force.

Shall we proceed to the Imperial Theater?
About me...?
Untranslated
I'm still just a burden to everyone at the theater.
But I'm ready to put my life on the line to protect this city.
Making the 'Koubu' work is a tough job.  But as fellow rookies, let's do our best together.
Come on, let's go! Lieutenant General Yoneda is waiting!
This is your first time here, isn't it? Let's enter through the front lobby.
Untranslated
Untranslated
Oooh! Sakura, is this your boyfriend?
Iris! You shouldn't tease grown-ups like that.
This is Ensign Ichiro Ogami. He's just transferred to the Imperial Assault Force.
I'm Iris. I'm in the Imperial Assault Force too, in the Flower Division.
And this bear here is Jean Paul. He's my very best friend, so you better be nice to him.

What's wrong?
This man has spiritual energy too……  He'll be fighting in a 'Koubu,' won't he.

I…… don't like it when people fight……

Ah! You over there!
Who else? Wipe that foolish look off your face and come here! 
I seem to have dropped my fork. I don't supposed you could pick it up and fetch me a new one?
Well then, do you expect me to pick it up myself?
I'll have you know I'm the sole heir to Kanzaki Industry and the leading star of this theater! And furthermore...
…the top lady of Japanese high society, I, Sumire Kanzaki, should pick up a fork dropped on the floor!?
How very dare you! You're fired! You'll be sent packing as soon as I've reported you to the director!
Ah…… <br> My, oh, no…… <br> Hahaha……
No wonder you made such a strange waiter...So terribly sorry.

My thanks. By the way, I happen to be Sumire Kanzaki, the top star of this theater.
Although somehow or other, Maria ended up as the leader of our opera troupe. What do you think of that?
Honestly, that old fart Yoneda has no eye for talent!
Oh my, what shall I do!  How rude of me.  Hahaha……
Let's just keep what I said just now a secret from Mr. Yoneda!  Is that clear?  (Mwa!)

And who might you be?
Are you Ensign Ogami, the new transfer to the Imperial Assault Force?
Greetings. I am Maria Tachibana.
Is there...something stuck to my face?
Lieutenant General Yoneda is in the director's office. I have training now, so I'll be on my way...
I leave you with a bit of advice. Do not stare when you're talking to a woman! Now, if you'll excuse me!
Yesh, come on in.
Ah, I've heard about you from Count Hanakoji. Now, let'sh drop the formalities.
Thish here is the Imperial Theater. No need for all that military talk.

Welcome to our shop. Good morning! What can I do for you?
Untranslated
Ah, Ogami, welcome! What can I do for you?
I hope I was able to be of service. Thank you very much for coming by!
Uwah!
Ah, hello?...Yes yes, hello.
Yes, he's here...just a little while ago. Well, I'm going to wait a bit longer, see how things shake out...
But you know, Hanakoji...the matter of this secret corps is a tough pill to swallow.
We drive these girls onto the battlefield, while all we can do is sit back and watch. As an Imperial soldier, well...it's humiliating.
And yet, right now they are the only ones who can operate the Koubu.
That's why I'm making it a point to protect these girls, while giving them as much freedom as possible.
If only we could make use of that young one...
Oho, looks as though he's come by to complain. Well, goodbye for now...
Ah, good morning. You're Ogami, right? I'm Yuri Sakakibara!
I do the theater's office work. I'm looking forward to working with you!
Oh my, did you come by to see me? Hee hee, only teasing you!
Do you need me for anything?
I hope I was able to be of service.
It's nice to meet you, Ogami. I'm Kasumi Fujii.
I'm the theater's office work manager.
Do you need something?
Good work today.

Oh, come now, Ogami. What do you think would happen if we didn't? Riots, that's what...
We'd be playing right into their hands. No matter what, we must fight them in absolute secrecy!
Thank you so much for today.
It's a good thing you were here, Ogami.
Heeey, why sho sherioush? Lighten up, willya?
Oh my...up closhe, you sure are handshome! Hic! You're my type, y'knooow?
The battle against these enemies has just begun, so don't get too carried away...

Are you the person who just arrive today? Nice to meet you! I'm glad we'll be working together.

Come again!
Ohh goshhh, I was only joking!
Hee hee. Thanks, Ogami.
Oh, okay then. I got it!
Hee hee. You're a hoot, Ogami!
Seriously, don't give it another thought.
It's fine, Ogami. Don't worry yourself over it.
Nice to meet you. You're Ogami, right? I'm Kasumi Fujii, the theater's office manager.
I'm sorry to impose, but would you mind coming with me to the secretary's office to fill out some new-hire forms?
I'm afraid it's regulation, but it shouldn't take too long. I hope you understand.
Um...did you hear me, Ogami?
Then I'll guide you there. This way, please.
If you wouldn't mind, please fill out these forms for me.
Yes, that's fine. Thanks very much.
