It's a photo of Sakura. She's looking right at me. I wonder what she's thinking...
It's a photo of Sumire. This is a side of her you don't see too often.
It's a photo of Maria. ...She's lost in thought and looks kind of sad...
A photo of Kanna. Kanna's signature strength comes through clearly. 
A photo of Iris. She's surrounded by flowers and flashing a radiant smile.
A photo of Kohran. She's looking pretty in profile with her face dyed red by the evening sun.
A letter given to me by a customer. I was asked to give it to Sumire. I have a bad feeling about this...
Maria's pistol. This may help me escape from here...
A hair ornament. It's decorated with flowers and looks very elegant.
A pretty pendant. The delicate workmanship is gorgeous.
A hairpin for use in a traditional bun hairstyle. It would complement a formal outfit well.
Jean-Paul the teddy bear. Iris's best friend. She always carries him with her and takes good care of him.
This key will let me enter rooms I couldn't before.
I found this in a bedroom on the second floor. I can use it to access the back room.
A teacup Iris asked me to get for her. It has a very stylish design.
This is the matchbox Iris asked for. Its logo is quite colorful.
A knife Iris asked me to get for her. Just a normal utensil you'd use during a meal.
A prop sword and shield used onstage. They're well made and look just like the real thing.
A prop crown used onstage. It's well-constructed and incredibly detailed.
A wig and costume used onstage. I wonder what kind of act could use a flashy outfit like this?
A photo of Sakura in her swimsuit. Wow, this is really something. I'm gonna treasure this.
A photo of Sumire in her stage costume. Her distinctive makeup really makes an impact.
It's a photo of Maria on stage in the military uniform from "For Love"... She's a beautiful woman disguised as a man. 
A photo of Kanna in her training gear. Catching her in a private moment like this feels surprisingly intimate.
A photo of Iris in her swimsuit. She's holding a rubber ring and looks ready to have some fun. How cute.
A photo of Kohran. I don't get to see her with her braids undone very often. It's a nice look.
A photo of Ayame in a traditional outfit. I hope she'll always be as happy and content as she is here.
Ayame's gun. Why...? Why did it have to turn out like this...?
...
......
...
What... you don't remember anything!?
W, well... good. That's good...
Phew... ha... hahaha...
Uncle Ichi~!

There's so many people...what's this place?
What's that?
I wanna see! I wanna see it! Can we?!
Hey, what kind of story will it be?
Uncle Ichi, who's that person?
Ohhh....
Now then, we open at a laboratory deep, deeeeep within the mountains.

I... I'm no little girl anymore. And this isn't scary at all.

Make it stop... I'm afraid...
Please... Make it stop...
Make it stop... I'm afraid...
Make it stop... Please... 
No, stay away!
Eeeeek!
Don't give us that! Take a look at this!
Untranslated
You wanna explain this, Ogami?!
Goodbye. I'm going off to live by myself.
I DID turn 10 years old today. Don't come looking for me.
Stupid Uncle Ichi!n- Iris
Tomorrow is my birthday and Uncle Ichi will take me on a date to Asakusa.
I'm gonna look so pretty that he'll surely fall in love with me.
And he will kiss me in front of the fountain in the park.
Leave me alone! I don't want to see you ever again!
You don't care about me, Uncle Ichi! You don't love me!
I'm not stupid! I'm not a kid! I hate you, Uncle Ichi!
I hate you...I hate you...I haaaate you!
Sob... Uwaaaahhh...
One wrong move and that could have been a disaster. Think about what you've done.
Hmph. I didn't do anything wrong.
Iris... do you really not understand what you've done?
No. It's not my fault! I didn't do anything!
Letting your powers run wild is dangerous.
Come now, Maria, no need to be so upset... yelling will give you wrinkles, you know.
That's not going to cut it! Iris needs to take responsibility and be punished!
Ensign! These things happen because you spoil her!
Stop treating me like a kid!
It's not my fault!
Gyaaaaahhhhh!
No! I didn't do anything wrong!
No! I didn't do anything wrong!
Ogami……
Iris can be a bit difficult sometimes.
She won't open up to us if we keep treating her like a child.

This way will do just fine.
What a bunch of horse shit! I think you have a screw loose!
And you should stop shaking the whole set every time you move!

No!
Even... even when we go out, you won't go arm-in-arm with me...
I know you get bored spending time with a kid like me.
You're lying!
I knew it.
You think I'm a bother. Everyone does.
You're lying! You all think I'm a bother because I'm a kid. You all hate me!
... you hate me too, don't you Uncle Ichiro?
So... so... you love me?
If you love me... kiss me!
Right now!
Ahhh...!?
... Uncle Ichiro, you're lying...
You don't love me at all! You don't want to kiss me...
I can read your thoughts.
You... you think I'm just a little kid after all!
Liar!
... ahaha... hehehe....
Hey, Iris... can I ask you something?
Huh!?
When you jumped to Ogami... did you feel anything?
Iris.
What?
The captain's calling for ya.
Okay!
You look happy.
Yeah!! Cuz'...
We get to do our date over again! See ya!
Oh, about what you asked. When I jumped to him...
I felt something really warm. And...
And?
The rest is a se~cret! Bye-bye!
For heaven's sake, to think they'd do this to a beautiful, refined lady like myself...
*Sigh~ Leaving all this cleaning to me. I can't believe them. Are we forgetting who's fault this was?
Nnngh... nnnnnh...!
*Gasp...!
Huh? Where am I!? What happened?
... I remember I was crying in my room...
But I feel like all those bad feelings have gone away. I feel all better.
Huh? What's the matter, onii-chan? Huh? Huh? You're being weird.
You're late! It's not polite to keep a lady waiting, you know?
Yup! This is my absolute favorite dress!
What are you looking at?
Where are you going?
Huh, aren't you going to buy me something?
Look at all those people over there. I want to have a look, too!
Sniff... so you didn't have any fun at all?
Everyone thinks that of me!
You think so too. I know it!
Welcome to our shop. Good morning! What can I do for you?
Ah, Ogami, welcome! What can I do for you?
