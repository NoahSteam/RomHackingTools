Whoa… That beautiful girl… Who could she be I wonder? 
…She was in the theater late last night, so maybe she works for the theater troupe? 
But I've been here for a month and I've never even seen her… 
Wow… I really want to meet her again… 
Alright, everyone! Let's get down to some repairs! 
Wowee, Sakura. You're so fired up! 
Hmph… Aren't you even a little ashamed of the mess you made yesterday? 
…Hey, hey, Sakura! Uncle Ichiro's not here. How come? 
He was working on fixing the stage until pretty late last night… Let's let him sleep. 
Alright, everyone! Let's get down to some repairs, right? 
… 
What's wrong Sakura? You look… kinda down. 
Hmph… Could it be that you're rather ashamed of the mess you made yesterday? 
C'mon now… Could ya be a bit more positive? 
This is nuts…! Why should I have to do this kind of　manual labor? 
Well I loooooove this kind of stuff! It's so much fun, like construction work or something! 
…Ogami, what's keeping him, I wonder? 
Ain't he still sleeping? Well, it's fine right? Sometimes ya just gotta take it easy. 
It's time!! 
Everyone, stop the repairs for now. Assemble in the control room! 
Took 'em long enough! Finally, my first battle with my Koubu! 
Let's go, everyone! 
Imperial Assault Troupe Flower Division, ready to move out, sir! 
Good! The Hive of Darkness is attacking Shiba Park! 
Shiba Park…? 
If I'm not mistaken, that's where they recently finished construction on Teito Tower. 
We can't let them destroy something that important! 
Teito Tower transmits and relays radio frequencies for the whole Tokyo area! If they destroy that… 
Everything from encoded military transmissions to tea-time radio, they'll all be cut off at the source! 
But Commander, considering the distance, there's no way we can make it in time via the Koubu… 
Understood. Not to worry. This time we'll be attacking with the Shogei-maru! 
Shogei-maru? 
Finally… the Shogei-maru's maiden voyage! 
No faiiir! I'm gonna be left out again… 
You'll get to use your own Koubu soon enough Iris, try to be patient until then, alright? 
…Fine. 
Right, Ogami. Give the order to move out! 
Yes sir! 
Assault Troupe, move out! <br> Kohran, do your best! 
Imperial Assault Troupe, move out! Destination: Shiba Park! 
Roger! 
Roger! 
Sir… I'll repay you for what you did at the pool, I promise! 
I can't wait! 
Good luck, Uncle Ichiro! 
Kohran, good luck! 
…Let's do our best, Kohran. 
Let's do our best, Ogami! 
…This is the first time you've seen me in my combat uniform, right? Does it suit me? 
Of course! You look great. 
Alright, let's get going! 
Ogami! Give it your all! 
…Right! All members, board your Koubu! Get ready to attack! 
Welcome to the Flower Division, Kohran Li! From today, you're one of us. Do your best, OK? 
Th-thanks Ogami! I feel a hundred times braver after that! I feel like I can take on anything! 
Idiot! What are you standing around for? Hurry up and launch the attack! 
Y-Yes sir! All members, board your Koubu! 
So… my beautiful little Koubu… Finally, it's your turn… Let's do our best, OK? You and me! 
Alright, move out! Kohran Li, it's your time to shine!
