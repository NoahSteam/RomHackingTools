﻿﻿﻿It's a photo of Sakura. She's looking right at me. I wonder what she's thinking…
It's a photo of Sumire. This is a side of her you don't see too often.
It's a photo of Maria. …She's lost in thought and looks kind of sad…
A photo of Kanna. She looks strong and reliable. I can't wait to meet her.
A photo of Iris. She's surrounded by flowers and flashing a radiant smile.
A photo of Kohran. She's looking pretty in profile with her face dyed red by the evening sun.
A letter given to me by a customer. I was asked to give it to Sumire. I have a bad feeling about this…
Maria's pistol. This may help me escape from here…
A hair ornament. It's decorated with flowers and looks very elegant.
A pretty pendant. The delicate workmanship is gorgeous.
A hairpin for use in a traditional bun hairstyle. It would complement a formal outfit well.
This key will allow me to enter rooms I couldn't get into before.
I found this in a bedroom on the second floor. I can use it to access the back room.
A set of cups Iris asked me to get for her. They have a very stylish design.
A matchbox Iris asked me to get for her. The brand logo is very colorful.
Some knives Iris asked me to get for her. Just a normal utensil you'd use during a meal.
A prop sword and shield used onstage. They're well made and look just like the real thing.
A prop crown used onstage. It's well constructed and incredibly detailed.
A wig and costume used onstage. I wonder what kind of act could use a flashy outfit like this?
A photo of Sakura in her swimsuit. Wow, this is really something. I'm gonna treasure this.
A photo of Sumire in her stage costume. Her distinctive makeup really makes an impact.
It's a photo of Maria on stage in the military uniform from "For Love"… She's a beautiful woman disguised as a man.
A photo of Kanna in her training gear. Catching her in a private moment like this feels surprisingly intimate.
A photo of Iris in her swimsuit. She's holding a rubber ring and looks ready to have some fun. How cute.
A photo of Kohran. I don't get to see her with her braids undone very often. It's a nice look.
A photo of Ayame in a traditional outfit. I hope she'll always be as happy and content as she is here.
Ayame's gun. Why…? Why did it have to turn out like this…?
Jean-Paul the teddy bear. Iris's best friend. She always carries him with her and takes good care of him.
Whoa… That beautiful girl… Who could she be I wonder? 
…She was in the theater late last night, so maybe she works for the theater troupe? 
But I've been here for a month and I've never even seen her… 
Wow… I really want to meet her again… 
Alright, everyone! Let's get down to some repairs! 
Wowee, Sakura. You're so fired up! 
Hmph… Aren't you even a little ashamed of the mess you made yesterday? 
…Hey, hey, Sakura! Mon Frère's not here. How come? 
He was working on fixing the stage until pretty late last night… Let's let him sleep. 
Alright, everyone! Let's get down to some repairs, right? 
… 
What's wrong Sakura? You look… kinda down. 
Hmph… Could it be that you're rather ashamed of the mess you made yesterday? 
C'mon now… Could ya be a bit more positive? 
This is nuts…! Why should I have to do this kind of manual labor? 
Well I loooooove this kind of stuff! It's so much fun, like construction work or something! 
…Ogami, what's keeping him, I wonder? 
Ain't he still sleeping? Well, it's fine right? Sometimes ya just gotta take it easy. 
It's time!! 
Everyone, stop the repairs for now. Assemble in the control room! 
Took 'em long enough! Finally, my first battle with my Koubu! 
Let's go, everyone! 
Imperial Assault Troupe Flower Division, ready to move out, sir! 
Good! The Hive of Darkness is attacking Shiba Park! 
Shiba Park…? 
If I'm not mistaken, that's where they recently finished construction on Teito Tower. 
We can't let them destroy something that important! 
Teito Tower transmits and relays radio frequencies for the whole Tokyo area! If they destroy that… 
Everything from encoded military transmissions to tea-time radio, they'll all be cut off at the source! 
But Commander, considering the distance, there's no way we can make it in time via the Koubu… 
Understood. Not to worry. This time we'll be attacking with the Soaring Whale! 
Soaring Whale? 
Finally… the Soaring Whale's maiden voyage! 
No faiiir! I'm gonna be left out again… 
You'll get to use your own Koubu soon enough Iris, try to be patient until then, alright? 
…Fine. 
Right, Ogami. Give the order to move out! 
Yes sir! 
Assault Troupe, move out! <br> Kohran, do your best! 
Imperial Assault Troupe, move out! Destination: Shiba Park! 
Roger! 
Roger! 
Ensign… I'll repay you for what you did at the pool, I promise! 
I can't wait! 
Good luck, Mon Frère! 
Kohran, good luck! 
…Let's do our best, Kohran. 
Let's do our best, Ogami! 
…This is the first time you've seen me in my combat uniform, right? Does it suit me? 
Of course! You look great. 
Alright, let's get going! 
Chief! Give it your all! 
…Right! All members, board your Koubu! Get ready to attack! 
Welcome to the Flower Division, Kohran Li! From today, you're one of us. Do your best, OK? 
Th-thanks, Chief! I feel a hundred times braver after that! I feel like I can take on anything! 
Idiot! What are you standing around for? Hurry up and launch the attack! 
Y-Yes sir! All members, board your Koubu! 
So… my beautiful little Koubu… Finally, it's your turn… Let's do our best, OK? You and me! 
Alright, move out! Kohran Li, it's your time to shine!
