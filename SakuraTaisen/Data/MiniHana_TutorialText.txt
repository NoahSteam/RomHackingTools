Let's go over the rules!
To think just the two of us would play Hanafuda in my room...
Whoever wins... Let's have fun!
Thanks for participating in the Great Koi Koi Battle!
Since this is your first time playing Koi Koi...
I'll explain the rules. Listen up!
Let's start with the screen layout.
First each of us is dealt 8 cards. That's our hand.
Another 8 cards are placed face up in the middle.
That's the shared pool. We can both take cards from there.
I'll explain the rest as we play.
You have a card with a green highlight.
There's card of the same type in the middle.
They're a bit different, but the flowers are the same.
Match a card from your hand with one from the pool to take them.
Why don't you try it?
Pick a card with the d-pad or mouse.
Once the card you want appears bigger, push the button to confirm.
Great, you took a pair of cards.
Next, a card will be revealed from this pile.
If it matches another card in the pool...
Amazing! You can take another pair. Feels great, right?
The cards you took will be shown in the lower right.
There's a matching card! Why don't you take it?
If you play a non-matching card, it's tossed into the pool.
That it for your turn. Now me.
I'm also trying to form a pair.
A card is revealed. If it matches, I take it.
Like this, we keep taking turns. Easy, right?
Looks like you don't have a match!
You'll have to discard one into the pool.
Choose a card you think you won't need.
Select a card and confirm by pushing the button.
A card from the pile will be revealed after this.
Let's keep playing for now.
Look! You scored a combo!
You collected 3 cards with blue scrolls.
This combo is worth 6 points!
Whoever scores a combo first, wins.
In this case, that's you! You score the points of your combo.
Btw, points are also called "mon", after an old currency.
You can look up the different combos in the menu.
There are 12 in total. I'm sure you'll memorize them quickly.
Now, with your blue scrolls, you win this round.
If you wish, you can choose to continue!
You already have the Deer and the Butterfly card.
If you get the Boar, you'd score another combo.
This combo would be worth another 6 points.
That would bring up your total to 12 points.
If you want to secure your points, choose "I'm done."
If you want to keep going, choose "Koi Koi."
You chose "I'm done", so this round is over.
You win. The 6 points you scored are taken from me.
But it's not always gonna be so easy.
If I had scored a combo first and chosen "Koi Koi"...
Sometimes it pays off to be aggressive.
Now we'll play for real! I won't hold back!
You chose "Koi Koi"! You like to gamble, huh?
The 6 points from your blue scrolls aren't secured yet.
OK, the battle continues! Do your best!
Oh, a deer-boar-butterfly combo! What will you do now?
You chose "I'm done", so this round is over.
6 plus 6... That's 12 points!
You're good at this. Let's continue.
Oh, now I scored a combo!
I'm not chosing "Koi Koi", so the round ends here.
All the combos you made this round are lost.
Choosing "Koi Koi" can score you lots of points, but it is risky.
Luck can swing both ways. Next time you might win.
Now, let's play for real. I won't hold back this time!
