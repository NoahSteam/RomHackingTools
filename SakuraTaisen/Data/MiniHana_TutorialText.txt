Rule time!
To think we'd play Hanafuda in my room...
Whoever wins... Let's have fun!
Thanks for joining the Great Koi Koi Battle!
Since this is your first time...
I'll explain. Listen up!
First, the screen layout.
We get dealt 8 cards. That's our hand.
Another 8 are placed face up in the middle.
That's the shared pool. We take cards from there.
I'll explain the rest as we play.
See the green highlight?
There's a card of the same type in the middle.
A bit different, but the flowers are the same.
Match your card with one from the pool to take it.
Why don't you try?
Pick a card.
Once the card appears bigger, push the button to confirm.
Great, you took a pair.
Next, a card will be revealed.
If it matches another card...
Amazing! Take another pair. Feels great, right?
Your cards are in the lower right.
There's a match! Why don't you take it?
If you play a non-matching card, it's tossed into the pool.
Your turn's over. Now me.
I'm also trying to form a pair.
A card's revealed. If it matches, I take it.
And we keep taking turns. Easy, right?
Looks like you don't have a match!
You'll have to discard one.
Choose a card you won't need.
Select a card and confirm.
A card from the pile will be revealed after.
Let's keep playing.
Look, a combo!
You collected 3 cards with blue scrolls.
That's worth 6 points!
Whoever scores a combo first, wins.
In this case, that's you! You score the points of your combo.
Btw, points are also called "mon", after an old currency.
You can look up the combos in the menu.
There are 12 in all. I'm sure you'll memorize them quickly.
Now, with your blue scrolls, you win this round.
If you wish, you can continue!
You already have the Deer and the Butterfly.
If you get the Boar, you'd score another combo.
This combo would be worth another 6.
That would bring up your total to 12.
To secure your points, choose "I'm done."
To keep going, choose "Koi Koi."
You chose "I'm done", so this round is over.
You win. The 6 points you scored are taken from me.
But it's not always gonna be so easy.
If I'd scored first and chosen "Koi Koi"...
Sometimes it pays to be aggressive.
Now we'll play for real! I won't hold back!
You chose "Koi Koi"! You like to gamble, huh?
The 6 points from your blue scrolls aren't secured yet.
OK, the battle continues! Do your best!
Oh, a deer-boar-butterfly combo! What will you do now?
You chose "I'm done", so this round is over.
6 plus 6... That's 12!
You're good. Let's continue.
Oh, now I scored a combo!
I'm not choosing "Koi Koi", so the round ends here.
All the combos you made this round are lost.
Choosing "Koi Koi" can score lots of points, but it is risky.
Luck can swing both ways. Next time you might win.
Now, let's play for real. I won't hold back this time!
