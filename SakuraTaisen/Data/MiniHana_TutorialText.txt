Rule time!
To think we'd play Hanafuda in my room...
Let's have fun!
Welcome to the Great Koi Koi Battle!
Since this is your first time...
Listen up!
1st, the screen layout.
There's 8 cards, our hand.
8 more go face up in the middle.
That's the pool. We take cards from there.
I'll explain as we play.
See the green?
There's the same type in the middle.
A bit different, flowers are the same.
Match with the pool to take it.
Now try.
Pick a card.
Once the card's bigger, push to confirm.
Great.
Next, a card reveal.
If it matches...
Amazing! Another pair. Great, right?
Yours are in the lower right.
A match! Why don't you take it?
A non-matching card gets tossed into the pool.
Now my turn.
I also want a pair.
If it matches, I take it.
And keep taking turns. Easy, right?
Aw, no match!
Discard one.
Choose one you won't need.
Select and confirm.
A card will be revealed after.
Keep playing.
Look, a combo!
3 cards with blue scrolls.
6 points!
The first combo wins.
That's you! Get combo points!
AKA "mon", after old currency.
Combos are in the menu.
There's 12, you'll get them quick.
Now, with the scrolls, you win this round.
If you wish, continue!
You already have Deer & Butterfly.
If you get Boar, that's another combo.
This would be worth another 6.
Brings your total to 12!
To keep them, choose "I'm done."
To keep going, choose "Koi Koi."
You chose "I'm done", so this round is over.
You win! The 6 points are taken from me.
It's not always gonna be easy.
If I'd scored and chosen "Koi Koi"...
Sometimes it pays to be aggressive.
Now for real! I won't hold back!
You chose "Koi Koi"! You like to gamble, huh?
The 6 points from your blue scrolls aren't secured yet.
OK, the battle continues! Do your best!
Oh, a deer-boar-butterfly combo! What will you do now?
You chose "I'm done", so this round is over.
6 plus 6... That's 12!
You're good. Let's continue.
Oh, now I scored a combo!
I'm not choosing "Koi Koi", so the round ends here.
All the combos you made this round are lost.
Choosing "Koi Koi" can score lots of points, but it is risky.
Luck can swing both ways. Next time you might win.
Now, for real. I won't hold back this time!
