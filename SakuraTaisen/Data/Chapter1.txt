== Getting Started =======================================================

This section of the faq is dedicated to helping those with insufficient
Japanese knowledge get started with the game.  If you have already figured
all this out, feel free to skip to the next section.

Note that this faq is designed primarily with the Japanese Dreamcast
version in mind, although most of the material covered should apply to the
Saturn and Japanese Windows versions of the game as well.  I have not
played the Japanese or Chinese Windows versions of the game and have no
knowledge on them whatsoever; therefore this faq takes a console-oriented
stance on the game.

-- Supported hardware ----------------------------------------------------

Sakura Taisen is a Japanese Sega Saturn/Dreamcast game, and as such is
intended for use on Japanese or Asian Sega Saturn or Dreamcast consoles.
There _are_ means of playing Japanese Saturn or Dreamcast games on
consoles from other territories; however, such information is beyond the
scope of this faq.

Additionally, the Dreamcast version of Sakura Taisen includes support for
various Dreamcast peripherals.  The game makes use of the Dreamcast VMU's
LCD screen during play, so it is advisable, but not necessary, to use a VMU
with an LCD screen (as opposed to many third party VMUs or certain Sega
brand models which do not have a screen) in the first slot of the first
controller.  Also, the game requires the Dreamcast's analog pad be used. 
Sakura Taisen also supports the Puru-Puru/Jump Pack and, while the VGA box
is not directly supported, it is possible to run the game in VGA mode
using various techniques which are not recommended by Sega as they may
cause damage to your Dreamcast or monitor, and I will take no
responsibility for any such damage incurred.

-- System file maintenance (Dreamcast version only) ----------------------

When you first start up the game and press the start button, a screen will
appear asking you to select the Visual Memory Unit (hereafter referred to
as "VMU") containing the main system file you will use during play.  If a
highlighted VMU contains a Sakura Wars system file, a picture of a cherry
blossom will appear in the VMU icon; otherwise, the words 'NO DATA' will
appear.  If you press the 'A' button on such a highlighted VMU, the
game will then ask you if you wish to create a system file.  At this point,
it will be useful to point out two important Japanese words which you
should be able to recognize easily while playing Sakura Wars:

  はい   ('hai') - 'Yes'
  いいえ ('iie') - 'No'

Anyway, select 'yes' if you wish to create a new system file.  Once it is
done, the dialog box on screen will tell you not to remove that VMU during
game play while the system file is being created; immediately afterward,
you will be taken to the game's main menu screen.

Otherwise, if a system file already exists on the currently highlighted
VMU, you will have three options, indicated in the upper right corner of
the screen.  They are:

  'Y' button: Delete
  'X' button: Copy
  'A' button: Load

The 'copy' and 'delete' options should be self-explanatory.  When 'delete'
is selected, a dialog will pop up asking for confirmation.  'No' is
highlighted by default.  When 'copy' is selected you will be asked to
choose a destination VMU for the copy, followed by a confirmation prompt.
'Load' will of course start the game with the currently selected VMU
system file.

Note that it is possible to start play without a system file in use, but
any general data (e.g., which characters you've finished the game with,
mini-games you've found, etc.) will not be saved.  To do so, highlight
「開始」('Begin') in the lower right.  You will then be prompted if you
wish to start the game without using a system file.  Note that it _will_
still be possible to save your progress during game play (provided you have
sufficient VMU space).

-- Main game menu --------------------------------------------------------

Once you have chosen a system file (or opted to play without one), a
screen will appear with the following menu:

ディスク１の最初から  Start from the beginning of disc 1
セーブの続きから      Continue a saved game
帝劇の長い一日        A long day in the Imperial Theatre
インターネット        Internet (Dreamcast version only)
オプション            Option

Certain menu items may not be available.  'Start from the beginning of
disc 1' is self-explanatory.  'Continue a saved game' allows you to load a
game saved at an 'eyecatch' (pre-set points during the game at which you can
save your progress).  'A long day in the Imperial Theatre' is essentially a
"bonus area" in which you can view previously seen movies, play mini-games
you have found during game play, and the like.

Selecting the 'option' menu item brings up a screen with the following
settings:

カーソル速度   「遅い・・・速い」    Cursor speed     [ Slow . . . Fast ]
サウンド       「ステレオ/モノラル」 Sound           [ Stereo / Monaural ]
音声           「ＯＮ/ＯＦＦ」       Voice                [ ON / OFF ]
ぷるぷるぱっく 「ＯＮ/ＯＦＦ」       Puru-Puru Pack       [ ON / OFF ] *
文字スキップ   「ＯＮ/ＯＦＦ」       Message Skip         [ ON / OFF ] **
キー設定       「変更/設定確認」     Key settings  [ Change / Check settings ]

* Dreamcast version only
** Dreamcast version only; not available until the game has been completed
at least once

These should once again be pretty self-explanatory.  'Puru-Puru pack'
refers to force feedback features that occur during play; these can be
toggled on or off if a Puru-Puru or Jump Pack is installed.  'Voice' refers
to speech spoken by characters in the game.

'Message Skip,' when enabled, allows you to skip through dialogue by holding
down the R-trigger.  It is only available after the game has been finished at
least once.

'Change key settings' allows you to reconfigure buttons on the pad.  'A'
and 'B' are limited to 'confirm' (「決定」) and 'cancel' (「取り消し」),
but these functions may be swapped as desired.  'X', 'Y', 'L', and 'R'
can all be mapped to shortcut commands used during battle.  These
commands are:

移動      Movement
通常攻撃  Normal attack
防御      Defense
ため      Build up
全図      Full map
相談      Consult
決定      Confirm
決定なし  Undefined

By default, these are all undefined (「決定なし」).  The final option,
above 'EXIT,' restores the initial settings (初期決定).

'Confirm key settings' (「決定確認」) simply brings up a window listing
your current key configuration.

There is an additional option in the option menu which will not initially be
available.

Selecting 'continue from where you left off' brings up a screen with a list
of VM slots across the top and a list of files for the currently selected
VMU.  Options for choosing a saved game are the same for choosing a system
file above.  Pressing the 'B' button will allow you to return to the main
menu without having restored a saved game.

The 'Internet' option loads the built-in Dream Passport web browser,
which will bring you to the official Sakura Wars Dreamcast version homepage.
Further description of the Dream Passport software is beyond the scope of
this faq.

-- Conventions used in this faq ------------------------------------------

One of the objectives of Sakura Taisen, apart from saving the world from
plunging into chaos and destruction, is to deepen your relationship with
the members of the Floral Assault Group.  This is accomplished by talking
with characters and responding to them in ways that increase their opinion
and trust of you.  During the game, positive and negative changes in a
character's mood are indicated by corresponding chimes; in this faq, such
changes are represented by a plus sign (+) and a minus sign (-)
respectively at the beginning of the line of dialog at which one occurs.

Such changes in mood most frequently occur as a result of your response
to an onscreen prompt with several choices you can make during a
conversation.  The system is called LIPS, which stands for "Live &
Interactive Picture System" (a registered trademark of Red).  For each such
prompt that comes up during the course of this translation, I have first
listed each of the possible options, followed by the translation of the
outcome of one or more of those options.

Finally, I have included footnotes at the end of the translation which
correspond to certain lines that are numbered in curly braces.

=== Background Information ==========

The Taisho (大正) era was from 1912 - 1925 (with formal coronation of the
Taisho emperor in 1915).  It was the second era since the fall of the
Tokugawa shogunate, immediately following the Meiji (明治 "the enlightened
rule") era (1868 - 1912) and restoration.  By the end of the Meiji, western
culture was finally truly intertwining itself with the traditional culture
of Japan.

However, in the world of Sakura Taisen, things are slightly different.
This is the 太正, not 大正 Taisho era.  Most of what you may know about
Japan during this time in our world holds true; however, technology here is
heavily advanced thanks to the power of steam, the benefits of which are
seen rampant throughout Sakura Wars.  Yet unbeknownst to the complacent
populace, something dark and foreboding seeks to turn this world on its
end......

=== Chapter 1 Translation ==========

     Chapter 1
     Teito - The Flowery Assault Group {1}

Imperial Navy Ensign Mr. Ohgami Ichiro: {2}

As part of a special mission, you are hereby ordered to take up a new post as
captain of the following corps:

'The Imperial Floral Assault Group, Anti-Demon Interception Squad,
Flower-Troupe.'

Furthermore, your mission is a highly-classified one for the sake of the defense
of Teito.

You are to head to Ueno Park to join up with the corps.
                                   Imperial Army Lieutenant General {3}
                                                           Yoneda Ikki

{Hanakoji} ......Ohgami Ichiro.  As of today, you will be transferring to the
Imperial Floral Assault Group, Flower-Troupe.

{Ohgami} Yes, sir!  Ohgami Ichiro, prepared to work to the utmost limits of my
abilities, sir!

{Hanakoji} Yes......  Excellent reply.

It would not do for a politician such as myself to discuss the military secrets
of the Floral Assault Group with you here.

For further detail you should ask Lieutenant General Yoneda, who serves as
supreme commanding secretary of the Imperial Floral Assault Group.

Now then, head for Ueno Park.  I expect you to live up to the expectations I had
when I recommended you as captain.

{Ohgami} Understood, sir!  Ohgami Ichiro, now proceeding to Ueno Park!

{Hanakoji} The sanctity of Teito rests in your hands.  Do your best.

{Ohgami} Yes, sir!

* * * * *

{Ohgami} Ah, what nice weather!  And the Ueno cherry blossoms are in full bloom.

Now then......  Where do you suppose the meeting place is......?  I guess I'll
try walking around a bit more.

That reminds me......  I believe Ueno Park was where that monster disturbance
happened just a while ago......

Apparently, the one who cut down that monster, with one blow, was a young
girl......

........................

He said someone from the Imperial Floral Assault Group would come to meet me;
when do you suppose they'll show up?

What's this?  That girl......

......!  She's coming this way......

{Girl} ......Excuse me......  Are you Ensign Ohgami Ichiro?

{Ohgami} Ye-yes.  I happen to be Ohgami......

Um......  Forgive me, but, who might you be?

{Girl} I'm Shinguji Sakura.

I received instructions from Lieutenant General Yoneda to provide escort for an
Ensign Ohgami.

{Ohgami} ......From Lieutenant General Yoneda?

(I'd heard someone would be coming to meet me...... but I never would have
expected it to be a woman......)

Um, excuse me...... would you happen to be from the Imperial Floral Assault
Group!?

{Sakura} Yes!

Imperial Floral Assault Group, Flower-Troupe, Shinguji Sakura.

Pleased to make your acquaintance.

{Ohgami} Ah......  I'm Imperial Navy Ensign Ohgami Ichiro.

Still...... to think a young woman like yourself would be a member of the
squad.....  Frankly, I'm a little surprised.

{Sakura} Do you find women difficult to rely on?

{Ohgami} Ah, n-no......  It's not that......

(......I suppose only in a covert squad would it not be unusual to find female
squad members like her......)

{Sakura}......Now then, let's proceed to the Grand Imperial Theatre.

{Ohgami} Eh - theatre...... you say!?

=== LIPS 1-1 ==>

{Ohgami} I'm on duty!  Unfortunately I don't have time to spend seeing a play.

{Sakura} You're mistaken.  Inside the Grand Imperial Theatre is the Imperial
Floral Assault Group headquarters.

{Ohgami} Ehh!?  The base of a covert squad is inside a theatre!?  That can't
be......  No, wait a second?

In order to conceal oneself from the enemy's eyes, first do so from one's
allies'.  I see.

{Sakura} The essentials of the art of war, indeed.

Now then, let's proceed.
< a -

- b >
{Ohgami} First I'd like to know more about you.

{Sakura+} About me, you say......?

My name is Shinguji Sakura.  I've just come here from Sendai.  I'm a complete
newcomer who's just joined the Tei-Geki. {4}

I'm still causing trouble all the time for everyone in the Tei-Geki.

But in order to defend Teito, I intend to work hard even if it means placing my
life on the line.

{Ohgami} I see - that's an excellent attitude.  I'm relieved to hear those
words.  That is how a member of a secret corps should be.

......That would mean the Imperial Floral Assault Group has something like a
secret weapon, wouldn't it?

{Sakura} Making the 'Kohbu' work is a tough job.  But as fellow rookies, let's
do our best together. {5}

{Ohgami} (Kohbu?  Ahh...... the name of the secret weapon.  I wonder what sort
of thing it is.)

{Sakura} Come, Lieutenant General Yoneda is waiting!  Let's go!

{Ohgami} Ye-yes!  If you would, please.
< b -

- time up >
{Ohgami} (Why do I need to go to a theatre......?)

(Is she really...... a member of the Imperial Floral Assault Group?)

{Sakura-} What's the matter?  You seem distracted.

{Ohgami} O-oh, no!  It-it's nothing!

(It couldn't be...... I'm overthinking this.  This girl knew my name, didn't
she?)

{Sakura} Now then, let's go.  Lieutenant General Yoneda is waiting.

{Ohgami} Ye-yes!  If you would, please.

* * *

{Ohgami} So this is the Grand Imperial Theatre that was newly built last
year.....  I never would have expected it to be right in the middle of
Ginza...... {6}

It's a big building......

Surely, no one would notice that the headquarters of a covert squad are inside a
theatre like this......

{Sakura} Mr. Ohgami, this is your first time here, isn't it.  Now then, let's go
inside through the main lobby.

{Ohgami} Wow......  What an impressive entranceway.  Still, it seems a bit
careless not to have a lookout posted......

Still...... it's rather quiet, isn't it.

{Sakura} Well, today we're only performing at night......

{Ohgami} (Performing at night?  ......Does she mean nighttime drills?)

{Sakura} But, before long, we'll be opening up, and the audience will come
pouring back in.

{Girl} Ahah?  Big brother, are you Miss Sakura's boyfriend? {7}

{Ohgami} Huh!?

(Wh...... who is this kid!?)

{Sakura} Iris!  You mustn't tease your elders.

This is Ensign Ohgami Ichiro, newly transferred to the Imperial Floral Assault
Group.

{Ohgami} Ah...... I'm...... Imperial Navy Ensign, Ohgami Ichiro.

{Iris} Imperial Floral Assault Group, Flower-Troupe, Iris.

And this is Jean-Paul, the bear, Iris's very special friend.  Get along nice
with him.

{Ohgami} (A child like this...... is a member of a covert squad?)

{Iris} Say, Sakura......

{Sakura} What's the matter?

{Iris} This big brother has spiritual energy too......  He'll be fighting in a
'Kohbu,' won't he. {5}

{Sakura} That's right.

{Iris} Iris...... hates war......  TODO: HERE 120

{Sakura} Don't worry, Iris.  Come on, let's go to your room.  I'll read to you
from your Mother Goose book.

{Iris} Okay.

{Sakura} Ah, Ensign Ohgami.  Lieutenant General Yoneda is in the manager's
office.

Well then, I will now be excusing myself.

{Ohgami} J......just what was that girl all about?

Sakura's left, too......  That's no good.

There's nothing I can do about it.  I guess I'll just go see Lieutenant General
Yoneda myself......

* * *

{Woman's voice} Someone!  Please lend me a hand!

{Ohgami} ......Who could that be?  It sounded like a voice just came from the
dining hall......

(Wah!  ......Wh-what a bold outfit!)

{Sumire} Ah!  You there!

{Ohgami} ......My-myself, you mean!?

{Sumire} Who else is there?  Stop looking like a fool and come here!

{Ohgami} Ye- yes, ma'am......

{Sumire} I wonder if you wouldn't perhaps pick up that dropped fork and exchange
it for a new one for me?

You dare to suggest that the only daughter of Kanzaki Heavy Industries, and the
star actress of this theatre, and, and......

...the top lady of Japanese high society, I, Kanzaki Sumire, should pick up a
fork dropped on the floor!?

That is what you are saying, is it not?!  You are fired!  I shall report this to
the manager and see to it that you are fired!

{Ohgami} ......I happen to be Imperial Navy Ensign Ohgami Ichiro, transferred as
of today to the Imperial Floral Assault Group.

Fired you may say, but without a decree from the Navy's General Headquarters, I
cannot leave.

{Sumire} ............!

Ah......  My, oh, no......  O-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho......

No wonder I thought I hadn't seen a waiter like you before......  Forgive me.

Let's see - Ensign Ogawa, was it?

{Ohgami} ......Ohgami.  Um, where might Lieutenant General Yoneda be?

{Sumire} Mr. Yoneda is in the manager's office within.

{Ohgami} Through this way?  Thank you very much.
< a -

{Ohgami} Why, certainly.  ......Here, there you are.

{Sumire+} Thank you.  By the way - I, the top star here, Kanzaki Sumire, have
been cast aside...

...and before I was even aware, Miss Maria was made leader of our drama group. 
What do you think of all this?

Honestly, that old fool Yoneda!  He has no eye for people!

{Ohgami} (Huh......?)

......I happen to be Imperial Navy Ensign Ohgami Ichiro, transferred as of today
to the Imperial Floral Assault Group.

I wish to personally convey the message to Lieutenant General Yoneda......

{Sumire} ............!

Oh my, what shall I do!  How rude of me.  Ho-ho-ho-ho-ho......

Let's just keep what I said just now a secret from Mr. Yoneda!  Is that clear? 
(Chu!) {8}

{Ohgami} Waah!  Wh-what are you doing all of a sudden!?!

{Sumire} Eh-heh, there's no need to be shy.  That was just to see that the
favor's returned......  I mean, just to see you off.

{Ohgami} Um, excuse me......  Wh-where might Lieutenant General Yoneda be!?

{Sumire} Ahh, Mr. Yoneda is in the manager's office.  But is this absolutely
clear?  You are not to mention what I just said to anyone!

Do you understand, Ensign Ogawa?!

{Ohgami} ......It's Ohgami.

{Sumire} Enough, begone!!

{Ohgami} Ye- yes, ma'am......

{Sumire-} Just a moment, you!  Can you not hear what I am saying?

Cease your daydreaming, and pick up that fork right away!!

{Ohgami} ......She seemed to be a rather strict person.  Still, I finally feel
as though I've met someone who actually seems like military personnel.

Still, did she say - practice, was it......?  Would that be some sort of drill?

Now then......  I can finally have an audience with his Excellency, Lieutenant
General Yoneda.

- {after knocking} -

{Yoneda} Hey, come on in.

{Ohgami} ......Excuse me!!

As of 12:00 today, Imperial Navy Ensign Ohgami Ichiro, newly transferred to the
Imperial Floral Assault Group,

...has now arrived!

{Yoneda} Yeah, I heard the news from Count Hanakoji.  Well, now, let's just
dispense with the formal introductions.

In the first place, y'know, this is the Grand Imperial Theatre.  You can't use
that military talk.

{Ohgami} (Wh...... who is this drunken old man!?)

(Th......this man...... couldn't possibly be......!?)

{Yoneda} Well, how 'bout a round!?

General Yoneda?

{Yoneda} Idiot!  What's the big idea with this "are you really" bit!?

What's the matter, you can't figure out who a person is if he hasn't got any
medals on?!  I'm Army Lieutenant General Yoneda Ikki!

Damn fool!

{Ohgami} Fo- forgive me!

{Yoneda} Okay!  As long as you understand, that's fine enough.  Now then, I will
now entrust you with your first mission!
< a -

{Ohgami} How can you drink sake in the middle of the day?!

Are you really that Lieutenant General Yoneda?  You seem quite different from
the rumors I've heard......

{Yoneda} Rumors......?  Hey, what sort of rumors!?  Huh?  Spit it out!

{Ohgami} I had heard Lieutenant General Yoneda was a hero of the Russo-Japanese
War and the greatest strategist the Army has.

{Yoneda} The greatest strategist the Army has...... and, he's the manager of the
Grand Imperial Theatre.

And on top of that, a drunken old man......

And that's what you don't like.

{Ohgami} No......  I hadn't said that much.

{Yoneda} That is what you're saying!  But you know, Mr. Ohgami......

No matter how much distinguished military service I've performed and how many
medals hang from my chest, I've killed a whole lot of people.

Both enemies and allies......  I've killed far too many.

So, what's wrong with this?  Being the manager of a theatre!

{Ohgami} ......I understand.  But given that I have been transferred to the
Imperial Floral Assault Group......

For the harmony and safety of the citizens of Teito...... I intend to fight with
my life on the line!

{Yoneda} Splendid!  Er, rather...... that's just splendid indeed! {10} Now then,
here's your first duty!

Because when it comes down to it, this is a secret corps, after all.

{Ohgami} I see……  So I'll be in disguise for this mission.  That's just what
I'd expect of a covert squad!

Understood!  Ohgami Ichiro, now proceeding to duty!

{Yoneda} I thought I told you you don't need that formal talk!  Now go already!

{Ohgami} Yes, sir!

{Sakura} Ah, Mr. Ohgami……

{Iris} Ah…… he's spotted us.

{Ohgami} Sakura and…… Iris, was it?  What are you doing here?

{Iris} See, Sakura.  This is why Iris said "let's run!"

{Sakura} ……Well, you said, "let's go check on how he's doing," didn't you?!

angry……

{Iris} E-heh-heh, thanks.  Big brother, you're real nice, huh.

{Sakura} ……That Iris.  Tricking us with crocodile tears……  What nerve.

……That's no good.  Here I've finally just received my first official duty
and I don't even know where the reception desk is.

{Maria} Ensign Ohgami, is something the matter?

{Ohgami} You're…… Miss Maria Tachibana…… right?

{Maria} Yes, that's right.  It seems you've already met with Manager Yoneda.

{Ohgami} Yes.  I've already received my first official duty.  I was told to
change into these clothes and head for the reception desk.

Until I get used to it, I think I'd like to learn about my job a little at a
time.

{Maria+} I see.  That's an excellent attitude.

By the way, do you happen to know where the reception desk is?

{Ohgami} Ah…… that's right!  And here I meant to ask how to get there……

{Maria} ……In that case, I'll show you the way.

watched for a little longer to see how things turn out……

But you know, Hanakoji……  This secret corps…… is difficult.

We spur these women onto the battlefield, and all we can do is sit back and
watch over them.  As an Imperial soldier…… it's humiliating.

Still, the only ones who can make the 'Kohbu' work, as of now, are those girls.

That's why I'm going out of my way to shelter those girls, to protect them, and
give them freedom.

It would be wonderful if we could use that young one, but……

Ohh, it looks like he's finally come to complain.  Well then, talk to you
again……

decided.

For someone like me, who's just graduated from military academy, Captain is a
big role.  My heart raced.

I didn't care what my post was.  I was able to do a job defending peace…… 
That alone made me genuinely happy.

But…… what I was transferred to, the 'Imperial Opera Troupe'…… ……was
an opera troupe with nothing but women!

What happened…… to my job defending peace?

~ {Eyecatch 1-1} ~

=== Eyecatches Explained =========>
An 'eyecatch,' as it is called, originally refers to an image displayed on
screen during television programs just before and after a commercial break to
inform the viewer when the show is back on.  As time went on, eyecatches
evolved, especially in the case of Japanese animation, into a sort of fan
service; often they would vary from one episode to the next for the same show,
so they were a thing to look forward too even if the commercials weren't. 
Additionally, they began to be used in direct-to-video animation, where there
weren't any commercials during the program, to break up a long show at certain
plot points.  Such is the case of Sakura Taisen game series, where the eyecatch
has the additional function of allowing the player to save game progress at
preset points in the story.

At an eyecatch, the following menu appears:

セーブする       Save game
隊員の状況       Squad member status
ゲームを再開     Continue game

'Continue game' is self-explanatory.  The other two options are described as
follows.

Selecting 'save game' brings up a screen similar to the 'continue from where you
left off' screen mentioned at the beginning of this faq.  However, when you
select a saved game slot, the following menu will be visible instead:

セーブする    Save
削除する      Delete
キャンセル    Cancel

Once again, choosing either 'save' or 'delete' will bring up a dialog box asking
you to confirm that operation.  Be careful and make sure you have selected the
right file and the right menu option.  'Cancel' obviously does just that.

Selecting 'squad member status' brings up a display of currently available
Flower-Troupe members and a qualitative description of each member's mood.  The
members are listed in order of their trust for you, from left-to-right and
top-to-bottom, numbered one through six.  The member who is in the number one
(upper-left) position trusts you the most and is who you are most likely to end
up with at the end of the game, but the order will change depending on the
actions you take.

As stated, a description is provided for each member's mood.  These descriptions
come in the following three variants:

気力充実！       Full of spirit!
ふつうの気分     Normal mood
ごきげんななめ   In a bad mood

There is more to the 'squad member status' screen, but as it is not yet
available, it will be discussed later.

But more importantly…… I'm sorry about just now.  I didn't mean to make so
much noise……

{Ohgami} No, no, it's all right.  More importantly…… what is it, this late
at night?

{Sakura} Um, Mr. Ohgami……

The truth is, I was instructed to have you make the nighttime rounds in the
theater……

I was told so by Manager Yoneda……

{Ohgami} Nighttime…… rounds?

{Sakura} Yes……  I'm terribly sorry for bringing it up so suddenly, but…… 
Please.

Well then, shall we go?

fine with me.  I'll make the rounds.

Mr. Ohgami……

What happened to the Mr. Ohgami who was so full of life when I first met him in
Ueno Park?

I…… don't want to look at you the way you are now!

{Ohgami} Sakura…………  I wonder if I was a little too stubborn……

……There's nothing I can do about it.  I guess I'll go to sleep for today.

{Sakura} And I as well.  Now then, shall we go at once?

{Ohgami} Ah, Maria.

{Maria} Ensign, and Sakura……  What are you doing at this hour?

{Sakura} Making the nighttime rounds.  Miss Maria, what are you doing at this
hour yourself?

{Maria} I've come to return a book I borrowed.

{Sakura} Hehh, what did you borrow?

{Maria} 'Crime and Punishment'……

=== LIPS 1-22 ==>

{Ohgami} 'Crime and Punishment,' huh……  I believe that's Tosltoy, isn't it.

{Maria} ……That's incorrect.  The author of 'Crime and Punishment' is
Dostoevsky.

{Ohgami} Huh…………  Was that so?

{Maria-} ……Ensign.  You won't impress me by pretending to know.

Now then, I must be excusing myself.  Good luck with your patrol.

{Ohgami} 'Crime and Punishment,' huh……  I believe that's Dostoevsky, isn't

you.

{Sakura} Mr. Ohgami, that's amazing!  I'm impressed!

{Maria} Now then, I must now be excusing myself.

Ensign, Sakura, good luck making the rounds.  Now then, good night.

{Sakura} Mr. Ohgami, shall we be getting back to the patrol?

{Maria} You're not familiar with it?  It's the work of a Russian novelist named
Dostoevsky.

These archives are free for you to borrow from, so please feel free to make use
of them yourself.

Ensign, Sakura, good luck making the rounds.  Now then, good night.

{Sakura} Mr. Ohgami, shall we be getting back to the patrol?
< time up -
<== LIPS 1-22 ===
<== Archives (書庫) ===

=== Archives (書庫) after seeing Maria there previously ==>
{Ohgami} This was the archives, wasn't it.  I'd like to borrow a book from here
sometime myself.

{Sakura} For now, there doesn't seem to be anything out of the ordinary.  Let's
go, Mr. Ohgami.
<== Archives (書庫) after seeing Maria there previously ===

=== Salon (サロン) ==>
{Sakura} This is the salon.  Everyone in the Flower-Troupe gathers here often.

{Ohgami} A place of relaxation for everyone, then.

{Sakura} Yes, that's right.  I'd like to stop here and have some tea, but…….

We still have the patrol to take care of……  Shall we go?
<== Salon (サロン) ===

=!! Terrace (テラス) (automatic event) !!>
{Ohgami} Huh?  Sakura's…… gone?

Oh, Sakura…… so this is where you were……

{Sakura} Mr. Ohgami…………  Please take a look outside from here.

{Ohgami} Wow……  It's Ginza at night.

{Sakura} I…… think the city lights are amazing.

{Ohgami} Why is that……?

{Sakura} They're not lights meant to be beautiful or showy, and yet they're so
pretty.

And together with all the other lights, they make such beautiful nighttime
scenery.

I want to shine on the stage, just like those lights……

{Ohgami} …………

{Sakura} And, like the city lights that shine down on the paths the people walk
as they go along the street…… ……I want to be a strong, warm light.

……I'm sorry, Mr. Ohgami.  I didn't mean to take up so much of your time
while we're in the middle of making the rounds……

Come, let's go back on patrol.
<!! Terrace (テラス) (automatic event) !!=

=== Hall (ホール) ==>
{Sakura} This is the hall, the entrance to the second floor audience seating. 
It's designed to allow air in from the lower level.

{Ohgami} Still, that's a large chandelier, isn't it……

{Sakura} Miss Sumire said it wasn't so great, though.

{Ohgami} That sounds just like what Sumire would say……

……There doesn't seem to be anything out of the ordinary, so let's go
someplace else.
<== Hall (ホール) ===

=== Second floor audience seating (二階客席) ==>
{Sakura} This is the second floor audience seating.

{Ohgami} Wow……  That's a really impressive view from here, huh.

{Sakura} There are special seats to be used by upper-class guests up here too.

{Ohgami} I see……  That's quite impressive.

{Sakura} There doesn't seem to be anything out of the ordinary.  Let's go, Mr.
Ohgami.
<== Second floor audience seating (二階客席) ===

=== Sakura's room (さくらの部屋) ==>
{Sakura} This is my room.

{Ohgami} Hehh……

{Sakura} Please come and visit sometime.  But for today, let's go on with the
patrol.
<== Sakura's room (さくらの部屋) ===

=== Maria's room (マリアの部屋) ==>
{Ohgami} This is…… Maria's room, huh.

{Sakura} Miss Maria's Father is from Russia.

- {after knocking} -
{Maria} Who is it?

{Ohgami} Um……  It's Ohgami……

{Maria} ……Ensign.  It goes against common sense to call upon a woman's room
this late at night.

{Sakura} ……She got angry at you, huh.

{Ohgami} ……There's no helping it.  Let's continue the patrol.
<== Maria's room (マリアの部屋) ===

=== Empty room (空室) between Sakura and Maria's rooms ==>
{Sakura} I've been told this room belongs to Flower-Troupe member Miss
'Kirishima Kanna.'

I haven't met her yet, but I'm told she practices karate and is currently on a
training journey even as we speak.

{Ohgami} She practices karate, and she's on a training journey……  Th-that
sounds pretty impressive.

{Sakura} Mr. Ohgami, let's continue making the rounds.
<== Empty room (空室) between Sakura and Maria's rooms ===

=== Sumire's room (すみれの部屋) ==>
{Ohgami} So this is Sumire's room.

{Sakura} The decorating in Miss Sumire's room is extremely gorgeous.

- {after knocking} -

{Sumire} Yes.  Who is it?

{Ohgami} Um……  It's Ohgami……

{Sumire} ……I am going to sleep now, so if there's something you wish to talk
about, I will hear it tomorrow.

{Ohgami} ……I- I understand.

……Well, there's nothing we can do about that.  Shall we continue the rounds?
<== Sumire's room (すみれの部屋) ===

=== Iris's room (アイリスの部屋) before going downstairs ==>
{Ohgami} This is…… Iris's room, huh.

{Sakura} Iris's room is full of stuffed animals.

-{after knocking}-
{Ohgami} …………There's no response.  Is she not in, I wonder?

{Sakura} It couldn't be……  It's already this late.  Don't you suppose she's
just asleep?
<== Iris's room (アイリスの部屋) before going downstairs ===

=== Empty room (空室) to the left of Iris's ==>
{Sakura} I've been told this room belongs to Flower-Troupe member Miss 'Ri
Kohran.'

I haven't met her yet, but I'm told she was born in China.

{Ohgami} Heh……  I wonder what she's like.

{Sakura} Mr. Ohgami, let's continue making the rounds.
<== Empty room (空室) to the left of Iris's ===

=== Empty room (空室) next to Ohgami's ==>
{Ohgami} This room……  Just whose is it?

{Sakura} I have no idea……  The truth is, I don't really know myself.

But it is locked, and we have no way of investigating.

{Ohgami} There's nothing we can do about it.  Shall we go?
<== Empty room (空室) next to Ohgami's ===

=== Captain's quarters (隊長室) ==>
{Ohgami} ……This is my room.

{Sakura} We're not yet finished with the patrol.  Come on, let's go.
<== Captain's quarters (隊長室) ===

=!! After first coming downstairs (automatic event) !!>
{Sakura} Iris!

{Ohgami} What's the matter, Iris!?  At so late an hour……

{Iris} Big brother……  Sakura……

{Sakura} What's wrong, Iris?  Go on, tell us.

{Iris} Well you see……  Jean-Paul's missing……

Iris is pretty sure…… she left him behind somewhere……

Sniff……  Jean-Paul's probably all alone right now.  Sniff……  How
sad……

{Ohgami} Iris…………

{Sakura} Don't worry, Iris.  You'll find him soon tomorrow, once it's light.

Now, it's late.  Go back to your room for today.

{Iris} Sniff…………  Okay……  I will………………

{Sakura} It would help if we knew what rooms she had been in during the
day……

……Mr. Ohgami, shall we be going now?
<!! After first coming downstairs (automatic event) !!=

=== Night duty room (宿直室) ==>
{Sakura} This is the night duty room.  Apparently the previous patrolman would
stay here during the night.

{Ohgami} So now I'm doing the night watch instead.  I guess defending the peace
of Teito wasn't my job after all……

{Sakura} …………Shall we go, Mr. Ohgami?
<== Night duty room (宿直室) ===

=== Costume room (衣装部屋) ==>
{Sakura} This is the costume room.  We have a lot of costumes here that we use
during our performances.

{Ohgami} Heh……  That's impressive.

{Sakura} There doesn't seem to be anything out of the ordinary here.  Let's go.
<== Costume room (衣装部屋) ===

=== Dressing room (楽屋) ==>
{Ohgami} So this is the dressing room, huh…………

{Sakura} Ah!  Mr. Ohgami!!  Iris's Jean-Paul is over there!

=== Dressing room Click-LIPS ==>
- Look at the teddy bear >
{Ohgami} There's no mistake.  It's Iris's Jean-Paul all right.

{Sakura} Thank goodness……  Let's bring it to her at once.

{Sakura+} Thank you very much for going out of your way to take me to my room.

{Ohgami} No, no, this is nothing.  Well, good night.

{Ohgami} ……Eh?

three more rooms……

dressing room.

{Iris} Ah!  Jean-Paul!!

{Sakura} You mustn't leave your special friends behind.

{Iris+} Big brother……  Sakura……  Thank you so much!

{Sakura} Now then, it's late, so…… good night.

{Sakura} Eh!?  Really?  Wh-what sort of bromide was it?

{Ohgami} Here, this is the one.

{Sakura+} ……It's true.  It's kind of…… embarrassing.

{Ohgami} This is where I did the ticket-clipping earlier today.  I never would

=== Kitchen (厨房) ==>
{Sakura} This is the kitchen.  We even do some cooking here ourselves from time

going.
<== Prop room (道具部屋) ===

=== Large prop room (大道具部屋) ==>
{Sakura} This is the large prop room.

{Ohgami} Large props?

{Sakura} Stage sets and backdrops are referred to as large props.  This is the

I will get a proper response from Lieutenant General Yoneda's own lips!

{Yoneda} Ohh, Ohgami.  What's going on?

{Ohgami} (Does this man…… even drink sake outdoors?)

Lieutenant General Yoneda.  I have something I'd like to ask of you……

{Yoneda} I'm the Manager, the ma-na-ger.  Inside this theater, you cut out the
'Lieutenant General.'

So……  What is you wanted to ask?  Huh?  Go on and say it.

{Ohgami} Yes, sir.  First of all……

{Yoneda} W-wait!  ……I- I just remembered!

{Ohgami} ……Wh- what's the matter!?  Lieutenant General…… I mean,
Manager!

Could it be…… about the Imperial Floral Assault Group?  So you've finally
sobered up!

{Yoneda} I was on my way to the latrine……  That was close, that was close.

{Ohgami} ……Manager Yoneda……  Really……  Please cut out the jokes
already!

{Yoneda} Ohgami, I'll hear what you have to say when I get back.

Until then, you go watch the Flower-Troupe rehearse or something.

{Ohgami} The latrine, huh……  This doesn't help me at all.  What should I do?

{Ohgami} It's a magnificent desk.  There are pictures on top of it.

……Hm?  What's this photograph……?

This person joking around here appears to be Manager Yoneda, but……

Who in the world could the other three be……?

{Ohgami} That's impressive armor……

{Ohgami} 'The Imperial Opera Troupe'……  No matter how many times I look at
it, that's what's written there.

{Ohgami} ………………

Just when is the Manager going to return?

Is he drinking himself even further drunk in the latrine?  ……No, it couldn't
be.

It's foolish to keep on wasting time here.  I guess I'll go watch the
Flower-Troupe rehearse.

{Ohgami} That's true……  Since I have the free time, maybe I'll try going to
the reception desk……

{Ohgami} Ah……!  There's Sumire.

All right……  I guess I'll try asking Sumire something.

{Sumire} My, Ensign.  Good morning.

{Ohgami} Hey, good morning.  You're taking the day off to relax today?

{Sumire} Would that I could……  I have rehearsal onstage starting now.

I'm scheduled to practice the dance with Miss Sakura over again carefully.

{Ohgami} ……Sounds like fun.  I'm jealous.

{Sumire} ……In all honesty, I don't care for rehearsal and the like.

But since failure befits a star even less……

Well, I should be getting to the stage, so…… please excuse me.

{Ohgami} ……Rehearsal, huh.

……I want work too.  I can't stand not having anything to do.

{Iris} Ah, big brother!

{Ohgami} Hey, Iris.

{Iris} Hey, big brother.  Let's all go to the upcoming flower-viewing {22}
together.

{Ohgami} That sounds nice.  Yesterday the cherry blossoms in Ueno Park were in
full bloom.

{Iris} Yeah……  But you know, Iris is happier more about being able to go
with big brother than about the flowers.

{Ohgami} Is that so?  ……Thank you.

{Iris}  That's called 'taking the drum over the flowers,' isn't it.

{Ohgami} Iris……  That's called 'taking the dumplings over the flowers.' {23}

{Iris} Eh-heh-heh……  Is that so.

……Well, Iris is going now!  Bye-bye, big brother!

{Ohgami} ……This…… is the place where I work now……

a covert squad.

Despite that…… why have I been put to work clipping tickets?  This isn't
what I was told.

{Maria} Ensign.  Ticket-clipping is a magnificent job.  What's more……

I know - a world where pleasure does not exist…… a world where one must
fight to stay alive……

I don't want to make this Teito a city where all the smiles are gone.

{Sumire} Miss Sakura!  Your footwork is all wrong!

{Ohgami} Oh……  They're really going at it.

So behind those beautiful-looking plays, there's everyday rehearsal like
this……

{Sumire} Waah!

{Ohgami} Wh-what!?

{Sakura} I'm sorry!!

{Sumire} Miss Sakura!

Do you not find it rude to trample on the hem of someone's kimono!?

{Sakura} I'm sorry.

{Sumire} Honestly, this is why I cannot stand these country types.

So vulgar…… and crude……

Now then, let's start over once more from the beginning.

{Sakura} "Forgive me ever so much!"

{Sumire} You brat……!

Miss Sakura, this is how one deals with someone who can't understand things
explained to them in words!

{Ohgami} You two……  Cut out the fighting.

I don't know much about the stage, and I have no intention of interfering with
your rehearsal.

But……  In a theater group, isn't teamwork what's important?  Let's just cut
out…… the fighting.

{Iris} But, you were saying terrible things too, Sumire!

{Maria} At any rate……  Stop the fighting!

We can't be arguing all the time……

{Sakura} I'm sorry.

{Sumire} ……Hmph!  I will just leave at that for today!

{Ohgami} (…………It seems they've managed to quell the fighting.)

- a - All right.  What is it?
- b - No, you listen to what I have to say!
- time up -
=
- a >
{Ohgami} All right.  What is it?

{Sakura} Before you came here, Mr. Ohgami, Manager Yoneda said this to me.

The role of captain of the Flower-Troupe can't be performed by a mere soldier. 
No, a mere soldier must not be allowed to perform it……

We mustn't allow battles in which we sacrifice human lives for the sake of
victory to continue……

That's why…… the person serving the role of captain of the Flower-Troupe
must be someone who, for the Flower-Troupe…… for this theater……

…and for his livelihood here - he has to be someone who can show love, he
said……

That's why Manager Yoneda put you to work clipping-tickets.

{Ohgami} …………So that's how it was.

{Sakura} Mr. Ohgami.  I have a request of you too.

Please, accept this theater…… and us, the Flower-Troupe…… and come to
like us!

And…… please fight together with us, as our Captain!

{Ohgami} Fight……  Fight, you say……  Against who……?

{Sakura} Th-that's……
< a -

- b >
{Ohgami} No, you wait.  You listen to what I have to say.

{Sakura} A……all right.

{Ohgami} When I first heard about this covert squad, in all honesty, my heart
leapt.

I was going to be able to work to defend peace.  When I thought about that……
I was so happy.

But despite that……  What……  Just what am I doing in a theater!?!

Please tell me, Sakura!  For what purpose have I come to this theater!?

{Sakura} Th-that's……
< b -
<== LIPS 1-28 ===

{Sakura} …………!

{Ohgami} Wh-what?  What's this alarm!?

{Sakura} Mr. Ohgami, we've got to move out!

{Ohgami} Move out!?  Wh-what are you talking about!?

{Sakura} The Imperial Floral Assault Group, Flower-Troupe, is moving out!  Come
on, let's go!

* * *

{Maria} All members of the Imperial Floral Assault Group, Flower-Troupe,
assembled!

{Yoneda} Mm, well done!

{Ohgami} Ma-Manager Yoneda……  And everyone else……  Wh-what is this!?

{Yoneda} Ohgami, the opera troupe is on break.  The Imperial Floral Assault
Group has returned to its original duty!

……I'm sorry for trying to deceive you.

But I wanted to test you to see whether you were appropriate as Captain of a
covert squad.

{Ohgami} Wh-what in the world is this place?

{Yoneda} This is the core of the Imperial Floral Assault Group.  ……The
underground command room.

{Ohgami} Manager Yoneda!  The Floral Assault Group…… the Floral Assault
Group really did exist, didn't it!?

{Yoneda} Of course……  The opera troupe is no more than our disguise to the
outside world.

Now then, allow me to introduce you once again.  These girls, who will be your
subordinates, are the squad members of the Imperial Floral Assault Group,
Flower-Division.

{Sakura} Mr. Ohgami……  If you're with me, I feel like I can fight to the
very limits of my abilities!

As fellow rookies in the Imperial Floral Assault Group, let's do our best!

{Iris} Big brother, let's do our best!

--- If Sumire is smiling -->
{Sumire} Ensign, that battle outfit…… looks quite good on you.
<-- If Sumire is miling ---

--- If Sumire is not smiling -->
{Sumire} Now then, let us just see…… how skillful the Ensign is.
<-- If Sumire is not smiling ---

{Maria} Ensign.  I haven't yet acknowledged you as Captain.

When I've been able to understand the way you think, and the way you feel……
then I'll be able to call you Captain.

{Ohgami} ……I understand.  Everyone, I'm counting on you!

Chief Yoneda.  Who is our enemy?

{Yoneda} I'm sure even you've heard the rumors.

The mysterious organization that threatens Teito, utilizing mechanical troops
called the 'Masou Kihei'……{24}

Their name…… is the 'Kuronosukai.' {25}

{Ohgami} Kuronosukai……?

{Iris} Sakura, you know, beat one of those Masou Kihei in Ueno Park the very day
she came to Tokyo.

{Sakura} Iris!  I thought I told you that was a secret!

{Ohgami} What?  Then…… the young girl who defeated that monster was Sakura!?

{Yoneda} That's right.  But there's a limit to how far you can manage against
the Masou Kihei in the flesh……

And that - is where we come in.  We have a powerful weapon too.  Let me show you
to the underground hangar.

{Ohgami} Wh……what are these!?

{Yoneda} These are the secret weapons upon which the Imperial Floral Assault
Group prides itself…… the psycheon armor, 'Kohbu!'

{Ohgami} Psycheon…… armor? {26}

{Yoneda} Yeah……  Mechanical armor, so to speak, that can only be made to
work by those who possess powerful spiritual energy.

The ones who have that power are the Flower-Troupe…… and you.

……Now then, your Kohbu is the white one.  Go on and get inside it.

The Kuronosukai have been sighted in the same place as last time, Ueno Park.  I
want you to head to the scene aboard our bullet train!

{Ohgami} Yes, sir!

{Iris} Iris doesn't have a Kohbu yet, so she'll be staying home, but……

Big brother, do your best!

{Ohgami} ……I see, it's really a suit of armor right down to the letter…… 
All right!  With these we'll be able to make it!

{Sakura} ……Mr. Ohgami, give the order to move out!  Let's defend Ueno Park
from the hands of the Kuronosukai!

{?????} You!

{Sa'tan} …………

{Flower-Troupe} Imperial Floral Assault Group, go forth!

{?????} Imperial Floral Assault Group, is it?  What nonsense!

{Sa'tan} Interesting……  I'll take care of things here……

{?????} Hmm……  We'll leave it up to you.

{Sa'tan} We'll just see the extent of your ability!

{Sakura} We will show no forgiveness for those who threaten the sanctity of
Teito!

{Sumire} Come, come at me from wherever you may be!

{Maria} Ensign Ohgami, these are the Kuronosukai.

Now then, I will hereby begin teaching you how to operate the Kohbu, so please
pay close attention.

=== LIPS 1-30 ==>
- a - Please do.
- b - I already know.
- time up -
=
- a >
{Maria} First, Sakura, let's start with you.

As Sakura just demonstrated, you select your destination point from the field of
allowable movement.

Sakura, attack!

{Sakura} Yes, ma'am!

{Maria} You attack by choosing your target from your allowable attack range, as
shown.

You can perform two actions during one turn.  She's just completed a 'movement'
and an 'attack,' so her turn is over.

Next is my turn.

When your spirits are built up to their maximum level, you can unleash a special
attack. {27}

Special attacks are powerful, but when used your spirits are reduced to zero.

It is also possible to build up your spirits as I have demonstrated.  And they
rise when you receive damage as well.

{Sumire} Hm-hm-hm……  Ensign.  It is finally time for the arrival of our star
performer.

Please watch carefully, if you would, as I demonstrate…… the very number of
high-class, magnificently beautiful performances I am capable of.

{Maria} Wait, Sumire.  You restore the damage done to Sakura's unit.

{Sumire} Honestly……  This was to be my turn; why should I have to sacrifice
it for the sake of a country girl like this?

{Sakura} Excuse me for being a country girl!

{Maria} The Kohbu are equipped with facilities for recovering the amount of
damage dealt to them.

You may repair not only your own unit, but your comrades' units as well.

There is a limit to the number of uses, so please be careful.

Additionally, you may 'defend' yourself to diminish the amount of damage dealt
to you by the enemy.

'Defense' is effective until your next turn comes.

During battle, you may perform two actions at once, but you can only perform one
action from a given hierarchy.

Normal attacks and special attacks are both part of the same 'attack' hierarchy,
so you can't perform one immediately after the other.

'Building up spirits,' 'defense,' and 'recovery' are all part of the same
'defense' hierarchy, so you can't perform two of them successively.

You are free to choose the order of your actions, so you may attack after moving
or move after attacking.

Now then, from here on, you will be giving us the orders.

First, let's destroy all of the enemy's Masou Kihei, the 'Wakiji.' {28}
< a -
<== LIPS 1-30 ===

=== Battle Explained =========>
Battle is turn-based and takes place on a grid environment.  As described above,
you may only perform at most two actions per each unit's turn, and both may not
be part of the same hierarchy.  Once you've learned what the
various menu items are, battle should be pretty easy to get accustomed to.

--- Battle Menu ----------

--- Movement (移) --------
-- Movement (移動) --
Upon selecting the movement command, the range of possible movement for the
given unit will be highlighted.  After selecting your destination point, the
unit will move there; at that point, you are given an opportunity to cancel the
movement with the 'B' button or confirm the movement with the 'A' button.  You
may speed up the actual movement animation by pressing the 'A' button
(additionally, the 'R' trigger in the Dreamcast version), even during an enemy's
movement.

-- Return (もどる) (Dreamcast version only) --
Available only in the Dreamcast version is the ability to return to your
original location after making a movement.  Originally introduced in Sakura Wars
2 on the Sega Saturn, selecting this option whisks the current unit back to
where it originally was at the beginning of its current turn, allowing you to
choose a different movement destination.  Obviously, this command is available
only after moving the unit.

--- Attack (攻) --------
-- Normal (通常) --
Upon selecting the normal attack command, your given attack range will be
highlighted, and a cursor will appear over the nearest potential target, if
there is one.  After initially choosing your primary target, that square and any
additional squares besides that will be affected by the attack you have elected
to perform will then be highlighted, and you will be given the opportunity to
cancel the attack with the 'B' button or confirm it with the 'A' button. 
Attacks vary in nature, range, and power depending on the attacking unit.  You
cannot damage your own units with your own attacks.

-- Special (必殺) --
Special attacks are performed in exactly the same manner as normal attacks, but
require that your spirit (気合) meter be completely filled; after the attack,
the meter is drained to zero.  Like normal attacks, special attacks very
depending on the attacking unit.

--- Defense (防) --------
-- Build up (ため) --
This option is only available when the current unit's spirit level meter is not
max, in which case choosing it will perform the 'build up' action and cause the
unit's spirit level to rise.  The amount the given unit's spiritual level rises
depends on its stats and the pilot's trust in you.

-- Defend (防御) --
Choosing this option significantly decreases all damage received until that
unit's next turn.

-- Recover (回復) --
Recovery may only be performed twice per unit per battle.  When this option is
chosen, you may select either the currently active unit or one of any unit
immediately (but not diagonally) adjacent to it, and a fair amount of that
unit's endurance level is restored.

--- Information (情) --------
-- Information (情報) --
Selecting this option allows you to hover the cursor over any unit on the
battlefield, enemy or ally, and view that unit's stats.

The unit's stat window is laid out as follows:

              Machine Name

耐久   Endurance     Current / Max
気合   Spirit        Current / 100

             攻撃 Attack   防御 Defense   移動 Movement
操者 Pilot         a              d              g

                ----           ----           ----
合計 Total         x              y              z

必殺 Special attack name

'Trust' generally only applies to Flower-Troupe members.
If 「なし」('nashi') is listed for the special attack name, the unit has no
special attack.

-- Full Map (全図) --
Choosing this option displays a full map of the entire battlefield, allowing you
to cycle through the positions of all units.

-- Consultation (相談) --
Choosing this option will cause a member of the Imperial Floral Assault Group to
remind you of your current mission.

--- End Turn (終了) --------
-- Standby (待機) --
Self-explanatory; this option allows you to end the current unit's turn
prematurely.

--- Special (特) (Ohgami only) ---
-- Cover (かばう) --
Available only during Ogami's turn.  This allows you to select a Flower Group
member to protect from any attack.  Selecting Ogami effectively deactivates the
'cover' command.  When a member unit being covered by Ogami's is attacked,
Ogami's unit will appear in its place and nullify the damage.  If both Ogami's
and the covered unit are in the same enemy attack range, neither unit will
receive damage.  This can be performed up to eight times per battle. 
Additionally, depending on the character and the current chapter, this can
provide a boost to her mood.

--- The start button menu --------
The start button menu appears whenever you press 'start'.  Pressing 'start'
again closes it.  The available options are as follows:

再戦 Restart Battle
中断 Suspend Battle (Dreamcast version only)
操作 Options

-- Restart Battle (再戦) --
Selecting this option brings up a prompt asking you whether you wish to restart
the battle from the beginning.  By default, 'no' (いいえ) is selected.

-- Suspend Battle (中断) (Dreamcast version only) --
Available only in the Dreamcast version, this option allows you to save your
current position in battle and return to the title screen.  Note that saving
your battle position requires a considerable amount of space on your memory
card, and only one such save can be made per memory card.

-- Options (操作) --
Brings up the title screen's option menu.

=== Translation Notes ==========

{1} 'Teito' (帝都) literally means 'the Imperial Capital,' but since it is
generally treated as a place name, I've taken the liberty of leaving it as-is.

{2} Ranks are translated to their modern American counterparts, and therefore
may not be technically correct for the time in which Sakura Wars takes place
(the 1920s).  Ohgami's rank, 'shou'i' (「少尉」) is the lowest of the 'ikan'
(「尉官」) rankings, which, in the military (as opposed to the 'Jieitai,' or
Japanese Self-Defense Force), progress from 'shou'i' to 'chuu'i' (「中尉」)
followed by 'tai'i' (「大尉」).  According to the 'EXCEED Wa'ei Jiten,' this
rank translates to 'second lieutenant' in the British or American Armies,
'acting sublieutenant' in the British Navy, and 'ensign' in the American Navy. 
As Ohgami is a Naval officer, I have, for better or for worse, chosen the last
of these translations.

{3} Yoneda's rank, 'chuujou' (「中将」), is the second in the 'joukan'
(「将官」) rankings, which follow a progression similar to that of the 'ikan'
ranking (c.f. note {2}).  It corresponds to 'lieutenant general' in both the
British and American Armies.

{4} This entire episode is replete with puns which don't translate well into
English.  'Tei-Geki,' when written 「帝劇」, is an abbreviation for both
'Dai-Teikoku Gekijou' ('The Grand Imperial Theater'); when written 「帝撃」, it
is short for 'Teikoku Kagekidan' ('The Imperial Floral Assault Group').  (C.f.
note {17}.)

{5} 'Kohbu' (「光武」) literally means 'warrior of light.'

{6} Ginza (「銀座」), which originally meant 'silver mint' and was so named for
the silver coin mint built there under the Edo Shogunate, is "the most
prestigious and fashionable shopping/dining town in Tokyo" and is largely
considered one of the largest commercial centers in Tokyo.  For more
information, consult the Ginza Concierge (http://www.ginza.co.jp/index_e.html).

{7}  For those of you who may be unfamiliar with this practice, in Japan it is
common to refer to complete strangers with familial terms, usually based on the
other person's age.  For example, a young man would be referred to as 'oniisan'
or 'big brother.'  As you might guess, of course, it may also be used as
something of a term of endearment.  Iris uses and will continue to use the term
in this sense.

{8} 'Chu' is onomatopoeia, representing the sound made when planting a kiss on
someone.

{9} The Russo-Japanese War was fought in the years 1904-5.  It "marked the first
time an Asian power had defeated a European power in modern times,
establish[ing] Japan as a major force in world affairs"
(http://www.ox.compsoc.net/~gemini/simons/historyweb/russo-war.html).

{10} 'Kekkou' (「結構」) can be translated as 'splendid,' but alone (at least in
this circumstance) it may sound somewhat formal.  In what appears to be an
attempt to mask any trace of such formality, Yoneda catches himself with
something of a play on words, 'kekkouke-darake' (「結構毛だらけ」), which
literally means 'covered with kekkou-fur.'  The 'ke-darake' is simply a free
association from the 'ke' in 'kekkou.'  The resultant expression then has a
somewhat derisive feel to it, representing Yoneda's apparent downplay of
Ohgami's rigid military formality.  Unfortunately, this didn't come across too
effectively in the translation.

{11} 'A flower in each hand' (「両手に花」'ryoute ni hana') is a Japanese
expression which simply means having 'two blessings at once' or a beautiful
woman on either side of oneself.

{12} 'The Eve of Dame Camelia,' or 'Tsubaki-Hime no Yuu' (「椿姫の夕」), is the
Japanese title of Verdi's opera 'La Traviata,' based on Dumas's novel 'La Dame
aux Camelias.'  'Tsubaki' (「椿」) means 'camellia.'

{13} 'Flower-Troupe' is probably the best translation for 'Hana-Gumi'
(「花組」).  Since '-gumi' simply means 'group' in the general sense, it could
be used either to mean a troupe of soldiers or a troupe of actors.

{14} A bromide is a chemical compound of an ion of the halogen bromine with a
more electropositive element or radical, e.g. silver.  Silver bromide (AgBr) is
a highly photogenic material used in photographic film.  In the more common
sense, 'bromide,' which refers to collectible photographs or pictures that
resemble oversized trading cards, most likely comes from 'bromide paper,'
photographic printing paper with silver bromide emulsion.

{15} A 'sen' (「銭」) is a unit of currency worth one hundredth of a yen.

{16} 'Kagekidan,' when written 「華撃団」, as Ohgami has been saying it up to
this point, means 'floral assault group.'  However, Iris's speech is written in
hiragana (the Japanese syllabary, sort of analogous to an alphabet), so the
meaning of the word is not immediately evident, hinting at an alternate writing
(and hence meaning) which will be made clear later.  (C.f. note {18}.)

{17} A 'katusha' ('katyusha'? 「カチューシャ」) is a hairband worn in the front
of the head that curves from one ear to the other; this is what Sumire is
wearing in her hair.  The term comes from the name of the heroine of the play
based on Tolstoy's novel 'Voskresenia' ('Resurrection,' or in Japanese,
'Fukkatsu' (「復活」)), played, rather fittingly for Sakura Wars, by the actress
Matsui Sumako in the Taisho era.

{18} 'Teikoku Kagekidan' is a play on words central to all of Sakura Wars. 
'Teikoku' (「帝国」) simply means 'empire.'  'Kagekidan,' however, can mean one
of two different things in the context of Sakura Wars depending on how it is
written.  Written 「華撃団」, it translates to 'Floral Assault Group,' to which
Ohgami originally believed he was being transferred.  Written 「歌劇団」, it
means 'opera troupe.'  As usual, the pun doesn't translate into English, but I
tried my best matching the sounds in 'assault group' with 'opera troupe.'

It is perhaps worth mentioning that Sakura Wars's Imperial Opera Troupe seems to
bear more than a passing nod to another kagekidan, the 'Takarazuka Revue
Company.'  The Takarazuka Kagekidan, like the Teikoku, was established in the
Taisho era and also bears the unique distinction of featuring an all-female
cast, playing both female and male roles, who perform musicals from a variety of
genres.  The Takarazuka is divided into several groups, including the "Flower"
(hana-gumi), "Snow" (yuki-gumi), "Moon" (tsuki-gumi), and "Star" (hoshi-gumi),
some of which also appear in the Teikoku Kagekidan.  The similarities are well
apparent.  And the Takarazuka, which enjoys considerable popularity, still
exists today.  For further information, try the official Takarazuka site at
<http://www.hankyu.co.jp/kageki/>.

{19} Another pun.  'Butai,' written 「部隊」, means 'squad' or 'corps'; written
「舞台」, it means 'stage.'

{20} "GA-GAAAAAN!" is more onomatopoeia, this one expressing Ohgami's shock.

{21} 'Kyuutei' (宮廷) means 'the Court,' i.e. where the Emperor or King resides. 
'Kyuutei-geki' or 'Court plays' would thus be those plays performed in the
Court.  'Conte' (from the French word) plays are short tales of adventure,
according to the Merriam-Webster dictionary, although the DaiJirin 2nd Edition
describes the conte as usually being satirical and witty, at least in the
Japanese use of the word.

{22} 'Hana-mi' (花見) or 'flower (especially cherry blossom) viewing' is one of
the most popular springtime events in Japan.  Family and friends get together
and sit under the fully open cherry blossoms and have a sort of picnic
celebration.  You can catch a glimpse of this in the first scene of this chapter
when Ohgami first encounters Sakura.  Popular among the aristocracy since the
Heian Period (794-1185), the tradition of cherry blossom viewing spread
throughout the populace during the Azuchi Momoyama Period (1568-1600) and still
continues today.

{23} The expression referred to here is 'hana yori dango' (「花より団子」),
which essentially encapsulates the idea of choosing the practical over the
aesthetic.  Iris confuses 'dango' ('dumplings') with 'taiko' ('a drum').  In
this case, Iris is literally choosing her "big brother" over the cherry blossom
flowers.

{24} 'Masou Kihei' (「魔操機兵」) literally means 'mechanical soldiers
controlled by evil/magic.'

{25} 'Kuronosukai' (「黒之巣会」) translates to something like 'the Den of
Black.'

{26} 'Psycheons' (or perhaps 'psions,' if you prefer) are described as
fundamental particles, not altogether unlike electrons or protons, of spiritual
energy.  This energy is what powers the psycheon armor (i.e., the Kohbu).  The
word I constructed here is a sort of translation of the original word 'ryoushi'
(「霊子」) into English using Greek word roots that correspond to the characters
used ('spirit or soul' (「霊」) and 'child' (「子」), or in this case, a suffix
for fundamental particles; c.f. 'denshi' (「電子」) = 'electron,' 'youshi'
(「陽子」) = 'proton').

{27} 'Kiai' (「気合」) more or less means 'fighting spirit.'  Perhaps 'guts'
might be another possible translation.  'Hissatsu kougeki' (「必殺攻撃」),
literally 'certain-kill attack,' is a term commonly used to mean 'special
attack.'

{28} 'Wakiji' (「脇侍」) literally means 'support/flank warrior.'

{29} 'Shouri no poozu…… kime!'  The phrase 'victory pose' actually appears
completely before the ellipsis, after which the word 'kime,' which is a form of
the verb 'kimeru' is said.  'Kimeru' means 'to decide' or 'to choose.'  In
essence, the Flower-Troupe is saying that they're 'deciding on' their victory
pose.  Once again, this doesn't translate well into English, so I've taken the
liberty of omitting the 'kime' and moving the 'pose' after the ellipsis.

{30} 'Amazake,' which literally means 'sweet sake,' is described as "a cultured
sweet thick creamy glutinous rice product with virtually no alcohol content"
(http://www.chariot.net.au/~dna/koji.html#Amasake).

{31} This is the catchphrase of Sakura Wars ('Taishou-zakura ni rouman no
arashi!!' 「太正桜に浪漫の嵐！！」).  'Taisho' is the era in which Sakura Wars
takes place (1912-25).
