To think, the year's almost over. 
You're right. It's already December and the weather's gotten really frigid. 
I'm already not an early bird, so this season's always hard for me. 
Lower temperatures tend to slow down the body's ability to move as well. 
But if it snows, we can build snowmen or have a snowball fight. 
It'll be loads of fun! 
Everyone here seems to have different opinions on winter, eh? 
What about you, Chief, do you like winter? 
I like winter. 
I don't like winter... 
I like it. The cold never bothered me much. 
Huh... What's so great about winter? 
Well... 
Winter games. 
Hot pots. 
Kotatsu and oranges? 
There's all kinds of games you can play in the winter. 
Yeah! Snowball fights are the best! 
Sports such as skiing and skating can only be enjoyed in winter as well. 
Uh-huh... Is that all? 
Hot pots are great. Just having everyone gather around the fire is fun. 
Hot pot? 
We gather around a boiling pot of broth and cook all sorts of food by dipping them in it. 
Yeah! It tastes really good and warms your body up! 
And above all else, it's fun gathering around and eating with everyone else. 
Ooh, is that so? 
I kind of like to just laze around under a kotatsu and eat some oranges. 
Ehehe. Oh, Ogami! It is true though. 
Kotatsu? What's that? 
A kotatsu is... Well, uh... It's covered with a heavy blanket, and... 
Um... It's kind of hard to explain. 
A kotatsu is a Japanese heating device. 
It's a table covered with a blanket. You burn charcoal briquettes in a pit underneath it to warm your body. 
Well, when we put the kotatsu out, you'll understand once you try it. 
Uh... Now that I think of it, I don't really know what's so great about winter. 
At least it's better than summer, I guess? 
What a boring answer. 
I feel like an idiot for asking that. 
I don't like winter. It's cold, so... 
Tee-hee! You can't stand the cold! 
But on the bright side, winter makes all kinds of food taste more delicious. 
Yeah! Hot pot with everyone gathered around is the best! 
Ah, winter. Huh... I can't say whether I like it or not. 
Traveling all over the world on that training voyage... 
It made me realize that Japan's four seasons are all beautiful. It's hard to choose a favorite myself. 
Right. I also like each of Japan's four seasons. 
To me, winter is my favorite. It's the season where I can enjoy all kinds of kimonos. 
Heh, just like how a bagworm wraps themselves up in the winter. 
You're one to talk, gobbling up all those extra meals lately. Are you getting ready to hibernate or something? 
Now you've done it, Sumire. After so long, you picking fights with me again? 
Oh goodness, you two never change. 
We're going to be rehearsing for our Christmas performance. Behave yourselves. 
Christmas performance? 
Yes. It's called "The Miracle Bells." 
It's a special one night only performance on Christmas Eve. 
It's about the miracle that happened on Christmas and the main lead will play the Holy Mother. 
I can't wait. 
Who's the main lead? 
A special performance only for one night, huh? I can't wait. 
This will be the Flower Division's last performance for this year. 
Everyone is excited to give a spectacular performance, so look forward to it. 
By the way, who's going to be the lead for this play? 
Well, you see... 
Hm? 
We already have candidates for the role... 
But we still haven't made the final decision on who gets to play the Holy Mother. 
Oh... 
Mon Frère, we'll do our best... 
So do your best for the play, too. Ok? 
Me? 
I-Iris! 
Oh... 
You meant to wish him luck at his job as ticket puncher for the play, right, Iris? 
Y-Yeah! Good luck, Mon Frère! 
All right, everyone. It's time to begin our rehearsal. 
OK! Bring it on! 
Well, Captain, we must be off. 
Feel free to take a look later, Ogami. 
Christmas performance, huh? I wonder what kind of play it'll end up being. 
Ogami. 
Need something, Kaede? 
There's something I want to talk to you about. 
Can you come to my room in about 30 minutes? 
30 minutes, that'll be 4:45 PM, then. 
Yes. I'll be waiting for you. 
I wonder what Kaede wants to talk about. 
For now, I'll just walk around the theater to kill some time. 
Sorry, Ogami, but each customer is only allowed to purchase one photo at a time. 
I see. That's too bad. 
Sorry, Ogami, but each customer is only allowed to purchase one photo at a time. 
Oh, really? That's too bad.
