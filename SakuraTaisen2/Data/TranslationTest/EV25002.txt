Destroying everything the people hold dear... It's wrong. 
We will protect everyone's futures... That is our justice! 
You understand nothing! 
Even if you defeat me here, it changes nothing! 
This city must be destroyed once and for all. It must be purged. 
There will come a day when someone will carry on my ideals. 
And for their sake... I will drag you all to hell with me! 
Kyogoku... This ends now!
