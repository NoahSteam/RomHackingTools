Om maitrashti svaha... <br> Om maitrashti svaha... <br> Om maitrashti svaha... 
Kouma... Burn the capital to ash. 
True purification begins with destruction. 
Every man-made thing that makes Tokyo fake shall be destroyed... 
...by Musashi. 
Om maitrashti svaha. <br> Om maitrashti svaha. <br> Om maitrashti svaha. 
Oh, Musashi, the seal of old Tokyo has been released. 
You may have this vengeful power that has just been set free. 
Destroy everything. 
And so forth, the true Tokyo will be born! 
To think that Kyogoku was actually alive... 
When the coup de'tat failed, the body they found must have been his double. 
Damn him. He used the coup as cover while he went underground... 
And used that as a chance to revive Musashi. 
Kouma are coming out in droves... 
And those creeps from the Black Demon Society are still alive, too! 
On top of that, to think that Demon King is actually Sakura's father... 
... 
... 
Now's not the time to panic. In a situation like this, we need to stay calm. 
Understand the situation and analyze it calmly. There we'll find a way. 
True. For now, organizing all available information should come first. 
Hm. Ogami, is there anything you'd like to ask? 
Ask about the Octagram. 
Ask about Musashi. 
Ask about the Kouma. 
I'd like to ask about the "Octagram of Demonic Calling" they mentioned earlier 
This is all just conjecture, but here's my theory. 
This is a recent map of Tokyo. 
And here are the locations of our battles with the Black Demon Society. 
T-This is... All of these locations form an octagon! 
Furthermore, there's another one thing in common with these places. 
The torii gates. 
Torii gates... 
Yes. Those gates were always present whenever we got into a battle with them. 
Torii gates? Uh... Were they always there? 
Well... I remember now. There was a torii when we fought them at the restaurant in Fukagawa! 
Ikebukuro, Asakusa... There were torii gates there as well. 
It's possible that they're the keys to casting the Octagram. 
I believe that the Octagram of Demonic Calling is a spell to release spirit energy into Tokyo. 
Looks like the Black Demon Society attacked Tokyo in order to reveal those gates... 
And to prepare the ritual. 
Damn! If only we realized it sooner! 
About the huge thing that Kyogoku called "Musashi"... 
Hmm... Honestly, I have no clue about that. 
However, as you all probably sensed yourselves, it's a huge mass of evil will. 
It's possibly even worse than the Sacred Demon Castle that surfaced two years ago. 
Yeah. I felt really sick when I saw that thing. 
That said, how do we stop something we know so little about? 
Right. It seems that we have no choice but to apprehend Kyogoku and question him. 
He must know about Musashi's origins... 
Seeing as he can summon an enormous being like that. 
Based on the Moon Division's intel, it seems that Kyogoku is a descendant of a legendary diviner. 
I see. So that's why he can cast a powerful spell like that. 
How were they controlling Kouma? 
Hmm... I had heard rumors. 
During the Kouma War, the Army secretly collected the Kouma we had defeated... 
They were using them for experiments in order to create "artificial Kouma." 
What?! What did they intend to do with them?! 
Kouma enhanced with machinery would make formidable weapons. 
They'd suffer neither fear nor fatigue. Standard weaponry can't touch them, and they could be mass produced. 
B-But... Why would the Army developed such a gruesome project? 
It's Kyogoku's doing. Mechanized Kouma, the Black Demon Society... All of them are part of his scheme. 
Perhaps, Yamazaki's death and the Revolutionary Army's coup... 
All of those things just petty distractions so he could get to work. 
Damn that Kyogoku! 
What are we gonna do now, Mon Frère? 
If this goes on... Are we gonna lose to the bad guys? 
We won't! 
Is there a way? 
If this keeps going... 
No, we won't lose! We're not going to let Tokyo burn to the ground!! 
But... How are we gonna fight those huge enemies? 
Well, you see... 
There must be... some way. It's too soon to give up. 
...Really? Is there really a way to fight them? 
If this keeps going... 
Are we... gonna die? 
... 
Mon Frère... 
Not to worry. We have a trump card for times like this. 
A... trump card? 
You're not saying... 
I am! The final trump card of the Imperial Assault Troupe that lies beneath Tokyo... 
The Aerial Battleship Mikasa!! 
The Mikasa?! Wasn't it wrecked in our previous campaign?! 
Its bow remains in Tokyo Bay as a memorial park, after it pierced the Sacred Demon Castle. 
But, we recovered its hull after that battle. Since then, it had been undergoing secret reparations. 
Hence, we have a "Neo Mikasa"! 
Is that so? 
The Mikasa is currently undergoing final adjustments. 
As soon as they're complete, we'll board the ship and head for Musashi, where Kyogoku is waiting for us! 
Roger! 
Everyone, stand by at the theater until take-off. Now then, dismissed! 
The Aerial Battleship Mikasa, eh? It's waiting for launch right beneath my feet. 
Our battle isn't over, Kyogoku. 
...Ogami. 
Sakura... Something wrong? 
There's... something I want to talk to you about... 
About your father? 
About the battle? 
About me? 
About your father? 
Yes... 
About the battle? 
Yes... About that, and also... 
About my father... 
I see. It's about how Demon King might be your father, isn't it? 
...Yes. 
Is it... about me? 
No... 
It's about my father... 
Oh, I see. It's about how Demon King might be your father, isn't it? 
...Yes. 
Something you want to talk about? What is it? 
It's about my father... 
Oh, I see. It's about how Demon King might be your father, isn't it? 
...Yes. 
Uhm... In here, it's kind of... You know. How about we go outside? 
Got it. Let's go outside, then. 
Sakura, you were saying that Demon King is Colonel Shinguji, your father. 
Yes. That unique stance... He must be my father. 
Ogami, what should I do about this? 
Let's bring him back! 
Isn't he dead? 
Sakura, let's bring Colonel Shinguji's soul back to our side! 
Huh?! 
Kyogoku used a revival technique to revive him, just like with Major Yamazaki... 
And now Kyogoku is controlling him as the Demon King. 
If we break Kyogoku's spell. I'm sure we can turn him back to normal. 
Ogami, that's... 
Yes! We just need to defeat Kyogoku with all our might! 
...Y-Yes. 
... 
Ogami, would you hear out my decision? 
But... isn't your father dead? 
I'm sure that Kyogoku used a some sort of revival spell to bring him back to life, just like Major Yamazaki. 
And now Kyogoku's controlling him. 
I see... 
... 
Ogami, would you hear out my decision? 
Hmm... What should you do about that, huh? 
I'm sorry... Asking you such a difficult question like that out of the blue. 
... 
I'm sure that my father is under Kyogoku's control. 
If we can break his spell, we can turn my father back to normal. 
I see... 
... 
Ogami, would you hear out my decision? 
I've made up my mind... to fight my father. 
Huh?! Sakura, why?! 
If his soul could've overcome Kyogoku, he would've freed himself long ago. 
But, even now, he continues to stand against us as the Demon King. 
What's more, every time we try to fight Kyogoku, he continually gets in the way. 
... 
That's why I'm going to cross swords with Father... To talk to him through the blade. 
That will surely liberate my Father's soul from Kyogoku's spell. 
Sakura... 
Thank you so much, Ogami. Talking with you feels like it's given me some extra resolve. 
It's about time for the Mikasa to take off. Let's head inside. 
Yes. 
Skreeee! 
...?! 
That noise... Don't tell me... 
K-Kouma?! 
Damn it. They've finally launched their assault, huh?! 
Skreeee! 
Ogami, what should we do?! 
We'll fight! 
We'll retreat! 
Call for help! 
We'll fight them off, Sakura! We have to hold the Kouma off until the Mikasa can launch! 
But we won't last very long fighting them with just the two of us! 
Urgh... What are we gonna do? 
Let's run, Sakura! The two of us wouldn't last that long against that many of them. 
B-But if we run, they'll get inside the theater! 
We have to protect this place until the Mikasa can lift off! 
Urgh... What are we gonna do? 
I'll stop these Kouma. Sakura, call everyone to get down here! 
No way! Fighting them all by yourself is too dangerous! 
They'll get inside if I don't keep them back. 
Even so, I won't abandon you! 
Urgh... What are we gonna do? 
O-Ogami!! 
Skreeee! 
Urgh... What are we gonna do? 
Sorry to keep you waiting, Ogami! 
T-That voice... 
Ka... Kayama?! 
You can leave this to me and the boys of the Moon Division. Just get to the command room, Ogami. Hurry! 
B-But... 
Ogami, do you know what makes me happiest? 
A peaceful Tokyo. 
One where I'm able to protect the smiles in town. <br> Now go, Ogami. 
Kayama... 
Don't worry about me. We'll hold them off until the Mikasa can launch. 
We're counting on you, Kayama! 
Watch yourself! 
Kayama... We're counting on you! 
Got it, Ogami. Just make sure you beat Musashi! 
Roger! 
Come at me, Kouma! In the name of the Imperial Assault Troupe's Moon Division, I will not let you come one step further! 
Kayama... 
Watch yourself, Kayama! No matter how strong you are, fighting the Kouma all by yourself would be... 
No need to worry, Ogami. I may not be piloting a spirit armor, but the Moon Division has ample battle experience. 
We may have fallen one step behind the enemy's plan... 
But I'll do my best to hold them here! 
Kayama... 
Kayama... 
Ogami... 
There's a saying I know, "prompt action brings success." 
Tokyo doesn't have much time left. You need to launch the Mikasa as soon as possible!! 
Run, Ogami! Run towards our victory!! 
Yeah. We'll meet again, Kayama! 
Let's go, Sakura! 
Roger! 
Commander Yoneda! Is the Mikasa go for launch?! 
... 
Final inspections for Mikasa are complete! All reports show we are clear for take-off! 
Evacuation of citizens on the launch ramp, complete! 
Commander Yoneda. Your next orders, please. 
...Commander Yoneda. 
...Mhmm. 
The future of Tokyo is in this Aerial Battleship Mikasa... 
And with it, the Imperial Assault Troupe. 
Starting now, we're to carry out the greatest mission on earth. 
Aerial Battleship Mikasa, take off!! 
300 seconds after launch, speed has leveled out! 
Our six main engines read all clear! 
All turret safety systems turned off. Switching to primary combat configuration. 
We did it! The Mikasa is finally flying! 
Let's not celebrate just yet, Ogami. We haven't even reached the target yet. 
The real battle starts right now. 
Roger! 
Commander Yoneda, your orders. 
Mhmm. 
Proceed to secondary combat positions. 
Proceeding to secondary combat positions. 
All main engines, increase output by 20%. 
All main engines, increasing output by 20%. 
Increase speed by 100 knots. 
Increasing speed by 100 knots. 
Kyougoku... We're not going to let you have Tokyo. 
Final destination is... Musashi! 
Final destination is... Musashi! 
The Imperial Navy, if we were to face off against the Kouma, would be but a candle in the wind against their might. 
At this rate, Tokyo's destruction will only be a matter of time. 
We have just one last ace in the hole. 
No one can stop Kyogoku's ambitions other than them. 
The Aerial Battleship Mikasa... And the Imperial Assault Troupe. 
Tokyo's future. We leave it up to you... 
OK. Mikasa has safely gotten into the air. 
Now, I'd like to discuss our plan of action. 
Oh yeah, time to have a duel with Musashi! 
Ogami, if it were up to you, how would you go about it? 
Bombardment from the Mikasa 
Attack its weak point 
Infiltrate it 
If it were up to me, I would conduct a bombardment using the Mikasa. 
Oh, nice. We'd be able to tout our big guns to see who's the strongest. 
Would the Mikasa's main cannon even be enough to take Musashi down? 
Uh... That's... 
If it were up to me, I'd attack its weak point for massive amounts of damage. 
I see... That does sound like a good strategy. 
If only we knew where it was most vulnerable. 
Oh... Yeah. You're right about that. 
I would infiltrate Musashi and destroy it from the inside. 
Heh. So you're thinking about that too. 
...It's a dangerous strategy. 
But in order to defeat Musashi, there's no other way. 
Uh... To be honest, I haven't thought about it. 
Come on, Ogami. Get a grip. 
Just when we set the Mikasa to fly you have no strategy? You're better than that. 
You're from the navy, you should already have some ideas about how to deploy this battleship. 
R-Right. 
Now, let me explain the plan. Focus your attention towards the screen. 
After this briefing, the Mikasa will start to ascend. 
Eventually we'll reach the same altitude as Musashi, perfectly lined up to it. 
Then, we'll accelerate towards it at maximum power. 
When we reach maximum, we'll attack Musashi's face with our main cannon and force our way inside. 
Hey, hey, you're not saying we're gonna jam the whole ship into that thing, are you? 
Well, to put it simply, that's exactly what I'm saying. 
This is our only way to confront Musashi. 
Of course though, Kyogoku must have predicted that we'd be coming with the Mikasa. 
Whoops, seems we have some uninvited guests coming aboard. 
Kouma descending from high altitude! They're attacking the Mikasa's deck! 
Red alert! Kouma have infiltrated the engine room on both sides! 
If the engines get destroyed, the Mikasa will stall and be unable to maintain altitude! 
Tch... So they're also thinking of destroying us from the inside, huh? 
Ogami, time to move out! Divide the Flower Division into two groups of four and drive off the invaders in the engine room! 
Understood! 
Ogami, let me join you. Please! 
OK, join me! 
Take care of the other squad. 
OK, join me! I'm sure your power will be vital to our defense! 
Yes! I'll give it my all! 
Take care of the other squad. I need you to protect the other engine room. 
...Understood. I'll work with the second team. 
Please do your best leading your squad, Ogami. 
You're not going to leave me behind, are you, Ensign? 
Of course not! 
I leave the other team to you! 
Of course not! Let's go together, Sumire! 
Ohohohoho! Why of course! 
I'm leaving the other team in your hands! You have the power to protect that other engine room. 
For some reason I feel as if you're just saying that. 
But never mind. I will work with the other team. 
Captain, please let me join your team. 
I'm counting on you. 
Lead the other force. 
Yeah, I'm counting on you. Having you by my side will be reassuring. 
Understood. We will protect the Mikasa until the end. 
I need you to take care of the other team, Maria. Having you lead it would be a major boon. 
...Understood. I'll take care of the other detachment. 
Captain... Please take care. 
You're gonna bring me onto your outfit, right, Boss? 
Let's go together! 
Take care of the other team. 
Yeah, let's go together! In times like this, you'll be a great help. 
Now that's what I'm talking! I'll show the power of Kanna Kirishima! 
I need you to take care of the other unit, Kanna. Let's divide up our strength to drive off all our enemies. 
...OK. I'll do as you say, Boss. 
Leave the other team to me! 
Let me join you, Mon Frère! 
OK, got it. 
Iris, please be patient. 
OK, got it. Let's go together, Iris. 
Yay! I'm gonna work extra hard for you! 
Iris, please be patient. I need you to go with the second team. 
Whaaaat? So I can't go with you?! 
...Sorry, Iris. But I hope you understand. 
Hm... OK. 
You can take me anytime, Chief! 
Come with me! 
Take care of the second team. 
OK, Kohran. Come with me! 
You can count on me! The Mikasa is the crown jewel of this theater's technology. I absolutely won't let it crash! 
I need you to take care of the second team, Kohran. Please protect the other engine room. 
'Kay. Got it. 
I wanted to go with you, but... I'll give my all in the other detachment. 
Basic battles like this aren't my cup of tea, so what should I do? 
Wanna go together? 
Take care of the other team. 
If you'd like... would you like to go with me? 
I suppose I don't have any other options. If it's with Ensign though, sure thing. 
I need you to take care of the other team, Orihime. 
You're not choosing me, Ensign? What are you saying? 
I'll still help the others, but this does not sit well with me! 
...Captain. Your orders, please. 
Join my force. 
Take care of the second team. 
You're gonna join my team, Reni! 
...Understood. 
I need you to take care of the second unit, Reni. 
...Understood. 
Great, you're all set. 
Sakura... 
Sumire... 
Maria... 
Kanna... 
Iris... 
Kohran... 
Orihime... 
Reni... 
You four, mobilize with Ogami. The other four will deploy as a separate team. 
Time to move out! Don't let the Mikasa get beaten by the likes of these Kouma! 
Roger! 
Sorry, Ogami, but each customer is only allowed to purchase one photo at a time. 
I see. That's too bad. 
My apologies, Ogami, but each customer is only allowed to purchase one photo at a time. 
Oh, really? That's too bad.
