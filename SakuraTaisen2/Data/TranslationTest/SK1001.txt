Year 15 of the Taisho Era, the first evening of the new year. 
Happy New year! 
Happy New Year. I hope we can get along this year as well. 
Let's do our best this year too, guys. 
Yes! We'll be in your care for this year too. 
Let's get along this year too, Reni! 
Likewise. 
Oh Reni, you haven't changed since last year! 
Come on, it's fine! A gentle girl is way better than a noisy one! 
Hearing it from you doesn't seem to convincing at all, Kanna. 
Come on, you two. Are you starting a fight as the new year just begun? 
Ahahaha... Everyone's still the same. 
Let's have a rice cake pounding contest with my invention, "Mr. Pounder"! 
And you're just like usual, Kohran. Don't blow things up again right in the new year! 
Oh, you want to get pounded in rice cake's stead, huh? 
Eeehh?! I'm kidding, I'm kidding!! 
Hahahaha...
