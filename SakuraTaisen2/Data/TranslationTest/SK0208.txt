You did a great job, Iris. 
Yeah! Because I got Mon Frère with me! 
And we got Reni as our new friend! I'm not lonely anymore! 
Well, in regards to Reni, that's good. However, I still don't think Japanese men are all that special. 
Hahaha. Harsh as usual, Orihime. 
Reni, our next battles may get harder, but let's keep doing our best, together. 
...I don't mind. I came here to fight, after all. 
With battles of this caliber, we can't afford to be anything less than perfect. 
Huh? Looks like there's someone contacting us. 
I'll check it now. 
Hehe! Mon Frère! 
What is it, Iris? 
Don't forget your pro-mise with me! 
Promise...? 
Oh, Mon Frère! You promised to play with me, remember? 
O-Oh. Right. 
OK! Once we got home, first we'll have a date! Tee-hee, it's a deal! 
Together we'll go shopping, have lunch and then, and then... 
We'll aaaalways be together, no matter what! 
Er, boy... I made quite the promise, didn't I? 
O-Ogami, everyone! We got a situation!! 
What's wrong, Sakura!? Is something wrong!? 
I just got a transmission from Saki. 
Commander Yoneda, someone just shot him! 
Wh... What did you say?!
