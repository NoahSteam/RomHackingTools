By the way, has everyone made a resolution for this year? 
Mine's of course to get stronger and stronger! 
Mine is to be more grown-up! 
Is that even a resolution? 
Tell us your resolution, Ogami. 
My resolution is... 
Strive for peace. 
Getting along with members. 
Having a fun life. 
My resolution for this year is to ensure peace for this city. 
Oho, just as to be expected from the Flower Division's captain. 
My resolution for this year is to get along with the all our members. 
Haha, that's just the answer I'd expect from you. 
My resolution for this year is to have a life well lived. 
My... What a resolution that is. 
It does seem fun to have a life like that. You certainly 
But as the captain, why don't you think of a more positive resolution? 
R-Right... 
...I haven't give much thougt on it. 
Oh, is that so? 
Since it's the beginning of a new year, you should think about some goals that you want to achieve. 
Hmm... OK, I'll give it some thought. 
You seem to have one, Sakura. Tell us. 
My resolution this year is to polish my swordmanship. 
I'm trying to learn my father's stance so I can get as skilled as he was. 
To do that this year, I intend to practice a lot. Starting from the basics and other techniques. 
I get it... That's a nice resolution. 
For that reason, I want to return home to Sendai for a bit. 
I see... What about the others? Do you have plans for New Year? 
I plan to return to the Kanzaki mansion as well. 
I wanna go back to Okinawa to visit my dad's grave. 
Is that so... How about you, Maria? 
I'm planning to visit Count Hanakoji's residence for New Year's. I owe him a lot. 
I'm planning to go to Kobe. I'm visiting my old foster father. 
I see... 
Mon Frère, Mon Frère, you gotta hear this! 
My papa and mama are coming all the way from France to see me! 
Is that so? That's great. 
Yeah! I'll be with my papa and mama for a while! 
My mamma will also visit Japan to see my father. 
Really? Reuniting after all this time, isn't that great? 
Yes! Fantastico! 
By the way, what's you plan, Ogami? 
I'll be staying here. 
I want to go out. 
Lazing in bed. 
I'll be staying here. 
Even though we took down the Black Demon Society, leaving the theater alone worries me. 
Haha, aren't you being ever so diligent? 
Let's see... I also want to go somewhere. 
Ah, you're free to leave if you'd like. 
This is one of the few days we can have off during the year, so no need to worry about anything else. 
I'll just lazing around in bed for New Year's. 
Oh, you're going to loung around. Well, I suppose that's not a bad choice. 
I haven't decided yet. 
Aha, I see that you haven't worried too much about anything. That's very like you. 
Now, everyone. I hope you'll get to relax for the New Year. 
For those returning home, take care during your travels. 
Right, understood. 
Sorry, Ogami, but each customer is only allowed to purchase one photo at a time. 
I see. That's too bad.
