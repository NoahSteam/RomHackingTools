Why? Why won't you... fight me? I'm... your enemy! 
Reni, do not be deceived! You are a killing machine. Everyone else is your enemy! 
That's not true! Reni, you have to believe in others! 
Mon Frère, take this! 
What... is that?! 
Reni, you have to remember! Remember who you are! Remember who WE are! 
The time we first met... The days we spent together... Have you completely forgotten? 
Remember how Iris poured her heart into making this flower crown for you! 
Urgh... 
I didn't know how lost you felt, how anxious you felt, how lonely you felt... 
What am I fighting for?" When you asked me that question, I didn't know how to tell you. 
But now... Now I can tell you exactly how I feel! 
We fight for those dear to us! We fight to protect the ones we love! 
The ones... we love? 
Uh... Urgh... 
Your words are meaningless! Reni, kill them this instant! 
Come back to us, Reni! To your friends! 
To the Flower Division! 
You're not a machine. You can fight for what you believe in! 
To protect what you hold dear! 
C-Captain... 
Reni! Kill them!! That's an order! 
Reni!! 
Captain... I... I... 
You don't have to say anything. 
Welcome back, Reni. 
... 
I'm back, Captain... I'm back, Iris... I'm back, everyone... 
I'm back... my friends... 
Thank you... 
Heehee! Welcome back, Reni! 
Tsch! You were nothing but a useless piece of junk after all. 
Very well. I'll kill you all myself! Come at me! 
I won't falter anymore. Thanks to the others, I finally know what I'm fighting for! 
I fight for myself... And I fight for everyone! 
All right, let's go, everyone! 
Sir, yes, sir!
