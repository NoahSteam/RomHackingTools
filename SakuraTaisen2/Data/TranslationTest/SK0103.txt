It's 9 o'clock already, huh? 
It's my first night back in this theater, then. 
Even so, so much has happened today, hasn't it? 
W-What's that sound?! 
The sounds are coming from this machine. What is it? 
Whoa! Something appeared on the screen! 
A-hoy, Chief! Ya hear me? Kohran here! 
Man, it's really you, Chief. 
Haven't seen you for so long. 
Kohran... It has been a long time. Glad to see that you're doing good. 
Is that you, Kohran?ã€€Thanks for coming after me earlier. 
Hehe, it's not a big deal, Chief. 
By the way, what's this machine? 
Hehe, surprised, aren't ya?ã€€This is my invention, the "Cinematron"! 
So this is the present you were talking about, right? 
Yup! Glad you like it. 
This is a steam-powered communication tool called the Cinematron. 
I'll teach you how to use it. 
First, tune the "Call Number" of the person you want to reach with the "Main Dial" in the middle. 
Next, press the "Call" button on the upper right. 
If you want to end your call, press the "Power" button. 
The ones right here are "Speed Dials." You can quickly connect to a person you've reached before with these buttons. 
There may be some times where the person can't respond to your call, though. Easy, right? 
Uhm... I get it, kind of. 
Okie-dokie! Now let's get to practicing. Practice makes perfect! 
How about you try to reach me over at Hanayashiki, Chief? 
Our Call Number is "13700." 
I'll wait for yer call. You can do it, Chief. 
OK, time to test it. Tune the dial first, then press the "Call" button. 
13700, right?ã€€OK, I'll try. 
Oops, I should press this button later when I'm gonna end the call. 
I can't reach her. Did I dial the wrong number? 
Hanayashiki's number was 13700, right? Let's try again. 
Hello? This is Hanayashiki. 
Oh, Chief! You managed to call me by yourself! 
Well, I managed somehow. 
OK, let's move to the big screen so we can talk. 
Can ya hear me, Chief? 
Yeah, I can hear you. I can see your face, too. 
Great, I can hear you loud and clear, too. 
This is amazing. You can chat with another person from far away while seeing their face at the same time. 
Heh, it was no big deal. Making this baby was a piece of cake. 
Anyways, Chief, I thought I should let you know... 
I still have work to do over here, so I won't be back 'til summer. 
In the meantime, call me with your Cinematron, 'kay? 
Of course I'll call. 
What a pain... 
Of course, no problem. I'll call you again, 13700. 
Thanks, Chief. I'm... looking forward to it. 
Ugh, operating this thing is so complicated. This'll be a pain in the neck to learn. 
You won't learn anything with that attitude, Chief. 
Beside, isn't it rude to say something's "a pain" when people ask you for something? 
Uh, well... You have a point. 
Oh well, you can just gimme a call whenever you feel like it. 
OK, Kohran, got it. 
Earth to Chief, can ya hear me? 
Ah, s-sorry. I spaced out for a moment... 
Thanks for giving me this amazing tool, Kohran. 
Aw come on, that's too much. It's not a big deal if it's for you. 
Heeeey, Boss! Can you hear me? It's Kanna Kirishima. 
Kanna? Is that you, Kanna? 
Hehe, you bet. Long time no see, Boss. 
I feel like we just saw each other earlier. 
Man, it's really been a long time. 
I wanted to see you in person when you arrived, but sadly I had already left the capital. Sorry. 
Don't worry about it. Seeing you looking well is good enough for me. 
I see you have a Cinematron with you as well. 
Yeah, Kohran gave me one before I left for Okinawa. 
Hehe! Sorry to interrupt, but this is the power of my Cinematron for ya! 
You can talk to a bunch of people at the same time with this machine. 
I also gave the others one before they left, too. 
Huh? So, that means... 
Ohohohoho! You haven't forgotten about me, have you, Ensign? 
It is I, the Top Star of the Imperial Theater, Sumire Kanzaki. 
Thank you for sending me off earlier, Ensign. 
It is I, the Top Star of the Imperial Theater, Sumire Kanzaki. 
Pardon me for not contacting you earlier, Ensign. 
Sumire. 
How does is it feel to return to the theater after so long? 
I assume you would be twice as happy if I were there with you when you returned. 
Hey, hey, don't just assume things like that. 
My, your indecent manner of speaking hasn't changed at all, Kanna. 
Oh yeah, cactus woman? Well, you're always so full of yourself! 
That's enough, both of you! 
Can you hear my voice, Captain? It's me, Maria Tachibana. 
Maria! Of course I can hear you. 
Captain, thank you for seeing me off earlier. 
It's been a long time Captain. Seeing you lively as ever relieves me. 
Great to see you doing well too, Maria. 
I'm contacting you from a ship heading to New York. 
Amazing, isn't it? 
Even when I'm atop the waves, I can talk with you like this. 
It really is amazing. All thanks to Kohran's Cinematron. 
And because it was one of her inventions, we need to watch out in case they blow up in our faces. 
Aw man, that's a low blow, Sumire. 
Ahahahaha... 
Anyways, Boss, I'm still training and won't be able to return for a while. 
Hit me up sometime, OK? 
OK. Good luck, Kanna. 
Thanks, Boss! See you later. 
Ensign, get this. I rushed home after I heard that my grandfather Tadayoshi got ill and collapsed. 
Turns out he's perfectly healthy and energetic! It was just a ruse to trick me into returning home! 
I-I see... 
Well, I could just sneak out I suppose. 
I hope we can meet at the theater soon. Now then, excuse me. 
Things must be very hectic for you, Captain. And just when you returned. 
Please, take care of everyone in the Flower Division. 
Of course, leave it to me. 
Thank you very much, Captain. I'll be going now. 
Me too, Chief, I have to go as well. 
Thanks, Kohran. I'll make good use of this Cinematron. 
Glad to hear that! 
Later, Chief. 
This thing sure comes handy. 
Even though Kohran's the one who made it, it doesn't look very dangerous. 
...Ensign. 
Wah! You surprised me, Sumire! Is there something else you needed? 
I forgot to tell you something important. 
I never gave you my Call Number. 
My Call Number is "13800." May I ask you to give me a call? 
It's 13800, right? OK, I'll set it to my Speed Dial. 
Please reach me out when you have a moment, Ensign. I'll wait for your call. 
...Captain. 
Wah! You surprised me, Maria! Is there something else you needed? 
Sorry to bother you again, but I forgot to tell you something important. 
I want to give you my Call Number. 
My Call Number is "13900." Please let me know if anything happens. 
It's 13900, right? OK, I'll set it to my Speed Dial. 
I'm going to go now. Good night, Captain. 
...Boss! 
Wah! You surprised me, Kanna! Is there something else you needed? 
Oh, my bad, sorry. I forgot to tell you something important. 
I was gonna give you my Call Number. 
Let's see, my number is... Aha, there it is, "14000"! 
It's 14000, right? OK, I'll set it to my Speed Dial. 
Bye, Boss! Sleep well tonight! 
OK, it's getting pretty late already, so I should just end the call. 
Now, what should I do next? 
...Hm? At this hour? Who could that be? 
Yes? I'm coming! 
Good evening, Ogami. 
Good evening, Sakura. What is it? 
The manager was wondering if you could do the night watch. 
Night watch will only be until 10 o'clock. You can inspect the theater in 30 minutes. 
Night patrol, huh... 
I'll join you, Ogami. Let's go together. 
I know! Let's ask Orihime to come along too. This will be a great chance to talk with her. 
OK, let's go. 
...Orihime? 
I just want to go to sleep... 
OK, let's go. It'll be my first job as the captain, so I should do my best. 
I'm concerned about Orihime, too. 
I'm relieved that you accepted like that. Thank you so much! 
Let's head to Orihime's room, then. 
Talk with her? Wouldn't that just create more trouble between us? 
Ogami, solving problems among your peers is one of your duties as captain! 
Now let's head to her room. Follow me. 
I-I get it. We're going, we're going. 
Actually, I just want to head to bed. A Lot of things have happened today, and I'm exhausted. 
I see, and here I am certain you would have accepted. 
Sorry for disturbing you. Well, good night. 
... 
Guess I might have overdone it. 
Oh well, can't help it. I'll just hit the hay, then. 
Ogami, if you keep hesitating it'll be midnight. 
Let's just talk to her before she goes to sleep. 
Hmmm... What should we do? 
All right, I'm just gonna drag you over there by force. 
H-Hey, Sakura! Don't pull my sleeve! W-Wait! 
So, this is Orihime's room. I wonder if she's still awake. 
Ogami! Where do you think you're going? You need to talk to her! 
The name plate has a simple design, but it sure looks classy. 
Yeees? Who is it? 
It's Ogami. Could I talk to you for a moment? 
Ensign? It's late. What do you need, is it urgent? 
Orihime, it's Sakura. Sorry for disturbing you so late at night. 
Um, there's something we wanted to talk with you about. 
... 
I don't know what you want, but I'm about to go to sleep. Make it snappy, OK? 
If it takes too long, I might just leave in the middle of it. 
(Looks like she's not in a great mood. Let's try to invite her along on our night watch.) 
(I need to be careful with this, or else she might leave in the middle of our chat. All right. let's do this.) 
Where do you think you're looking at?! You just called me out here; your rudeness knows no bounds! 
Uh... N-No. You're mistaken. 
Ogami, just where did you look at? We need to invite her for the night patrol. 
Y-Yeah, you're right. 
... 
(Orihime... She's glaring at me.) 
Avert her eyes. 
O-Orihime... Don't stare at me like that, please. 
Hehe. So you're averting my gaze, just as I expected. 
Avoiding eye contact shows a lack of self-confidence. 
Is that all you got, Ensign? 
Urk... 
... 
Hehe, so you're not averting my gaze, huh. 
Avoiding eye contact shows a lack of self-confidence. 
Not that I'm implying that you do have it. 
Well? What do you want to talk about? 
Wow, Orihime, I didn't think Italians like you could have such pretty black hair. 
...That's none of your business! Back off! 
Yikes! D-Did I say something to make her mad? 
(She'll just get angry if I bring up her hair. Let's just leave it.) 
I always wear a negligee to bed. 
Sakura, why don't you try to wear one sometime? 
That'd be sexy! 
I'm sure it would suit her. 
That'd be too adult for her. 
If you wear it, Sakura, I'm sure you'd look sexy in it! 
Ogami, come on... Don't tease me like that. 
If you wear it, Sakura, I'm sure it'd suit you just fine. 
Do you think so? Wouldn't this look a little too mature for me? 
No, of course not. 
Ogami... Thank you. 
If you two want to flirt, do it somewhere else, would you? 
A negligee, huh? I think that'd be too much for Sakura. 
You still think I'm immature, don't you? 
If you two want to squabble, do it somewhere else, would you? 
...I-I think that's a bit too mature for me. 
Oho... Well, perhaps you're right. 
So, what did you want to talk about? I'm sure you didn't come here just to see me in my negligee, right? 
Hey, Ensign! Where were you staring at just now?! 
N-No, that's... I-I didn't do it on purpose. 
So you came here just to ogle other peoples' bodies? Goodness! 
(I'll be in serious trouble if I stare again.) 
These are my favorite earrings. 
I only take them off before going to sleep. 
(Those pretty earrings suit her well.) 
Seriously, what were you going to talk to me about? 
(How should I start?) 
Invite her directly 
Beat around the bush 
I'll get straight to the point. Would you like to come with us on night watch? 
Night watch? What's that? 
How do evenings in Japan feel compared to Italy? Is it warmer here, or colder? 
...Did you call me out here just to talk about that? 
W-Wait, Orihime! Actually, we wanted to invite you along on our night watch. 
Night watch...? 
If you don't have any business with me, I shall be taking my leave. 
W-Wait, Orihime! Actually, we wanted to invite you along on our night watch. 
Night watch...? 
We go around the theater to check anything out of the ordinary. 
Would you like to join us? Because... 
You're bored right now. 
It would be a good change of pace. 
...You're bored right now? 
Just because I'm bored, that doesn't mean I have to join you, though. 
...It'll be a good change of pace. Perfect for killing boredom, right? 
Hm... I wonder about that. 
Um... I think it'll be a good change of pace. 
Change of pace, huh... I wonder about that. 
Well, I do want to take a look at the music room. 
How long will you be doing the night watch? 
Until 10 o'clock. 
Until 11 o'clock. 
Until 12 o'clock. 
Until 10 o'clock. 
10 o'clock, huh... I suppose I could spare the time. 
Until 11 o'clock. 
You got it wrong, Ogami! I told you already, it's until 10 o'clock. 10 o'clock. 
So, how long? Just tell me already! 
Until 12 o'clock. 
You got it wrong, Ogami! I told you already, it's until 10 o'clock. 10 o'clock. 
So, how long? Just tell me already! 
Ogami, did you forget? We're going to do it until 10 o'clock. 
10 o'clock, huh... I suppose I could spare the time. 
But still, why did you want to invite me? 
I wanted to talk with you more. 
I wanted to show you around the theater. 
I wanted to talk with you some more. We haven't had the chance to since this afternoon. 
...What kind of reason is that? 
I have nothing to talk with you about. 
I wanted to show you around the theater. Maybe there will be some other things that'd pique your interest like the tatami mats. 
Good idea. I guess I'll join you, then. 
Reason? Um... How should I put it... 
Is there something you're not telling me? How suspicious. 
Come on, Orihime, let's go. Is there a problem? 
Let me get this straight. I do not want to go with the ensign. 
Don't say that. Let's go. 
I didn't mean to be pushy about it. 
Don't say that, Orihime. Let's go, now. 
You know what, forget it. I'm not going to listen to what some Japanese man tells me to do. 
I shall be taking my leave now. Good luck with your night watch, you two. 
Ugh... That could have gone better. 
That's too bad. And it would have been a good chance to talk with her, too. 
Well, there'll be more chances to talk with her. Let's just continue with the two of us. 
You're right, let's go. 
I didn't mean to be pushy about this. Night watch can be rather difficult, after all. 
...I resent that. 
All right, if you say so. I'll go with you this time. 
Really? Thank goodness! 
Way to go, Ogami. You managed to persuade Orihime even though she was so harsh on you. 
What are you two whispering about? 
N-Nothing! It's nothing! Don't worry about it. 
A-Anyway, let's go out on night patrol! 
Orihime... Why do you hate Japanese men so much? 
That's none of your business! I'm not going to answer that! 
I shall be taking my leave now. Good luck with your night watch, you two. 
Ugh... That could have gone better. 
Did I just... say something that I shouldn't have? 
No, I don't think so. I guess it's just that she can be hard to approach. 
Well, there'll be more chances to talk with her. Let's just continue with the two of us. 
You're right, let's go. 
All right, if you say so. I'll go with you this time. 
But mind you, only for this one time, OK? 
Really? Thank goodness! 
Way to go, Ogami! You even managed to persuade Orihime. 
What are you two whispering about? 
N-Nothing! It's nothing! Don't worry about it. 
A-Anyway, let's go out on night patrol! 
You know what, forget it. Even after all this chatting, I still don't feel like going with you. 
I shall be taking my leave now. Good luck with your night watch, you two. 
Ugh... That's not good. I should have just gotten straight to the point with her. 
That's too bad. And it would have been a good chance to talk with her, too. 
Well, there'll be more chances to talk with her. Let's just continue with the two of us. 
You're right, let's go. 
Ah! Mon Frère, Sakura... 
And Orihime, too... 
Iris... 
What are you doing up at this hour? 
No staying up late. 
Iris, what are you doing up at this hour? 
I wanted to go on night watch, too, so I was looking for you. 
Iris, no staying up late, OK? 
You guys are no fair! You get to go on night watch all by the time! 
I was looking for you. I want to go on night watch, too. 
What are you doing up so late? 
What are you doing up so late? 
I was looking for you. I want to go on night watch, too. 
Is that so? Sorry, Iris, but... 
It's already this late for you. Go back to your room and sleep for today, OK? 
OK, I'll go to sleep, but... 
Oh, I know! I'll go to sleep after you find me in hide-and-seek. 
This time, it's your turn to seek. 
OK, I'm going to hide in costume room. You better come for me! 
Oho, looks like Iris has got you wrapped around her little finger, Ensign. 
Looks like Iris got you, Ogami. 
There's no helping it. I'll just play along with her. 
Now... Where would Iris be hiding? 
There's a shadow right here. Could it be Iris? 
Whaaat? You found me already? 
I really thought there'd be no way I'd get caught. How did know? 
I can see your shadow on the floor. 
You would be more difficult to see if you turned off the light, beforehand. 
Could it be that she's... hiding among the costumes? 
It's quite hard to tell from here, isn't it? 
It's quite hard to tell from here... 
Hmmm... It's hard to figure out since there's so many. 
Don't tell me, she's inside this box... 
O-Ogami, I know that Iris is small, but even she wouldn't be able fit in that box. 
She's not in there, Ogami. 
Let me guess, she's inside... this shoe. 
Ensign, are you out of your mind? 
Seriously, Ogami? 
Ensign, are you looking for a fairy or something? 
I get that she's small, but there's no way she would be able fit inside that shoe. 
The shadow next to the shelf looks suspicious. 
We looked there earlier and didn't find her. 
If she's not here, where could she be hiding? 
Make sure to return used costumes to their original place." 
Everyone makes sure to follow the rules. Thanks to that, this room is always clean and tidy. 
Wash hands before handling costumes." 
Did you wash your hands with soap, Ensign? 
Be careful not to dirty the costumes. 
What a big mirror... I can see my whole body. 
Admiring yourself in the mirror like that, even though you're a man, talk about gross. 
Don't just look at the mirror, Ogami. We need to find Iris. 
Ogami, let's keep looking for Iris like you promised her. 
Time's up, Mon Frère! 
Ah, Ogami! There's a shadow on the floor close to the costumes! 
I see... So that's where she's hiding, behind the costumes. 
Ehehe! Too late now! 
You didn't find me in time, so I win! 
Oh... You got me. 
Ah, this is fun! Playing hide-and-seek at night like this gets me so excited. 
Hehe... Good for you, Iris. 
It's getting late, so please go back to your room now. 
Okaaay! Well, good niiight! 
I see you have a hard time handling kids, too, Ensign 
Well, Iris a member of the Flower Division. 
We've already spent a lot of time here. Let's get back to our night watch. 
That was great, Ogami. Seems that cheered up Iris a lot. 
I didn't expect her to want me to play hide-and-seek with her. 
We've already spent a lot of time here. Let's get back to our night watch. 
Looks like there's nothing out of the ordinary. Let's head to the next room. 
This is the music room, we just added it recently. 
There's a piano. I wonder if we know anyone who can play it. 
Iris is very good with it. I'm still learning how to play it, so I've got a ways to go. 
I believe Orihime can play the piano as well. 
If Orihime is ever with us, maybe she can play a song for us. 
OK, let's move on. We need to check the other rooms. 
This is the music room, we just added it recently. 
Wow, there's a piano right there! 
May I play it for a bit? 
Yes, go ahead. 
Ohoho. Well then, I'm gonna play my heart out! 
... 
(Orihime looks serious...) 
OK... Here I go! 
Wow, amazing! That was really great, Orihime! 
Oho, grazie mille! 
You're very talented, Orihime. Just as I expected. 
Hmmm, so you understand music, huh, Ensign? 
Then that must mean you know what the name of that song I just played was. 
Was it "German March"? 
Was it "Italian March"? 
Was it "Turkish March"? 
I think it's called... "German March"? 
Wrooong! I knew you wouldn't have known. 
I was playing Mozart's "Turkish March." 
O-Oh... Is that so. 
I think it's called... "Italian March"? 
Wrooong! I knew you wouldn't have known. 
I was playing Mozart's "Turkish March." 
O-Oh... Is that so. 
I think it's called... "Turkish March"? 
Oh... I didn't expect that you would know that much about music. 
I don't really remember that song's name, but I think that your piano playing was great. 
Ohoho, I knew you wouldn't know. 
Still, I'm impressed that you didn't pretend to know everything. 
I was playing Mozart's "Turkish March." 
It's common knowledge. Make sure to remember that, Ensign. 
... 
Boy, Orihime, your face was so different when you were playing that song. 
You looked very serious. I can tell that you really like music. 
I-It's not like that! 
Let's just continue your night patrol, Ensign! 
Y-Yeah, right. Let's head to the next room. 
Everything seems to be in order. Let's check the next room. 
This is the costume room. All of our play costumes are stored in here. 
This is where we played hide-and-seek with Iris, isn't it? 
Well, with all these costumes hanging around, there's certainly plenty of places to hide. 
Looks like everything is in order, let's move on. 
This is the costume room. All of our play costumes are stored in here. 
This is where we were playing hide-and-seek with Iris in this room too, isn't it? 
She should've hid in a better spot. 
Seems like there's nothing strange going on in here. Let's check another room. 
This is the dressing room where we held that welcome party. 
You guys organized that party just for us. Thank you. It really made me happy. 
Too bad that Orihime didn't seem to like it very much... 
Yeah, that was too bad. In time though, I think she'll appreciate what we did. 
How about we go on to the next room? There's still plenty of rooms we haven't checked. 
This is the dressing room where we held that welcome party. 
Orihime, can I ask why you were in such a bad mood earlier? 
...I don't want to talk to you about it, Ensign. 
Nothing strange here. Let's head to the next room, shall we? 
There's nothing strange in here, let's head to another room. 
This is the stage wing. This is where the actors wait before going up on stage. 
I wonder why they call it a "wing." 
...Oh well, there's no need to think too much about it. Let's go somewhere else. 
This is the stage wing. This is where the actors wait before going up on stage. 
Wing"? That's a weird way to say it. 
Hahaha, yeah, no idea why it's called that. 
Well, nothing strange here. Let's go on to the next room. 
Doesn't look like anyone is behind the backdrop. Looks like everything is as it should be. 
This is the Prop Room. We store props and settings for our performances in here. 
I see. Looks like there's some interesting stuff in here. 
I'd like to take the time to look around, but we're still on patrol. Maybe some other time. 
From what I can tell, this looks like the prop room. 
Yes, that's right. We store prop and settings for our performances in here. 
Looks like everything's organized. Even a rat wouldn't be able to hide in here. 
(I hope Orihime won't make another fuss at tomorrow's rehearsal.) 
Ogami? You've been a bit silent, is something wrong? 
N-No, everything's fine. How about we head to the next room? 
So this is the Stage, huh? The Flower Division always holds their performances in this place, right? 
It just got renovated. Before, some of the sets had collapsed. 
Oh, I know! We're going to rehearse here tomorrow. 
I'll try to invite Orihime. 
I see, nice idea. 
Do you think that's a good idea? 
It's better not to ask. 
That's a nice idea. I'm sure she'll accept. 
Yes. I think it'll be a good chance to get to know her better. 
Are you sure that's a good idea? I don't know if she'll accept right away. 
It'll be fine! Orihime is a stage actress, just like us. 
I'm sure she'll join us. 
I don't think we should. She'll just make a scene like she did earlier today. 
Ogami, if you keep talking like that, Orihime will never open up, no matter how much time passes. 
R-Right... 
I think it'll be a good chance to get to know her better. I'll ask her tomorrow. 
Ah, I'm sorry for talking so much... We're still in the middle of patrolling. 
...Now let's get back to our night watch. 
So this is the Stage, huh? The Flower Division always holds their performances in this place, right? 
It just got renovated. Before, some of the sets had collapsed. 
I know! Orihime, we're going to rehearse in here soon. 
Would you like to join us? 
Rehearsal? 
I'm not really up for it, but I'll join you anyway. 
I want to see how skilled you all are at acting. 
O-OK. We're looking forward to it. 
Good luck tomorrow, you two. 
Let's continue our patrol, then. 
Zzzzzzzz... Zzzzzzzz... 
Sounds like Mr. Yoneda is asleep. Guess we'll just head to another room. 
This is the Manager's Office. I wonder if he's still here. 
Zzzzzzzz... Zzzzzzzz... 
Sounds like he's asleep. 
Mamma mia, that's a loud snore. 
Hehe, it really is, now that you mention it. 
It'd be bad if we wake him up, so we'll just leave him be. Let's check another room. 
This is the Secretarial Office. I filled out my arrival form in here earlier this afternoon. 
Seems like Kasumi and Yuri already went home. 
You sometimes help them sort their receipts in here, right, Ogami? 
Oh, jeez... Japanese men do so much work whether it's day or night, just like ants. 
Hahaha... Sorting the receipts is an important job, just like patrolling the theater. 
OK, doors are locked and nothing's out of place. Let's get going. 
Nothing strange in the Secretarial Office. Let's continue our patrol. 
This is the Visitor's Entrance. We welcome our special guests here. 
Let's check the door... Yep, it's locked tight. 
There's nothing odd in here. Let's get going, then. 
This is the Visitor's Entrance. We welcome our special guests here. 
Let's check the door... Yep, it's locked tight. 
So you have to check the locks yourself? Does this theater have a shortage of workers or something? 
This is part of the captain's duty. 
You think so? 
This is a part of the captain's duty. It's an important task in order to protect this theater. 
Ogami... 
Hmmm... That sounds plausible. 
Let's continue our patrol. Which room should we check after this? 
You think so too? And just after I returned here, too. 
Ogami, aren't you being a bit selfish right now? 
Seems like it was worth witnessing the true feelings of a Japanese man, however. 
What I need to do is just keep silent, and focus on doing my job right. 
OK, nothing's out of place. Let's continue our night patrol. 
Yes! 
Uh-huh... 
The doors have been locked. OK, let's check the next room. 
The doors have been locked. OK, let's check the next room. 
This is the Kitchen. Earlier, we made food for the welcoming party here. 
Let's check if the gas has been turned off. We don't want this theater to catch fire. 
OK, all good. The locks are working, too. Let's get going. 
This is the Kitchen. Earlier, we made food for the welcoming party here. 
The welcoming party was rather awful, but the food was delicious! 
Yeah, it was delicious. 
Is that so? I'm glad to hear that. 
OK, the gas is off, let's get going. 
OK, the gas is off, let's head to the next room. 
The Dining Hall has been renovated, so now it gives a different atmosphere. 
It feels rather quiet at night, don't you think? 
It does feel like that compared to how lively it usually is in the afternoon. 
Looks like there's nothing out of place, so let's get going. 
The Dining Hall has been renovated, so now it gives off a different atmosphere. 
So this is the Dining Hall? It seems rather cramped to me. 
Is that so? I think it's spacious enough already. 
Perhaps you think that because you come from a noble family. 
I can't help it. Now then, how about we get going? 
No one's around, let's check another room. 
The animals that have been hibernating are definitely going to wake up this season. 
Meanwhile, I'd get in trouble just for wanting to stay in bed a little longer than usual. 
Hahaha, you're right. It's tough to get out of bed when it's Spring. 
Let's get going. We can still catch a cold even if the weather's gotten warmer. 
No one's around. Makes sense, since it's already this late. 
Nothing odd in here. Let's get going. 
Is it that necessary to check outside here? 
No one's around. Let's get back inside and lock the door. 
Starting this year, the Flower Division will hold four different seasonal performances. 
This June, we'll be putting on "King Lear" for our summer performance. 
I'm looking forward to the play. 
Yes! Please do. 
Starting this year, the Flower Division will hold four different seasonal performances. 
This June, we'll be putting on "King Lear" for our summer performance. 
I'm looking forward to the play, it's a great story. 
Sounds like you already know quite a bit about "King Lear", Ensign. Surely you must know who wrote it, right? 
Dostoyevsky? 
Shakespeare? 
Mozart? 
It was... Dostoyevsky, wasn't it? 
Dostoyevsky was a Russian novelist. You got it completely wrong! 
King Lear" was written by Shakespeare. Isn't that common knowledge? 
O-Oh... Is that so. 
I'm tired of talking with such uncultured people, let's get back to your patrol. 
It was... Shakespeare, wasn't it? 
Huh, so you do know it, Ensign. 
But I doubt if you know the full plot. 
L-Let's put this topic aside and get back to our patrol. 
It was... Mozart, wasn't it? 
Mozart?! Seriously, are you joking or what? 
It was Shakespeare who wrote "King Lear." He was a playwright, 
while Mozart was a composer. Each of them are from a completely different field, you know. 
O-Oh... Is that so. 
If you want to act like a know-it-all, I suggest you to do it better. 
L-Let's put this topic aside and get back to our patrol. 
I... don't know who wrote it. 
But seriously, I'm looking forward to your performance of "King Lear." 
Uh-huh... That's better that acting like you know it all. 
Anyway, it was Shakespeare who wrote it. It's common knowledge, you know. 
Guys, let's put this topic aside and get back to our patrol. 
Looks like everything is in order. Let's go check another room. 
The Lobby sure is quiet now. It's usually crowded with people. 
Looks like everything is in order. Let's go check another room. 
The Lobby sure is quiet now. It's usually crowded with people. 
There's no point in staying here. 
Yeah. Let's check another room. 
Looks like everything is in order. Let's go check another room. 
Tsubaki sells photos at this gift shop during the day. 
Right, I already bought one. And it's your photo, Sakura. 
Huh?! For real? 
Here, take a look. 
It is... Oh, now I'm all embarrassed. 
But at the same time, it makes me quite happy see that, too. 
What are you two doing, wasting time like this? You need to get back to doing your rounds. 
Ah... I-I'm sorry. 
And you, Ensign, Quit flaunting that stuff around. 
You Japanese men are so blatantly shallow! 
S-Sorry. 
L-Let's continue patrolling. 
OK, let's continue patrolling. 
All right. 
I see. I'll drop by here next chance I get. 
I wanted to buy a photo, but Tsubaki's not around. I'll have to visit again tomorrow afternoon. 
This is the entrance hall. It's the theater's main entrance. 
Let's check the door... Yep, it's locked tight. 
There's nothing odd in here. Let's get going, then. 
This is the entrance hall. It's the theater's main entrance.

So you have to check the locks yourself? Does this theater have a shortage of workers or something?

You think so?

Ogami... 
Hmmm... That sounds plausible. 
Let's continue our patrol. Which room should we check after this? 
You think so too? And just after I returned here, too. 
Ogami, you're being selfish! 
Seems like it was worth witnessing the true feelings of a Japanese man, however. 
What I need to do is just keep silent, and focus on doing my job right. 
OK, everything's good here. Let's continue patrolling. 
Yes! 
Uh-huh... 
The doors have been locked. OK, let's check the next room. 
The doors have been locked. OK, let's check the next room. 
Ogami, the Basement is undergoing renovations right now, so access is restricted. 
Renovations, huh? I wonder what they're working on down there. 
The workers are redoing the Swimming Pool and the Infirmary. The shower room is being converted into a Japanese-style bath house, too. 
Nothing can beat a bath house. 
Bath house, eh? 
Nothing can beat a good old bath house. 
I hope it'll be mixed gender... 
Nothing can beat a Japanese bath house. Sink your body into a large tub and all the day's troubles just seems to melt away. 
Agreed, I can't wait to see it when they're finished. 
...Japanese bath house? Don't tell me it's another thing made out of grass. 
Don't worry. I'm positive that you'll like it. 
Anyway, please keep in mind that the Basement is a restricted area for now. 
Bath house, eh? 
Ogami, are you having lewd thoughts? 
N-No, I-I'm just thinking about what the finished product will look like. 
Your face tells me otherwise. 
Y-You're just being paranoid! L-Let's just continue our patrol! 
I hope it'll be mixed gender... 
Ogami, you shouldn't say things like that out loud! 
So this is the real you, huh?! Just as I thought, Japanese men are deceptive and shallow! 
I-I'm kidding! Just kidding! Don't take it so seriously! 
Well, you sounded like you were serious about it. 
Anyways, Ogami, the Basement is a restricted area for now. Get it? 
Y-Yeah. Got it. 
OK then, let's get back to doing the night watch.. 
Ogami, I already said that the Basement access is restricted for now. 
Ah... R-Right. I totally forgot about that. 
You're not pretending to forget, are you? 
L-Let's get back to patrol! Where should we head next? 
This is the Library. It has quite a lot of books. 
Mr. Yoneda told me that some of Japan's rarest books are kept here, too. 
Interesting. I'll try to read a few next time. 
This is the Library. It has quite a lot of books. 
Ohhhh. So you do have this kind of space. 
Mr. Yoneda told me that some of Japan's rarest books are kept here, too. 
Interesting. I'll try to read a few next time. 
How about you reading Shakespeare as well, Ensign? 
Everything's fine in here, let's continue patroling. 
Ayame... This used to be her room. 
Right, Ayame... She's not with us anymore. 
Even so, we'll never forget about her. 
We'll always remember that smile she had. 
Ayame... This used to be her room. 
Ayame? Who's that? 
She used to be the Deputy Commander of the Imperial Assault Troupe. 
Right, Ayame... She's not with us anymore. 
Even so, we'll never forget about her. 
We'll always remember that smile she had. 
This room is still empty. There's no need to check it out, then. 
Ogami, we're in the middle of night watch. 
We need to keep inspecting the theater until 10 o'clock. 
S-Sorry. 
Ogami, we're in the middle of night watch. 
We need to keep inspecting the theater until 10 o'clock. 
So, were you planning to go back to your own room? 
S-Sorry. 
Ogami, remember, we're still on patrol. 
This is the game room. It recently got added to the theater. 
There's a lot of stuff in here. It all looks like fun. 
Well, Iris and I haven't actually used this room yet. 
Let's get going. There are still some rooms we need to inspect. 
This is the game room. It recently got added to the theater. 
There's a lot of stuff in here. It all looks like fun. 
I don't think we have much time to spend in here. Let's get going. 
I did want to play in the game room for a bit, but we're still in the middle of patrol. Let's hold off for now. 
Ooh, this room is quite stylish. 
This is the salon. We just redecorated with new furniture and other decorations in here. 
Sumire gave out lots of orders when we were working. 
Hahaha, that certainly sounds like her. 
It's definitely because this is her favorite place to spend time in. 
OK, we better get going. Everything's in order. 
Nobody's here. Let's continue our patrol. 
This is second floor seating. 
The first floor is for general seats, while the second floor is seating for VIPs. 
There's no doubt that these seats will sell out when I'm on stage. 
Hahaha, OK. 
Well, looks like everything's fine in here. Let's check another room. 
Looks like everything's in order here. Let's check another room. 
...Huh? Where'd Sakura go? 
Oh, there you are, Sakura. 
Ogami, come here. Look outside. 
Oh, wow. Ginza at night... 
Two years ago, when I just arrived in Tokyo, I didn't know anything about the city. 
This view was the first thing I fell in love with here. 
Since then I... I wanted to be as bright as the street lights down there. 
I wanted my performances to be as beautiful as the street lights that shine with the other lights of the city. 
I swore to be a beacon of strength and warmth to the capital, just like how they guide people to their destination. 
I want to be that kind of light. Even now, that's what I strive to become. 
Orihime may seem pretty hostile, but I understand her feelings. 
She must be feeling the same way I did back then. 
Nervous about being in a new place, but unable to come out and say it... 
But I believe that someday Orihime will see these lights with us... 
And she'll appreciate their beauty like we do. 
Sakura... 
Sorry... I ended up talking too much. We're still in the middle of our patrol. 
Now then, let's get going. 
This is the hall. Take the stairway down, and we'll reach the lobby on the first floor. 
Iris likes to slide down the banister, even though I told her it's dangerous. 
Look's like no one's here, so how about we get going? 
You're right. Let's check another room. 
No one's here. Let's continue our patrol. 
Orihime, look, you can see Ginza's nightscape from here and the street lamps. 
Are those tiny lights down there supposed to be special? 
... 
Someday you'll understand the beauty of those lights. I'm sure of it. 
...Now let's get back to our night watch. 
Looks like everything's in order, so let's get going. 
We're at... What room is this? 
This room is empty, no one is using it. 
The door's locked so we can't get inside. It seems OK, though. 
Jeez... You must be daft to think that we should check on an empty room. 
This room is empty, Ogami. 
Is that so? Well, we better check another room. 
This is my room. We're still in the middle of patrol, so let's check somewhere else. 
This is my room. 
You're thinking of entering that room, aren't you, Ensign? 
Just for inspection. 
H-How did you know?! 
Just for inspection. I have no intentions other than that. 
Is that so? A convenient excuse. 
Never mind that, there's nothing's strange in there. Let's just continue with our patrol. 
H-How did you know?! 
You're a Japanese man, I figured you were up to no good. 
It seems like I hit the nail on the head. 
Ogami, did you really come here for that reason? 
Ah, no, that's... 
Let's go. We're not done yet. 
Oooh, she's angry at you, Ensign. Well, you reap what you sow. 
Are you ignoring me?! Now that gets me angry! 
Now, now, Orihime. It's because you asked him something so unexpected. 
Let's get going, OK? There's still some rooms we need to check. 
I don't think there's anything wrong with my room. Let's go somewhere else. 
This is Kanna's room. Right now she's back home in Okinawa. 
I see, so we can't get inside then. 
Yep. Members of the theater need to lock their rooms if they aren't going to be here. 
Then we just have to move on. Let's head to another room. 
Guess we just have to move on. Let's head to another room. 
Oh right, Kanna's not here. We'll just go to another room then. 
This is Orihime's room. 
Yes? Who is it? 
Uh, it's Ogami. 
I thought I already told you. No night patrol! 
I'm going to sleep now, so don't ask me again! 
Let's just get going, Ogami. She'll get angry again if we keep insisting. 
Ogami, she'll just get angry if we keep pestering her. 
The name plate has a simple design, but it sure looks classy. 
...Let's just check another room. 
This is Orihime's room. 
Oh, right. Wait a second. 
I wonder if she's all right. 
Open the door. 
Knock first. 
Open the door. 
I'm worried about her, let's go inside. 
Ogami! It's rude to enter someone's room without permission! 
I can't wait any longer. Come on, we're going in. 
E-Ensign?! What are you doing here? 
Uh, it's... I was worried why you hadn't left your room... 
I was just fixing my hair! 
I can't believe you would just barge into another people's room like that! 
Get out! I'm not doing your stupid patrol anymore! 
I knew Orihime would get angry at you, Ogami. 
Looks like we'll have to continue the patrol with just the two of us. 
Orihime, is everything OK in there? 
Just a second. 
Thanks for waiting! I was just fixing my hair. 
(Huh? All that time just for that?) 
OK, let's continue our patrol! 
Thanks for waiting! I was just fixing my hair. 
(Huh? All that time just for that?) 
OK, let's continue our patrol! 
Everything's all right in my room. Let's check another! 
This is Maria's room. She visiting America right now. 
Oh, so she left before I got here. 
We can't go inside, then. 
Yep. Members of the theater need to lock their rooms if they aren't going to be here. 
We can't do much right now, so we better check another room. 
Maria is in America, huh. Let's check another room, then. 
Huh? The door's open. 
I wonder if something happened, let's peek inside. 
Iris isn't here. Where would she go at this hour? 
Perhaps she went to toilet? 
Ogami, let's look for her while we check the rest of the theater. 
Yeah, let's go. 
I wonder where Iris went. 
Hmmm... She's not here. 
I wonder, where is she? 
I wonder if she's already went back to bed. 
Zzz... Zzz... 
Hehe, she's already sound asleep. 
Good grief, kids are so carefree. 
That's a relief. OK, let's get back to our patrol. 
Ogami, Iris is sleeping, so let's leave her alone. 
You're right. Let's continue our patrol, then. 
This is Kohran's room. She's at the Hanayashiki Branch for work right now. 
Hanayashiki Branch? What's that? 
It's the Imperial Assault Troupe's research lab in Asakusa. 
On the surface it's an amusement park, but the workshop and labs are located below ground. 
Oh. 
Since Kohran is away, we can't go inside. 
Yep. Members of the theater need to lock their rooms if they aren't going to be here. 
Guess we just have to move on. Let's head to another room. 
Kohran's at Hanayashiki right now. Guess we'll have to check another room. 
This is Sumire's room. At the moment she's back home with her family. 
Can't she still commute if she lives so close by? 
I think she has a lot of family matters to attend to right now. 
Her door's locked. Let's head to another room. 
Sumire went back to her family home. Guess we'll just have to check another room. 
This is the Attic. Seems that no one's here. 
The windows are all locked tight as well. 
Everything's fine, then. Let's check another room. 
This is the Attic. Seems that no one's here. 
The windows are all locked tight as well. 
Hmmm... 
Huh? Something wrong, Orihime? 
Oh, no. It's nothing. 
Let's get to the next room right away! 
Looks like everything's in order here. Let's check another room. 
It's 10 o'clock. 
We finished our night watch. Great job, Ogami. 
You too, Sakura. Thanks for coming with me. 
Don't mention it. 
I'll walk you to your room. 
Good night. 
I'll walk you back to your room. 
But Ogami, we're already at my room. 
Ah, right, now that you mention it. 
Hehe... That funny side of you has never changed, Ogami. 
I'll just appreciate the offer, then. Thank you very much. 
Now, if you excuse me. Good night. 
Yeah, good night. 
Now, I better get back to my room, too. 
Is that OK with you? 
Of course. Let's go. 
Thank you so much for taking me back to my room. 
Tomorrow, I'll ask Orihime to join our rehearsal. 
It'll be a good chance to chat with her. 
Thanks, Ogami. Good night. 
Yeah, good night. 
Now, I better get back to my room, too. 
Well, take care on your way back, Sakura. Good night. 
Thank you, Ogami. Now if you excuse me, good night. 
Now, I better get back to my room, too. 
I'll excuse myself now. Good night, Ogami. 
Yeah, good night. 
Now, I better get back to my room, too. 
It's 10 o'clock. 
We finished our night watch. Great job, Ogami. 
And thank you for coming with us, Orihime. 
There's not a lot of room in the theater, so it was a good chance to stretch my legs. 
We'll part here. 
I'll take you two to your room. 
Good night, you two. 
I'll take you two to your room. 
But Ogami, we're already at my room. 
Ah, right, now that you mention it. 
Hehe... That funny side of you has never changed, Ogami. 
Funny" side more like "oblivious" to me. 
Ogami, would you like to escort Orihime so she won't get lost? 
Thank you, but I vehemently reject that idea. 
Imagining myself being escorted by a Japanese man makes my hair stand on end. 
I'll take my leave now. Good night. 
Oh, boy... Seems that she really hates me. 
Tomorrow, I'll ask Orihime to join our rehearsal. 
It'll be a good chance to chat with her. 
Thanks again, Ogami. Good night. 
Yeah, good night. 
Now, I better get back to my room, too. 
Excuse me, but my room is right there, behind you guys. 
Ah, right, now that you mention it. 
Uh-huh... Ensign really is as dumb as he looks, huh. 
And one more thing, I vehemently reject the idea of you walking me to my room. 
Imagining myself being escorted by a Japanese man makes my hair stand on end. 
I'll take my leave now. Good night. 
Oh, boy... Seems that she really hates me. 
I'll walk you to your room, Sakura. 
I'll take you up on that offer. Thank you. 
Thanks for taking me back to my room. 
Tomorrow, I'll ask Orihime to join our rehearsal. 
It'll be a good chance to chat with her. 
Thanks again, Ogami. Good night. 
Yeah, good night. 
Now, I better get back to my room, too. 
Is that OK with you? 
Of course. Let's go. 
Thank you, but I vehemently reject that idea. 
Imagining myself being escorted by a Japanese man makes my hair stand on end. 
I'll take my leave now. Good night. 
Oh, boy... Seems that she really hates me. 
I'll walk you to your room, Sakura. 
I'll take you up on that offer. Thank you. 
Thanks for taking me back to my room. 
Tomorrow, I'll ask Orihime to join our rehearsal. 
It'll be a good chance to chat with her. 
Thanks again, Ogami. Good night. 
Yeah, good night. 
Now, I better get back to my room, too. 
Well, take care on your way back, Sakura. Good night. 
No need to say anything to me, I'll be headed back right away. 
I'm leaving too, Ogami. Good night. 
Now, I better get back to my room, too. 
Excuse us for now. Good night, Ogami. 
Yeah, good night. 
Now, I better get back to my room, too. 
I wonder if Orihime and I can ever get along... 
It is my duty to make sure that happens. But, we still have a long way to go. 
Ogami, have you finished sorting those receipts? 
Just a little bit! 
Phew, it's hard to do this stuff again such a long time. 
OK, just need to finish counting these receipts and we're done. 
Um, how many is it... 126, 127, 128... 
Ogami, are you done yet? 
Hold on, just a little bit more! 
Uh-oh, how many receipts was it? What was the next number? 
127? 
129? 
131? 
127 receipts, I guess. OK... 128, 129, 130, 131, 132... 
OK, all done! I'm free at last! 
129 receipts, I guess. OK... 130, 131, 132, 133, 134... 
OK, all done! I'm free at last! 
131 receipts, I guess. OK... 132, 133, 134, 135, 136... 
OK, all done! I'm free at last! 
Oh, dang. I forgot how many receipts I counted! 
Guees I'll just wing it. Right, 401, 402, 403... 
Great work, Ogami. 
I haven't sorted receipts in a while. Sorry it took me so long. 
Too bad our performance hasn't started yet, you couldn't do \nyour "actual" job as a ticket puncher. 
Well, it's not that big a disappointment to me. 
Ogami, I double-checked the receipts that you counted, and it seems that you were short by two. 
Really? Looks like I miscounted somewhere, sorry. 
No, it's fine. I understand you haven't done this in a long time. 
Thank you very much. We'll reach out to you again if there's something we need help with. 
Your count matches with our records, Ogami. Thank you so much for helping us. 
Oh, glad to hear that. I was worried I might have miscounted them or something. 
Way to go, Ogami! You're great at doing all sorts of odd-jobs. 
Uh-huh... I wonder if I should be happy about that. 
Ogami, I double-checked the receipts that you counted, and it seems that you counted two extra. 
Really? Looks like I miscounted somewhere, sorry. 
No, it's fine. I understand you haven't done this in a long time. 
Thank you very much. We'll reach out to you again if there's something we need help with. 
Ogami, I double-checked the receipts that you counted, and your counts are messed up. 
I'm sorry, truth is I lost count while I was working on it. 
I understand that you haven't done this job in ages, but please be more careful next time. 
I'm really sorry, I'll try to pay more attention. 
Well, I'm leaving. Thanks for having me. 
Thank you for your hard work! 
It's already evening. Man, I've been sorting receipts all day. 
I wonder if the gift shop is still open. Or perhaps I should visit the rehearsal. 
Visit the gift shop. 
Visit the rehearsal. 
I'll visit the gift shop, maybe Tsubaki's there. 
Hey, Ogami! Would you like to buy something? 
Buy a photo. 
Talk to Tsubaki. 
Leave. 
Could I buy a photo? 
Ogami, I think you already bought one. 
We need to keep enough in stock for the other customers, so please enjoy the one you bought for now. 
You'd like to buy a photo? Thank you very much! 
Oh, right, I have a request to make, Ogami... 
We need to keep enough photos in stock for the other visitors, so please limit your purchases to one per month. 
While I'm sure you'd like to collect more, I hope you'll understand the need to do this for the sake of our patrons. 
That's a photo of Sakura. 
It seems like Sakura was really looking forward to your return, Ogami. 
How about buying a photo to show your support for her? 
Let's see... Sakura's photo, right? 
That'll be 50 sen. Thank you very much! 
That's a photo of Sumire.

Let's see... Kanna's photo, right? 
That'll be 50 sen. Thank you very much! 
That's a photo of Iris. 
I bet Iris would be pretty lonely without everybody in the Flower Division keeping her company. 
Make sure you're kind to her, Ogami. 
Let's see... Iris's photo, right? 
That'll be 50 sen. Thank you very much! 
That's a photo of Kohran. 
Kohran's off doing some work at the Hanayashiki Branch right now.

You don't want to buy anything? That's too bad... 
Orihime joined the Flower Division just recently, she's a beautiful actress! 
I'm looking forward to seeing what kind of performance she can pull off. 
Haha... Well, I suppose you're right. 
We're going to start selling Orihime's photo starting next month, so please look forward to that in the future. 
There will be a special bonus for customers who buy a photo every month. 
Bonus? What kind is it? 
Hehehe... It's a secret! 
Well, I should be going. Keep up the good work. 
Thank you very much! Come back again soon! 
Thank you very much! Come back and buy another photo next month! 
I'll visit the rehearsal next. I wonder if Orihime is getting along with the other. 
Mon Frère!! 
Iris, what happened? Why are you over here? 
Listen, we were doing rehearsal onstage. 
And then, Orihime started fighting with Sakura. We're in trouble! 
Wha... What did you say? 
Please break up their fight, Mon Frère. Please! 
OK, I got you. We're going there right away! 
Right here, Mon Frère! Quick! 
Like I said! No matter how many times you do it, this rehearsal is pointless! 
It's just like Iris said. They're getting pretty heated up. 
It's not useless! Reading though our lines is important for rehearsal. 
How do you think we're supposed to act if we don't do a read-through beforehand? 
What's important in performing on stage is inspiration! 
To act is to have a talent. There's no need to for me to rehearse like this! 
But read-through also works as a practice session for the actors so that they can get in sync with each other. 
I want us to get along and coordinated for our upcoming performance. 
That's why I suggested a rehearsal so our acting can synchronize with each other. 
MY acting is on a different level than your "acting." 
You guys have the wrong idea. The stage is just like any battlefield. 
You don't need to pretend to be my friend anymore. I'm out of here. 
Ah, Orihime! Wait, please! 
Orihime! 
Oh, Ensign? Eavesdropping on us? What a nice hobby. 
Y-You got it all wrong! I'm just worried about you two! 
Just as I thought. Japanese men are the worst. 
You're a meddlesome coward. On top of that, you like to stick your nose in other people's business. 
And Cherry- Er, Sakura lacks any sense at all. Non ha senso! I can't stand her! 
I'm going back to Italy. Now, out of my way! 
Stay there. 
Move out of the way. 
No, I'm staying right here. 
Are you deaf? I said, get out of my way! 
No, I will not. I'm not going to let you leave here like that. 
Hmph... Seems that my words aren't enough to make you understand. 
Uwah! 
Ah, Mon frère! 
O-Ogami! 
There, now you're dripping with charm. 
I don't care if you're the captain or whatever, stop meddling in other peoples' business. 
From your perspective, it may look like I'm sticking my nose into your business. 
I was hoping that you could get along with everyone in the Flower Division. 
Orihime, I'm asking you as a fellow member of the division, please stand with us. 
Stand together, in the Imperial Theater and on the battlefield. 
Mon Frère... 
Ogami... 
... 
OK, I'll move. 
Ha! How nice of you to be so considerate. 
For a cowardly and boorish Japanese man like yourself, I'm impressed. 
Well now, I'm going back to my room! 
Hold it, Orihime! Aren't you also being a coward by running away like that? 
What do you mean by that, Sakura? 
To quit and run away in the middle of rehearsal, you're a coward, too! 
... 
It's true that I may look like an amateur in front of you. 
That's why I want to rehearse, so that I learn lots of things from you! 
Please stand with us on the stage, Orihime! 
And please stand together with us on the battlefield! Become one of our comrades in the Flower Division! 
Hmm... 
... 
So you're ignoring me? Fine, I'll just force my way past you! 
Ah! 
What's that sound? 
It's time to suit up for a mission! We have enemies incoming! 
I'm asking you once again, Orihime. 
Please fight together with us, as a member of the Flower Division. 
... 
This'll be fun! I've always wanted to run wild during a battle in Japan at least once. 
I'll show you guys my true power, the power of a world class actress! 
Thanks a lot, Orihime. 
Just so you know, this is the only time I'll head into battle. 
OK, Orihime, let's head to the Command Room right away! 
Imperial Assault Troupe, Flower Division, assembled! 
Hm, great work. Seems like Orihime even managed to get here as well. 
Ooooh. So we have a room like this in the basement, huh? 
This is our Command Room, the heart of the Imperial Assault Troupe. 
The Theater is just a cover to keep out of the public eye. The troupe's real job is to protect the capital. 
This will be your first battle since coming back to us, Ogami. 
This is amazing. I'm suddenly not afraid of anything anymore because you're here with us, Ogami. 
I know that we won't lose as long you're here! 
Let's do our best for the sake of peace, Ogami! 
If you're in danger, I'll come to save you, Mon Frère! 
Let's do our best together! 
I'll show all of you my bountiful abilities! 
I can't believe I'm tagging along. Guess I'm curious, too. 
Thanks, everyone. I'm counting on you! 
Good. Now then, Ogami, is there anything you want to ask? 
About the enemy 
About Orihime's uniform 
Nothing in particular 
I'd like to know about the enemies. What kind will we be encountering? 
Hm... The thing is, we're still unsure. 
But what we do know is that something with lots of spirit power is headed straight for us. 
What? Then their target must be... 
Yes. It's possible they are targeting us, the Flower Division, in this theater. 
Also, the sun has set. It's going to be a nighttime battle, so be on your guard. 
Orihime, your uniform is different from ours. 
This is my uniform from when I was assigned to the "Star Division." 
Star Division? 
It was a test squad that was formed before the Flower Division. 
They gathered pilots from all around the world to form that elite unit. 
That's right! In terms of experience, I'm your senior! 
Now, one more thing I need to tell you before you deploy. 
We can't fight the monsters who attack Tokyo with just our bodies. 
That's why you're all piloting mechanical armor, or rather, "Spirit Armor." 
My Spi-rit-Ar-mor is also ready, too! 
I'll show you all your new Spirit Armor. We're going to the Hangar now. 
T-These are our new Spirit Armor!? 
Correct. These are new revisions of the old "Koubu" models. Thus we've named them the "Koubu Kai." 
They've got increased power output after we studied and modified the ones we lost in our previous battle. 
These Koubu are still the same, only people with enough spirit power can pilot them. 
You all are the ones who possess that spirit power. 
The safety of Tokyo depends on the Flower Division. I'm counting on you! 
Roger! 
Ogami! 
What is it, Sakura? Did something happen? 
Orihime said that she was moving out by herself and then left! 
W-What the?! 
That's... That's the sound of a Spirit Armor's engine! 
It's coming from the Hangar. It's must be her! 
Wh-What is that?! 
Heya, Ensign! I'm going to head out first! 
With my "Eisenkleid" from the Star Division, I can take care of everything myself. 
W-Wait up, Orihime!! 
This is a perfect chance to show my power to you guys. 
I'm going first, guys! Orihime Soletta moving out! 
What in the world. Heading off alone into battle is reckless! 
Orihime got your hands tied, huh, Ogami? 
Remember, protecting, covering, and getting your squadmates to open up to you is your duty as captain of the Flower Division. 
Now go, Ogami! I'm leaving Ginza and Orihime in your hands! 
Ogami, give the order! 
Imperial Assault Troupe, Flower Division, move out! 
Prepare for cherry blossom viewing! 
We're going to join up with Orihime and take out the enemy! Imperial Assault Troop, Flower Division, move out! 
Understood! 
Let's do this, Mon Frère! 
We're gonna protect the capital! 
OK, we're gonna prepare for cherry blossom viewing! 
Whaaat!? We're going to see the cherry blossoms now? 
I get it! We're going to redo Orihime's welcoming party after we win this battle, right? 
General Yoneda, please get things ready for our cherry blossom party! 
Yep, I'll leave this matter to you! Hehe, make sure I can enjoy my best sake! 
You can count on us! Let's go, Ogami! Moving out! 
Hey, Ogami! Don't just stand there! Give the order! 
Oh... R-Right. 
Here goes... Imperial Assault Troupe, Flower Division, move out! Our destination is... 
Uh... Where was it, again? 
I told you, it's Ginza! Ginza! Right in front of the Theater! 
Are you all right, Mon Frère? 
He's just got back to the Flower Division, so he probably hasn't gotten used to being in battle yet. 
We're going now, Ogami! Flower Division, move out! 
Sorry, Ogami, but each customer is only allowed to purchase one photo at a time. 
I see. That's too bad... 
My apologies, Ogami, but each customer is only allowed to purchase one photo at a time. 
Oh, really? That's too bad...
