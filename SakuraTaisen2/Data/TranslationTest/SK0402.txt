Ahh, so that's what happened, eh? 
Guess that means that starting today, we've got our own little doggy! 
Yaaaay! We've got a new friend! 
Arf, arf! 
We should come up with a name for this little pup. 
Yeah. Looks like he's a boy, so I wonder what sort of name would be best... 
We oughta name him somethin' manly, so he'll grow up nice an' strong. 
What?! No, let's pick a cute name! 
Ogami, how about you ask everyone for their opinions and then decide for us? 
We're counting on you. 
Why don't we call him "Shiro"? 
It means white, and he has such beautiful white fur, after all. I think it fits perfectly. 
I think "Shiro" is a great name. 
All right, let's go with Shiro. 
Let me think on it a bit longer. 
I see you've changed into a summer outfit. 
All right, let's go with Shiro. 
Let me think on it a bit longer. 
All right, let's go with Shiro. White is the first thing you see when you look at him, so it really does fit perfectly. 
Is that so? I'm glad to hear that. 
All right, it's decided, then! Welcome to the team, Shiro! 
Arf, arf! Woof! 
Let me think on it a bit longer. Since we're giving him a name, I want to be sure it's the right one. 
Sure. Go find out what the others think and decide on a nice name for him. 
I see you've changed into your summer outfit too, Sakura. 
Yes. I'm really pleased to hear that you like it, Ogami. 
Ooh, what's up? Did something happen with you and the Chief? 
Heheh, that's a seeeecret. Right, Ogami? 
Uh, y-yeah. 
That summer dress looks great on you. 
I thought you said you preferred my usual outfit. 
Uh... I mean... 
Haha, I'm just kidding. Thanks for saying so. 
What do you think, Ogami? Does it suit me? 
Yeah, you look fantastic wearing that, Sakura. 
Th-Thank you. I'm happy to hear... that you think it looks good. 
You didn't say anything earlier, so I felt kind of nervous. 
How nice, Sakura. He said it looks good on you. 
Looking at this dog, a name springs to mind right away. 
Oh, what name? 
Hanamaru." It has an elegant lilt to it, yes? 
Since it carries the meaning of flowers, don't you think it's a fitting name for a new member of the Flower Division? 
Indeed, any other name is simply unthinkable. Don't you agree, Ensign? 
All right, let's go with Hanamaru. 
Let me think on it a bit longer. 
Your summer outfit looks nice. 
All right, let's go with Hanamaru. 
Let me think on it a bit longer. 
All right, let's go with Hanamaru. You're right Sumire, it's a really fitting name. 
Ohohoho! I knew that I could count upon you to have good sense in names, Ensign! 
OK, then it's decided. This pup's name will be Hanamaru. 
Let's get along, Hanamaru! 
Arf, arf! Woof! 
Let me think on it a bit longer. Since we're giving him a name, I want to be sure it's the right one. 
Consider it as long as you must. I'm certain you will realize that my name is the best choice. 
I don't know too much about clothing, but I think your summer outfit looks nice. 
Ensign! Have you not said the exact same thing to each one of us?! 
Uh... S-Sorry. 
Heavens, what a tremendously rude way to treat a lady! 
Ensign... My deepest thanks. 
You certainly do have good taste. How delightful. 
Well, I think "Dai" would be a good name for 'im. 
He's just a lil' guy right now, but if we name him "Dai" like the word for "big", he'll grow up big and strong. 
I think my name suits him best. 
All right, let's go with Dai. 
Let me think on it a bit longer. 
Your summer clothes look really cool. 
All right, let's go with Dai. 
Let me think on it a bit longer. 
Dai is a great name, if you ask me. I'm sure he'll grow into a big, healthy dog. 
Heheh, you think so too, Boss? This lil' guy's got a lot of potential, I'm sure of it. 
Looks like you've got a name, Dai. And it's a good one, too! 
Arf, arf, arf!! 
Let me think on it a bit longer. Since we're giving him a name, I want to be sure it's the right one. 
Take your time and don't rush it. He's gonna carry whatever name we give 'im his whole life, after all. 
By the way, Kanna... That's not your usual karate gi, is it? It looks good on you, though. 
C-C'mon, Boss, what're you talkin' about? Let's come up with a name for this lil' guy first! 
Heavens, Kanna, your face has turned the brightest shade of red. Whatever could be the matter? 
Gimme a break, Sumire! The Boss is over here sayin' all this weird stuff, that's all. 
I thought of a name too, Mon Frère. 
How about "Torte"? Wouldn't it be so cute to name him after something sweet? 
Come on, let's call him "Torte." Look, he's even wagging his tail! So I'm sure he likes it, too. 
All right, let's go with Torte. 
Let me think on it a bit longer. 
Your summer outfit looks wonderful on you. 
All right, let's go with Torte. 
Let me think on it a bit longer. 
All right, let's go with Torte, then. 
Really? Hoorayyy!! 
It's nice to meet you, Torte. This is my bear, Jean-Paul. I hope you'll be friends with him. 
What a cute name you've been given, Torte! 
Arf, arf! Woof! 
I see... I'm going to give some thought to the other names, too. 
Aww, you don't wanna use "Torte"? But I think it's a good name... 
I see you've changed into your summer clothes as well, Iris. 
Hee hee, I knew you'd notice, Mon Frère! So you think it looks good on me, right? Right? 
Yeah, it does. It's such a cute outfit, it suits you perfectly. 
Eheheh... Thanks, Mon Frère. 
I had a hunch things might end up like this, so I thought up a name on the way back from the hospital. 
And that name is "Long"! It's the Chinese word for "dragon." 
Right now he's just a little squirt, but we want him to grow big enough to stretch toward the heavens, like a dragon... 
That's the feel I was going for, anyway. Sounds awesome, right?! 
So, whaddaya think of "Long"? I think it's pretty great, myself. 
All right, let's go with Long. 
Let me think on it a bit longer. 
That must be your summer outfit. 
All right, let's go with Long. 
Let me think on it a bit longer. 
All right, let's go with Long. A dragon big enough to reach the heavens... Yeah, it's a great name. 
That's what I'm talking about! You always seem to get me, Chief. 
Come here, Long! 
Arf, arf, arf!! 
Yaaay! He knows when we say his name! 
Arf, arf!! 
Let me think on it a bit longer. I might decide to go with a different name. 
Sure thing. Think it over real good. 
That must be your summer outfit. It looks really good on you. 
Huh? If you're talking about this old thing, it's what I always wear. Did you hit your head or something? 
Well, it's just that when I take a closer look at it, I feel like it really does suit you perfectly. 
Aww, Chief... Butter me up all you want, it won't get you anywhere. 
Let me see... What do you think of "Altair"? 
It is one of the stars of Tanabata. In Japan you call it "Hikoboshi." 
Now is the season for Tanabata, so I'm thinking this name is very timely. 
Altair"... It's such a romantic, mysterious name. 
All right, let's go with Altair. 
Let me think on it a bit longer. 
Your summer outfit looks nice. 
All right, let's go with Altair. 
Let me think on it a bit longer. 
All right, let's go with Altair! From the star "Hikoboshi"... Orihime is the other star, so it matches your name, then. 
That's true. And Altair is such a mighty-sounding name, too. 
How about that, Altair? Since I have given you the name of my partner... 
You must grow up into a splendid dog. Do you understand? 
Arf, arf, arf!! 
I wonder if any of the other names would be better... I'm going to think on it a bit longer. 
Mamma mia, Japanese men are so indecisive. 
I thought something seemed different, but it looks as though you've just changed into a summer dress. 
Wh-Why do you say this, all of the sudden?! 
I don't know much of anything about clothes, but I like it a lot. 
I-Is that right...? 
Your face is sooo red, Orihime! If you're happy, you should just say so! 
How very rare to see her looking so flustered. 
I-I am not flustered even in the least! 
Mamma mia, it was only because the Ensign said such a strange thing. Just forget it! 
Hmph. This is why I hate Japanese men. They are all so insincere. 
Insincere? That wasn't my intention at all... 
You've gone around and told all of us how nice we look, have you not? 
How am I to believe anyone so loose with his words? 
I see... I'm sorry. I guess it was pretty thoughtless of me. 
Reni, have you thought of any good names for him? 
... 
Anything is fine. Just tell me the first name that comes to mind. 
...Hund. 
Hund? 
The German word for "dog." 
Hmm... 
...But if you don't want to use it, that's fine, too. 
All right, let's go with Hund. 
Let me think on it a bit longer. 
Your summer outfit looks nice. 
All right, let's go with Hund. 
Let me think on it a bit longer. 
All right, let's go with Hund since you took the time to come up with it. 
... 
Still, naming a dog "Dog" doesn't sound quite right, does it? 
Whaddya mean? Kohran here gives her weird machines all kinds of weird names. 
And those are at least a hundred times more weird than this, right? 
What's the big idea, dragging me into this?! 
Heheh, how nice for you, Hund. I hope we become good friends. 
Arf, arf! Woof! 
Hmm, it's not quite fitting... Maybe I'll go with something else. 
... 
Oh, that looks like a nice, cool outfit. It suits you pretty well. 
... 
How nice, Reni! Mon Frère thinks you look cute. 
I see... Then I am pleased. 
Ever the stoic, aren't you, Reni? 
Based on the typical temperature and humidity of Japan, this clothing provides the most maneuverability. 
O-OK... 
Ogami, please pick a good name for this pup. 
Hey, Chief, are you gonna run off without giving this poor doggy a name? 
Mon Frère, what should we name the puppy?! 
Ogami, please pick a good name for this pup. 
Oh, it looks like [dog] 
likes his name, too. 
Since we've decided on a name for the dog, why don't we disperse for the time being? 
In that case, I will be found in the music room, playing on the piano. 
I think I might take a bath and then do some sword training in the courtyard. 
Guess we're gonna get going, then. Later, Boss. 
Well then... I've got some time until dinner. I guess I'll wander around the theater. 
Hey, Chief, do you have a second? 
What is it, Kohran? You sound serious. 
There's something I wanna bend your ear about. Mind coming to my room at 4 o'clock? 
Sure, I'll be there. 
Sorry... I'm a bit busy right now. 
Why not right now? 
Sure, I'll be there. Your room, 4 o'clock. Got it. 
Thank you kindly! I knew you'd come through for me. 
Then I'll be waiting for you in my room at 4. Later gator! 
Sorry... I'm a bit busy right now. 
Y'know, I never said it had to be right now. 
C'mon Chief, don't give me the cold shoulder like that. I just need you an hour from now. 
Hmm... I see. In that case, I'll come to your room at 4. 
Alrighty. Then I'll be waiting for you, Chief! 
You want to talk? Why not right now? 
That's a no-go. I'll be busy for at least the next hour, that's why I asked. 
I see. In that case, I'll head to your room at 4. 
Sorry, I hope asking that doesn't make me sound too big-headed. Anyway, I'll be waiting in my room at 4! 
... 
Still with me, Chief? 
Oh, uh, sorry. Um... What were you saying? 
...Listen. 
I wanna talk to you about something, so I need you to meet me at my room at 4 o'clock. 
R-Right, I got it. 4 o'clock, I'll be there. 
I'll be waiting in my room then. Later gator, Chief! 
I wonder what it is that she needs me to come to her room for? 
If I'm meeting her at 4, then I've got an hour to kill. Guess I'll find something to do until then. 
Oh, it's Reni. 
Hey, Reni. Nice weather, huh? 
... 
So, uh... Are you getting some sunbathing in? 
... 
(Shoot. I don't know how to keep the conversation going.) 
Arf, arf! 
Hey, 
[dog]! 
Arf, arf! 
Seems like [dog] wants to play with you, Reni. 
Arf! 
... 
Reni... 
Go play with Shiro. 
Go play with Hanamaru. 
Go play with Dai. 
Go play with Torte. 
Go play with Long. 
Go play with Altair. 
Go play with Hund. 
Do you dislike dogs? 
Reni, why not play with [dog] 
since he's here? 
It looks like he wants to play with you, too. 
Arf, arf! 
...I would prefer to avoid any excessive movement. 
Do you dislike dogs, Reni? 
Not particularly... 
Arf, arf! 
... 
Arf, arf! 
Reni, 
just look how much [dog] wants to play with you. 
You could at least give him a pat on the head. 
... 
Well, there is somewhere I must be... 
Ah, Reni! 
Shoot, too late. 
Whiiine... 
There there, 
[dog]. I'm sure Reni will come around eventually. 
Oh my, Ensign... 
Arf, arf! 
Hi, Sumire. 
Were you playing with [dog]? 
Yes. My family kept a dog once, when I was younger. 
Although he was quite a bit larger than this fellow, he made an excellent playmate. 
Well then, 
[dog]. Let us play again another time. 
Arf, arf! 
I wish Reni would play with you, too. 
I should get going, too. See you later, 
[dog]. 
Woof! 
Arf! 
Hey there, 
[dog]. How do you like the theater so far? 
Arf, arf! 
Hahaha. I wonder what you're saying? It's almost like you can understand me. 
Anyway, I should be off. See you later, 
[dog]. 
Woof! 
Hey, Sakura. 
Ah, Ogami. 
Hm? What happened to the summer dress you had on earlier? 
I'm just about to start my sword training, so I got changed. 
It turns out my usual traditional clothing is better at getting me in the right frame of mind for training. 
Hahaha... Yeah, I see what you mean. 
I know! Would you like to train with me, Ogami? 
Sure, let's do it! 
No thanks, sounds like a pain. 
Sure, let's do it! I ought to get some exercise in occasionally. 
Really? I'd appreciate it. 
OK, I'll teach you what to do as we go. Now, let's get started! 
I think I got some good training in thanks to you. Thank you so much, Ogami. 
I'm glad I could help out. 
I'm going to keep it up for a while longer. 
I see. In that case, I'll be on my way. 
You did great! 
Thank you so much for training with me today, Ogami. 
Sure. I'm glad I could help you out. 
I'm going to keep it up for a while longer. 
I see. In that case, I'll be on my way. 
You did great! 
S-Sorry... I guess I wasn't much help after all. 
No, it's fine. It's enough that you wanted to help me train in the first place. 
If you have the time, I'd be happy to train with you again another day. 
When that time comes, I promise I'll try a little harder. 
Sure! 
Well, I'm going to keep it up for a while longer. 
I see. In that case, I'll be on my way. 
You did great! 
No thanks, sounds like a pain. 
Is that so... Well, I'm going to keep it up for a while longer. 
I see. In that case, I'll be on my way. 
All right, we'll do this together, Ogami. 
I'll teach you what to do as we go. Now, let's get started! 
Looks like Sakura is still training with her sword. 
I don't want to get in her way, so I'll go somewhere else. 
Huh. Is that Sumire? 
Ah, Ensign. 
Hey, Sumire. What are you up to? 
Why, I was only recalling our performance of the summer production the other day. 
It has been far too long since I stood in the spotlight onstage... 
The thunder of applause from the audience ringing in my ears... There is no feeling quite like it. 
I feel as though I was born to be an actress... 
Being onstage is where I find my bliss... 
You're absolutely right. 
You were perfect for the role. 
Keep up the hard work. 
You're absolutely right. The way you returned to us and jumped right back onstage... 
And that scene you shared with Kanna... It was fantastic to see. I'd expect no less from you, Sumire. 
Hohoho... You understand me so well, Ensign. 
It's simply my talent at work. This is what a true star looks like! 
You really were perfect for the role of Goneril, if you ask me. 
The scene where you give Kanna's King Lear a hard time felt so true to life! 
Excuse me? Are you saying that was anything less than my acting on display? 
Gah... N-No, that's not what I... 
Besides, the part was the only thing I was unsatisfied with. 
Why was I not given the lead role? It's beyond my understanding! 
What a terrible shame for those fans who loyally awaited my return. 
R-Right... 
Keep up the hard work. I'll be in the crowd, cheering you on. 
My, Ensign. Such kind words, but they are unneeded. 
Talent like mine hardly requires such things as "hard work" or "effort." 
R-Right... 
In the first place, it's careless to believe our hard work only happens in front of the audience. 
I believe that hard work is something which happens behind the scenes, each and every day. 
I see... 
...You've gone rather quiet all of a sudden. Is there something the matter? 
Uh... I was just, um... Thinking of how to respond. 
You know, Ensign, it is important to keep pace in conversations. 
If you cannot hold a dialogue where you respond in a timely manner, you're not fit to converse with a lady. 
R-Right. Sorry. 
In any case, I'm really relieved to have you back with us again, Sumire. 
Goodness, I did tell you during our last correspondence that I would return shortly, didn't I? 
Besides, there is never truly a dull moment here at the theater. 
Sumire... 
I should be on my way, as it is time for me to take my tea. 
Have a lovely day, Ensign. 
She may have brushed it off, but I'm sure she must be happy to be back, too. 
Well... I ought to get going, myself. 
There's no one onstage. It doesn't look like rehearsal has begun yet. 
Oh well. Guess I'll go someplace else. 
Oh, Ogami. Do you need something? 
You came here to listen to my gossip, right, Ogami? 
It's nice to see you again, Ogami. 
I'm all out of rumors at the moment. Sorry! 
I see, that's too bad. 
I'll have some more interesting tidbits for you another time, so look forward to it! 
Hey, Yuri and Kasumi. 
Oh, hello, Ogami. Is there something you need? 
I've got plenty of new, juicy gossip for you. Ask away! 
Hello there, Ogami! Would you like to buy something? 
Buy a photo. 
Talk to Tsubaki. 
Leave. 
Could I buy a photo? 
Sorry, Ogami. I can only sell one photo at a time. 
Please understand, we need to keep some for the customers. 
You'd like to buy a photo? Thank you very much! 
That's a photo of Sakura. 
Let's see... Sakura's photo, right? 
That'll be 50 sen. Thank you very much! 
That's a photo of Sumire. 
Let's see... Sumire's photo, right? 
That'll be 50 sen. Thank you very much! 
That's a photo of Maria. 
Let's see... Maria's photo, right? 
That'll be 50 sen. Thank you very much! 
That's a photo of Kanna. 
Let's see... Kanna's photo, right? 
That'll be 50 sen. Thank you very much! 
That's a photo of Iris. 
Let's see... Iris's photo, right? 
That'll be 50 sen. Thank you very much! 
That's a photo of Kohran. 
Let's see... Kohran's photo, right? 
That'll be 50 sen. Thank you very much! 
That's Orihime's photo, isn't it? 
Well... It's Orihime's photo, isn't it? 
That'll be 50 sen. Thank you very much! 
It's Reni's photo. 
OK, Reni's photo, is it? 
That'll be 50 sen. Thank you very much! 
Oh, you're not going to buy it? 
Oh yeah, you brought back that super cute little doggy earlier, didn't you? 
I guess he lives here at the theater with us now, huh? 
Oh, right! His name was [dog], 
if I remember. 
Cute little [dog]! What a great name! 
Would it be OK if I played with him after I'm done working? 
Yeah, of course. I bet he'll really take a liking to you, Tsubaki. 
Ooh, I can't wait to play with [dog]! 
Well, I should be going. Keep up the good work. 
Thanks very much! Come back again soon! 
Thank you very much! Come back and buy another photo next month! 
Hmm, it looks like the door to the manager's office was left open. 
Is someone inside? 
Oh, Saki, it's you. What're you doing in here? 
Ogami... 
I thought I would organize some of these documents while Mr. Yoneda is gone. 
But never mind that. You know, we're completely alone in here right now... 
So... kiss me. 
Eep!! Wh-What?! 
Please, hurry. 
Kiss her. 
Run away. 
Kiss her. 
Run away. 
Scold her. 
O-OK then, if you want me to, then... 
Ogami... 
... 
(...Huh? I don't feel anything.) 
...Saki? 
Hmmhmm, you were being serious, then? Oh, Ogami, you're so adorable. 
Huh? Saki, where'd you go? 
Umm... I think she just pulled a fast one on me. 
Tch, forget it. No point in sticking around here, so I'm gonna leave. 
S-Sorry! I've... got to go! 
Ogami! 
Phew. I wonder if I ran far enough? 
Still, why in the world would she suddenly up and ask me something like that? 
Saki, do you have any idea what you're asking me?! 
Begging me to kiss you in the manager's office while he's in the hospital... It's completely shameless! 
Oh dear, you're even cute when you're angry. 
Don't take things so seriously! Isn't that what Yoneda himself always says? So come now, hurry... 
I can't deal with this any longer. Excuse me! 
Good grief. I wonder if I got far enough away. 
But anyway, why in the world would she suddenly up and ask me something like that? 
Hmmhmm, scared, aren't you? Then I'll start us off... 
(It... It would be really bad if anyone saw this!) 
S-Sorry! I've... got to go! 
Ogami! 
Phew. I wonder if I ran far enough? 
Still, why in the world would she suddenly up and ask me something like that? 
Saki is gone. I'm not sure whether to be relieved or disappointed... 
OK, enough of these stupid thoughts, Ogami. Time to go somewhere else. 
Hi, Orihime. 
... 
I have not a thing to say to you, Ensign! Please excuse me! 
Oh man... She certainly was angry with me. 
Oh well. Guess I'll head elsewhere. 
Oh Ensign, it's you. 
What're you doing in here? 
I am relaxing and stretching out my legs for a moment. 
This "tatami" had me surprised at first, but I have come to like it very much. 
You've gotten accustomed to it, then? 
And you were so skeptical of it before... 
I guess you've steadily gotten accustomed to life here, then? 
I'm a bit relieved to see that. There's nothing better than being at ease where you live. 
This theater IS a little cramped, but also rather cozy at the same time. 
And you were so skeptical of it being made of grass before... 
I think anyone would be surprised to hear that the floor is made of grass! 
Hahaha, I was just teasing you. 
When I heard it was grass, my first thought was whether there were bugs inside of it... 
I didn't imagine it would feel this nice on your feet. 
In any case, I'm happy to hear you like the tatami. 
Yes, though that is not the case with Japanese men. 
I will be going now, if you please. 
Oh, come on... I guess nothing's changed on that front. 
This has basically become the "party room" as of late... 
But thankfully, it's back to being used for its original purpose because of the King Lear performances. 
Hi, Orihime. 
Oh, Ensign. As always, you seem to have very much free time on your hands. 
I-I guess. Anyway, are you practicing the piano? 
It is not practice. I am training my creativity. 
Discerning one sound from another, technical skill, concentration, and creativity... 
All of these I believe are skills that carry over from music to the battlefield. 
So that's it. That line of thinking feels very like you, Orihime. 
Say, now! Why don't we have a test of your skills by playing for just a bit? 
How do you think, Ensign? Shall we try? 
Sure, let's do it. 
Haha...There's no way I can do that. 
Sure, let's do it. 
Well, do try your hardest not to embarrass yourself! 
Haha...There's no way I can do that. I don't have any ear for music at all. 
Yes, I've no doubt your abilities here amount to much at all. 
But will the Flower Division's captain really be so quick to turn tail and run from a challenge? 
Uh... 
I suppose you can go and waste as much time as you'd like. 
Unlike you, I have places where I must be. So I will excuse myself now. 
With Orihime gone, I guess I've got the room to myself. 
What do you say, then? Will you do it or not? 
...All right. I'll give it a shot. 
Ooh...don't blame me if this turns out to be too much for you. 
Well, do try your hardest not to embarrass yourself! 
My, my... A surprisingly good showing, Ensign. 
Hahaha... I wouldn't go that far. 
I think this is what they call "beginner's luck" or "happy accident", isn't it? 
I suppose it was a perfect way to kill some time. 
Unlike you, I have places where I must be. So I will excuse myself now. 
With Orihime gone, I guess I've got the room to myself. 
Hmm... I feel like I could have tried a little harder. 
I expected nothing less than mediocrity from you, Ensign. 
From that standpoint at least, it was quite impressive. 
Ugh... 
But still, I suppose it was a perfect way to kill some time. 
Unlike you, I have places where I must be. So I will excuse myself now. 
With Orihime gone, I guess I've got the room to myself. 
I did not expect much of you, but I never imagined you would do quite this badly... 
To be frank, it is a wonder to me that you've served as Flower Division captain this long. 
W-Was I really that bad? 
Coming this far with as little sense as you have is an accomplishment all its own. 
Well, at the very least, watching you was an amusing way to kill the time. 
I will be on my way now. 
Unlike you, I have places where I must be. So I will excuse myself now. 
With Orihime gone, I guess I've got the room to myself. 
Yep, Orihime's not here anymore. 
She said she was headed somewhere else, so maybe I should go, too. 
Nobody's here. Time to try another room. 
Heya, Boss. 
Hey, Kanna. Hmm... Something smells pretty good. 
Heheheh, I'm whipping up Chef Kanna's Ultra-Special Menu! 
It's bitter melon chanpuru, a dish we make where I'm from back on Okinawa. 
You just stir-fry some bitter melon with eggs. 
Sounds pretty tasty, right?! 
It sure does! 
Not to me... 
It sure does! I bet it's nice and refreshing in the summer heat, too. 
That's my Boss! I knew you'd get it! 
All right, here ya go, Boss-man. Eat up! 
I'm still in the middle of makin' it, but I should be finished up by around 3:30. 
Come back to the cafeteria in 30 minutes or so, and I'll feed you as much as you can eat! 
OK, thanks Kanna. I'll come back in a bit, then. 
Come back hungry, ya hear? 
I don't know... Bitter melon doesn't sound all that tasty to me. 
So that's how you respond when someone goes outta their way to tell you how good something tastes? 
Guess there's no accountin' for taste... 
S-Sorry. 
Why not try it out, just for the heck of it? 
I'm still in the middle of makin' it, but I should be finished up by around 3:30. 
Come back to the cafeteria in 30 minutes or so, and I'll feed you as much as you can eat! 
A-All right. I may swing back around if I feel so inclined. 
You may as well give it a taste! I'll be here! 
Hmm, I can't decide if that would taste good or not... 
Oh yeah...? All right, I'm gonna serve you some, Boss. 
I'm still in the middle of makin' it, but I should be finished up by around 3:30. 
Come back to the cafeteria in 30 minutes or so, and I'll feed you as much as you can eat! 
OK, thanks Kanna. I'll come back in a bit, then. 
Yeah, you better be ready for it! I promise it'll be great. 
Hey, Boss. I'm still makin' that chanpuru right now. 
I think it'll be done in about 30 minutes, so come back here then. 
Come back around 3:30, got it. 
Yep! I'm sure that'll give your stomach enough time to make some room. 
Man, it smells really good. 
...I can smell it as much as I want, but that won't make it cook any faster. I better go. 
Man, it smells really good. 
This must be the scent of Kanna's bitter melon chanpuru. 
...I can smell it as much as I want, but that won't make it cook any faster. I better go. 
Yo, Boss! 
Hey Kanna. I'm back and ready to eat, just like you told me. 
Heheh, thanks for waitin'. Take a seat. 
Hi Kanna. Are you eating right now? 
Yep. This is Chef Kanna's Ultra-Special Menu. 
It's bitter melon chanpuru, a dish we make where I'm from back on Okinawa. 
You just stir-fry some bitter melon with eggs. Sounds pretty tasty, right?! 
You can have some too, if you want. Go on, take a seat! 
Well, since you're offering... OK then. 
Here ya go, Boss. Help yourself. 
Sure thing. Thanks for the meal. 
...Wow, this is great! I could eat bowlfuls of this! 
Heheh, I knew you'd be into it! Man, I never get tired of watchin' you eat. 
Say, Boss. How's about you an' me have a little eating contest? 
The rules are simple: whichever of us can eat three servings of food the fastest is the winner! 
Sounds fun. I'll take that challenge! 
Bitter melon chanpuru 
Rice 
Tea 
All right, here we go! Ready...start! 
OK... What should I grab first? 
Mm, bitter melon stir-fried with eggs...so tasty. 
Pretty great, huh? This recipe is my specialty! 
*munch* *munch*... The seasoning is fantastic! 
And the rice is steamed to perfection, too. *munch* *munch* 
*munch* *gulp* Phew...need to catch my breath...Okay, onto the next one! 
Which one should I eat? Hmm, this is tough... 
What're you doing, Boss? Better get to eating unless you want me to come out on top. 
OK, I finished the first serving. What do you think, Kanna? 
Hey, not bad. But you've still got some food left. Start shovelin' it in! 
OK, onto meal two! 
Bitter melon chanpuru... 
Rice... 
Tea... 
Bitter melon chanpuru...it was good at first, but I'm starting to get tired of it. 
*munch* *gulp* Okay! Managed to get it down! 
The rice isn't as easy to wolf down as it was the first time, either... 
*chomp* Ugh...there, that should be all of it. 
Phew...I feel a little better after washing it down with some tea. 
But I've still got food left to eat. Sigh...this is wearing me down. 
Is it just me, or... I can't seem to move my chopsticks like before. 
What's wrong, Boss? Ready to give up? 
Man...I-I think two servings is my limit. 
Hey, not bad! I didn't even think you'd eat this much! 
Kanna...you're completely unruffled by this, huh? 
Damn...I've come this far, I can't give up now! 
B... Bitter... 
Ri... ce... 
Tea... Tea... 
Urgh... C'mon, Ogami... Just a little more... 
*munch*... 
*munch*... 
*chew*... 
Th-There! I finished off all the chanpuru! 
Just one more bite... Gotta eat all... the rice... 
Hey, wait, you OK? You're lookin' a bit green around the gills! 
Y-Yeah, just fine... Look, just one bite... left... 
Phewww! That's the last of the rice eaten! 
Ugh...my stomach's not doing too great right now... 
...Hraaah! Time to drain this in one gulp! 
Glub... Glub... Glub! 
Haah! And that's all the tea! 
Huff... Huff... 
Hey, Boss, you OK!? You can stop any time, man. 
Heheheh... I'm doing just fine... Just taking a quick break... 
There! I ate absolutely everything! And... I was faster than you, Kanna! 
Heheheh... But the victory still goes to me. 
Huh? But wait, you're still eating, aren't you? 
I'm eating six servings, Boss. 
Wh...what? Are you serious?! 
...I admit defeat. There's no way in hell I can match up to you, Kanna. 
There! Three servings, polished off! 
Whaaa? You ate it all already?! 
Heheh, eating this amount was child's play. 
You were so close, too...but you did great to scarf down as much as you did! 
So you couldn't quite finish 3 servings...and here I thought you could go a little farther. 
What the heck, Boss? You ate way less than I figured you could. 
Kanna...just how on earth can you eat this much food?! 
Well...good food is easy to eat. I guess that's my secret? 
Gah...That's not a secret at all! 
Hey Boss, your stomach doin' okay? 
Yeah...I think I'll pull through. 
In any case...you're something special all right, Kanna. 
Speak for yourself! I bet if you pushed a little harder, you could eat even more! 
But I guess the victory goes to me this time around! 
I feel like my stomach's gotten a bit bigger after all that eating. 
Well, I should get going...but my body feels...kinda heavy... 
All the tableware from our eating contest earlier have been put neatly away. 
Kanna is just incredible. She ate all that food and still managed to clean up afterwards. 
We're between performances, so there aren't any patrons here. 
None of the Flower Division members are here, either. I should head elsewhere. 
If I recall, Maria is scheduled to return this month. 
We haven't heard from her, but...this is Maria we're talking about, so I'm sure she's fine. 
We're not doing a performance this month, so there aren't any patrons around. 
There's really no point in being here. I'll go somewhere else. 
Everyone who saw King Lear looked pretty happy with it. 
Turns out it wasn't a bad idea at all to make such a drastic change to the story. 
Still, it was a zoo in here last month when it came time for the play. 
I could barely keep up when it came to punching tickets. I'd better get some practice in... 
King Lear was such a hit last summer, it was standing room only. 
I hope our fall performance does just as well... 
Looks like no one's here. Where did everyone go? 
Nobody here...looks like they're taking a day off from rehearsal. 
Guess I should head to another room, anyway. 
Come to think of it, Sakura's the one in charge of cleaning around here. 
Every nook and cranny is cleaned to a shine. That's Sakura for you. 
It can't be easy organizing all these costumes, either. They have to be aired out on occasion to keep bugs at bay... 
There really are a whole lot of costumes here, though...Just how many do we have? 
No one's here. I guess this room doesn't see much use outside of performances. 
Guess I should head to another room, anyway. 
When Mr. Yoneda was still here, we had a lot of VIP patrons coming through. 
Nobody's around. I'll go somewhere else. 
It's empty. No one usually comes here during their free time. 
Oh well. Guess I'll check someplace else. 
There doesn't seem to be anyone on the terrace. 
Since the rain's finally stopped... 
...maybe I'll go to the courtyard and visit [dog]. 
I figured I'd check again, but there's still no one here... 
Oh yeah, Kohran was asking for me, wasn't she? I'd best not be late. 
... 
(It looks like Orihime is back.) 
(I wonder what she's always doing here?) 
Mamma... 
Hm? 
Mamma, it has been 3 months now since I came here to Japan. 
At first, I thought that it would be a terrible place... 
...because this is where HE was born, after all. 
But I am starting to feel that, just maybe...it is not so bad after all. 
My captain may be a busybody, but the theater is a fairly comfortable place to stay. 
In the beginning, I wanted to run back home as soon as I could...but I have decided to stay a little longer. 
I hope you are well, Mamma. I'm just fine, so you take care of yourself... 
(Orihime...) 
Say something. 
...I should leave her be. 
Orihime... 
...! 
E-Ensign! Just how long have you been there?! 
S-sorry...I didn't mean to eavesdrop. 
You certainly do love to eavesdrop, don't you?! Just like usual! 
Japanese men are all sneaky little cowards, after all! 
I do not wish to see your face any longer! Now, get out of my way! 
Wait, Orihime... 
Well, eavesdropping isn't exactly something to be commended for. Guess there's nothing else I can say. 
(...I should leave her be. It wouldn't be right to bother her.) 
(Still, I never expected to see this side of Orihime...) 
Well now, I should be on my way. 
(Oh, shoot! I gotta get out of here!) 
Oh, Ensign. Whatever could you be doing here? 
I-I could ask you the same thing. 
Oh, me? I need to have a quick word with you. 
Though I am thinking you have no idea what you're talking about. 
Now if you will pardon me. Please, enjoy yourself! 
Orihime...so that's what you're always doing here. 
Huh? I thought Orihime was here, but... 
Maybe I'll come back later... 
There's no one in the attic. Not like anyone would come up here, though. 
Oh well. I'll go try another room. 
Oh, hey there, Iris. 
Ah, Mon Frere! 
What are you up to? Searching for a book? 
Um...Miss Kaede gave me a workbook, so I'm studying. 
But the problems are all in Japanese, so I came to get a dictionary to look up the words I don't know. 
Is that so? You're amazing, Iris. 
Mon Frere...I get kind of...sleepy whenever I study. 
Hahaha...keep it up, Iris. Studying is important. 
...Yeah. Okay, I'm gonna keep studying for a little longer. 
Iris is studying...maybe I should drop in on her room to see how she's doing. 
Nobody's here. 
I'll try somewhere else. Maybe where everyone else seems to be going... 
Iris... Is she inside? 
So Iris's nameplate is shaped like Jean-Paul... 
I better check another room, I guess. 
It's Ogami. Are you there, Iris? 
Yes, I am. 
I'm studying right now. But it's so hard, it's making my head hurt... 
Mind if I help you? 
Really? You'd help me out? 
Sure. Though I don't know how much help I'll really be. 
Then come on in! Yaaay, Mon Frere is gonna study with me! 
Welcome to my room! 
Thanks. By the way, what are you studying? 
Today, I'm learning some new Japanese words. 
Language studies, then? That does seem like it'd be a bit tough for you. 
I'll be okay! I have you helping me, after all! 
Hahaha...I hope I live up to your expectations. 
Let's get started, then. 
Yeah! 
Hmm... 
Hey Mon Frere, what's a "three-legged race"? 
How does two people equal three legs? Shouldn't they have four? 
Well, you see... 
Demonstrate with your legs. 
Draw a picture. 
Use an allegory. 
Hmm, I think it may be easier to show you. 
...Huh? Hey, whatcha doing? 
Let's see, if I wrap this string around my right leg and your left leg... 
There. If you combine both of our legs together like this, it makes a single leg. 
Wooow, you're right! There's two of us, but we have three legs! 
When people try to race this way, it's called a three-legged race. 
We also use the term in Japanese to mean when two people work together towards a common goal. 
Hmm...I'll draw you a picture. 
Okay, here we have two people. 
Hey, Mon Frere...what is this? 
Huh? It's supposed to be a person... 
Kyahaha! It kinda looks like a monkey! 
A-a monkey? But I tried so hard to draw this... 
Ah, never mind. If you tie two of their legs together, it creates one leg. 
Wow! So two monkeys' legs put together becomes one leg! 
I get it! When two people work together, it's the same as a three-legged race! 
W-well, yes, but...um, are you sure you understand it correctly? 
Well now...let's say you have an old man and woman. 
There's a huge carrot growing in their field out back, but neither one of them can pull it out alone. 
So if the two of them work together and give it a good, hard yank, they can harvest it. 
Oh, I see! So a three-legged race means when you need to harvest carrots, you should do it with two people! 
Umm, that's not quite what it means, but I guess that is the general idea... 
Hmm, could a three-legged race be like when two people work together on something...? 
Yes! That's exactly right, Iris! Nicely done. 
Hee hee. I got it right! Hooray! 
Hey Mon Frere, let's keep doing more! 
All right then. On the the next problem! 
Mon Frere...I can't keep going. I'm too sleepy... 
Just one more, Iris. Come on, keep your head up! 
Let's do it later, okay...? 
Just push through it! 
Guess we should stop. 
Just push through it! One more problem. Come on, Iris! 
...Okay, okay. You're so strict, Mon Frere. 
I guess we should stop, then. We'll finish the rest later. 
Yaaay! All done, all done! 
You have to do it properly! 
You didn't answer, so I decided I'm finished! 
Good grief...I guess there's no point in pushing it, so we might as well leave off there. 
Well, looks like you're done studying for today. Nice job, Iris. 
Uh-huh! Thanks, Mon Frère! 
Leave the room. 
Praise her. 
Give her homework. 
I'll head off, then. See you later. 
Let's study again another time! 
Phew...I'm actually kind of tired. 
I am doing this for Iris, though. I should keep checking in on her every now and then. 
You worked really hard today, Iris. You did fantastic. 
Really? Cause it was so much fun studying with you! 
Let's study again another time! 
Hahaha, I see. Okay, I'll be off for now. 
Phew...I'm actually kind of tired. 
I am doing this for Iris, though. I should keep checking in on her every now and then. 
All right, here's your homework. Finish up to this page by next time. 
Huh?! Mon Frere, you're awful! 
It's important to do a little more each and every day. Understand? 
Oookaaay. Aww, I hate this... 
Phew...I'm actually kind of tired. 
I am doing this for Iris, though. I should keep checking in on her every now and then. 
Iris...looks like you're drifting off again. 
I should be going. See you later, Iris. 
Okay...goodnight. 
Phew...I'm actually kind of tired. 
I am doing this for Iris, though. I should keep checking in on her every now and then. 
Iris... Is she inside? 
So Iris's nameplate is shaped like Jean-Paul... 
I better check another room, I guess. 
Snoooore... Snooore... 
Hahaha, I see she's taking a nap. All that studying earlier must've tired her out. 
Iris... Is she inside? 
So Iris's nameplate is shaped like Jean-Paul... 
I better check another room, I guess. 
Snoooore... Snooore... 
Iris... Is she inside? 
So Iris's nameplate is shaped like Jean-Paul... 
I better check another room, I guess. 
It doesn't seem like Iris is in there. 
Why Ensign, is that you? 
Hi there, Sumire. Having some tea? 
Indeed. And the tea we have here is exceptional. Today I am drinking what's called Russian tea. 
In order to make it, you must add a certain ingredient to black tea. Would you happen to know what it is? 
Sugar? 
Salt? 
Soy sauce? 
Milk? 
Jam? 
Butter? 
Um...sugar?

Salt, maybe?

Russian tea is black tea flavored with jam.

This is Kaede's room. 
I better check another room, I guess. 
It's Ogami. Are you there, Kaede? 
Oh, Ogami? Just a moment. 
Come on in. 
Sorry to drop by unannounced. 
I've never seen you wear that outfit before, but it really suits you. 
Oh my, thank you. 
Untranslated
Untranslated
Um... I thought, if you wanted, maybe we could chat for a bit... 
That sounds perfect. I've been wanting to speak with you, as well. 
Come on in, then. No need to be modest. 
C-Certainly. Pardon me. 
Wow... So this is your room, Kaede? 
Untranslated
I'm sure it must have a completely different atmosphere from my sister's room, right? 
Yes. Ayame's room had a very Japanese feel to it. 
Hahaha, that sounds about right. She was always one to prefer a more Japanese style... 
But as for myself, I like Western designs. Even though we're sisters, we were quite different. 
By the way, what did you wish to discuss, Ogami? 
Oh, um... Would it be all right if I asked you something? 
What is it? I'll answer if I can. 
Untranslated
Haha, you want to know that? 
Let me turn the question around. Why did you join the Imperial Assault Troupe, Ogami? 
To ensure peace in the capital. 
I was assigned to it.

All right. Well, I should get going. Please excuse me. 
I'm glad I had a chance to speak with Kaede. Maybe I'll make an effort to drop by and see her sometimes. 
This is Kaede's room. 
I better check another room, I guess. 
It's Ogami. Are you there, Kaede? 
Oh, Ogami. 
I'm sorry, but I still have reports to write. 
I see. Then I'll see you in another time. 
Sorry, Ogami. Let's sit down and chat some other time. 
Now, what should I do... 
Make a call. 
Maybe next time. 
OK, I'll make a call. 
I'll call someone another time. Maybe I'll head somewhere else for now. 
There's no one here... Where did everyone go? 
Maybe they're spending time with [dog]? Hmm... I'll try somewhere else. 
The sunlight here is so bright. It's nice and warm. 
Well, I guess I'll keep going since there's nobody here. 
The other day, Yuri told me that these VIP seats are 15 yen per ticket... 
Still, the fact that these seats are always filled just shows how popular the Flower Division is. 
No one's here. I'll try somewhere else. 
Billiards and darts, huh? I seem to remember Kayama being pretty skilled at these. 
Heh...this really takes me back to my days at the Naval Academy. 
Come to think of it, I've never spent any time in here before. 
I'd like to try playing billiards with someone. 
If I recall, Maria is supposed to return this month. 
Come back soon, Maria... 
It's Maria's nameplate. 
There's no reason to hang around since Maria's gone. I'll go somewhere else. 
I wonder if Reni's here. 
Nope, not here. 
It's just a piece of paper from a notebook. I suppose that's fitting for someone like Reni. 
OK, let's check another room. 
I wonder if Sakura's in her room? 
Too bad, she's not here. 
It's just like Sakura to have a cute nameplate like this. 
Let's go check another room. 
I wonder if Kanna is inside. 
...She's not here. 
A nametag hangs on the door, almost as if it's standing guard over Kanna's room in her absence. 
OK, let's check another room. 
I wonder if Sumire is inside. 
Nope, not here. 
This is a pretty subtle design, considering it's Sumire. 
Let's check another room. 
I wonder if Orihime is in her room? 
Seems she's not in. 
The nameplate has a simple design, but it sure looks high class. 
Let's go check another room. 
I wonder just what Kohran wants to speak with me about. 
We promised to meet at 4. It's a little early still. 
A gear-shaped nameplate, huh? It's just Kohran's style. 
Maybe I'll come back after I've wandered around a bit more. 
Huh? Looks like someone's in the bathroom. 
That looks like...the summer dress that Sakura was wearing... 
Wh-Which means right now, Sakura is in there. 
My body is moving towards the bathroom on its own... 
Go back outside. 
Oh no, my body is moving towards the bathroom on its own... 
Ahh, this feels great... So refreshing after getting soaked by the rain. 
And I'm so happy Ogami said I looked good in that dress... 
(Sakura...) 
(C-Crap!) 
...! I-is someone there?! 
Make an excuse. 
Run away. 
Make an excuse. 
S-Sakura...I can explain, really. 
O-Ogami!! 
Eeeeeek! Get out of here! 
Um, but I just- 
I don't care, just get out! Now! 
R-right! 
... 
Sorry for just bumbling inside like that, Sakura... 
I guess it's fine since you really didn't mean to... 
...but please be more careful from now on. 
Yeah...I really shouldn't have done that. 
(I gotta get out of here before she sees me!) 
Phew... I think I got away before she realized I was there. 
If I'd been just a moment slower, I might not have made it. That was too close. 
Eeeek! O-Ogami?! 
(Crap! No use in running now!) 
Eeeeeek! Get out of here! 
Sorry! Leaving now! 
... 
Sorry for just bumbling inside like that, Sakura... 
I guess it's fine since you really didn't mean to... 
...but please be more careful from now on. 
Now if you'll excuse me, I need to do my sword training. 
Yeah...I really shouldn't have done that. 
(I've gotta get out of here before Sakura finds me.) 
Phew... Looks like she didn't see me. 
I can't be peeping in the baths like this. I'd better stop here. 
Ahh, I feel brand-new... I guess I'd better get out. 
(Oh, crap!! It looks like she's getting out of the water!) 
(I gotta get out of here before she sees me!) 
Phew... I think I got away before she realized I was there. 
If I'd been just a moment slower, I might not have made it. That was too close. 
Oh, Ogami. Are you here to bathe? 
N-No... That's not it. 
You know, you did get pretty wet in the rain earlier. 
Why not take a bath to warm up so you don't catch a cold? 
G-good idea. Thanks, Sakura. 
I'd better be going. See you later. 
Yeah...a bath doesn't sound too bad. 
Get in the bath. 
Go somewhere else. 
OK, I think I will take a bath. 
I don't have time to lounge in here all day... But a short, relaxing bath would be nice. 
Phew... Ohh, this feels great. 
The injury I got from rescuing [dog] is even starting to hurt less. 
Having this huge bath to soak in all to myself is seriously heaven on earth... 
Now that I'm nice and warmed up, I guess it's time to get out. 
Ahh... That was a nice bath. 
15 minutes went by before I even realized. 
I might've lazed around for just a bit too long, though. OK, time to go. 
I don't really have time to keep relaxing. I should head somewhere else. 
A bath, huh? I guess I did get caught in a downpour on the way to the hospital. 
Wouldn't hurt to warm myself up a little. 
Get in the bath. 
Go somewhere else. 
All right, I'll hop in the bath. 
I don't have time to lounge in here all day... But a short, relaxing bath would be nice. 
Phew... Ohh, this feels great. 
The injury I got from rescuing [dog] is even starting to hurt less. 
Having this huge bath to soak in all to myself is seriously heaven on earth... 
Now that I'm nice and warmed up, I guess it's time to get out. 
Ahh... That was a nice bath. 
15 minutes went by before I even realized. 
I might've lazed around for just a bit too long, though. OK, time to go. 
I don't really have time to keep relaxing. I should head somewhere else. 
Looks like there's no one here. 
I took a bath already, so there's no need for me to be here. 
Heya, Chief. What're you up to way over here? 
I could ask you the same thing. 
Who, me? Just running an analysis on some materials for my next big invention. 
Just as I'd expect from you. 
What kind of invention? 
Just as I'd expect from you. 
What was that secret project of yours? 
Just as I'd expect from you. 
What kind of invention? 
Just as I'd expect from you, Kohran. You barely made it through the front door before starting on your next invention. 
Ahh Chief, you can't just whisper sweet nothings at me like that!

So, what kind of invention is it? 
Heheheh...sorry, but that's my little secret. 
You'll get to see it soon enough, so keep your eyes peeled! 
Oh right, I just remembered! What exactly was that secret project you were working on? 
Oop...w-well, uh... Dang it, your memory's too good, Chief.

...? Got some deep thoughts rattling around in there, Chief? 
No... I just feel bad for coming here and disturbing your work. 
No need to tiptoe around me, you know. It's nothing world-shattering, after all. 
Hokay, analysis complete! I'd better make like a tree and leave. 
Sure. Best of luck with your invention. 
Thank you kindly. I'll see you in my room at 4, and don't be late! 
A new invention, huh? What in the world could it be? 
Well, I'm sure she'll show it to me sooner or later. I ought to get going, too. 
The heat from the steam processor make this room hotter than other rooms. 
Crap, I'm sweating. What am I doing here when it's this hot out, anyway? 
Whoa! R-Reni! Why are you naked?! 
I'm swimming. 
Reni... 
Sorry, I'm leaving right now! 
Put on a swimsuit! 
Sorry, I'm leaving right now! 
Put on a swimsuit! 
Sorry, I'm leaving right now! 
Put on a swimsuit! 
...Maybe I'll swim, too. 
S-sorry! I'm leaving right now! 
... 
Please excuse me! 
Huff... Huff... I thought my heart was gonna pop out of my chest. 
Still though...somehow, it doesn't surprise me all that much to see Reni swimming naked. 
R-Reni, put on a swimsuit! 
...a swimsuit? 
Swimming without clothing is more efficient, as it reduces the drag from the water. 
That may be, but swimming naked while other people are around is asking for trouble! 
So unless you wanna cause a scene, you need to wear a swimsuit! 
...Understood. I will do so from now on. 
Y-you get it, right? Then I'm leaving now! 
Huff...huff... I thought my heart was gonna pop out of my chest. 
Still though...somehow, it doesn't surprise me all that much to see Reni swimming without a swimsuit. 
...Maybe I'll swim, too. Want to swim together, Reni? 
I'm done swimming, now. 
I-I see...oh well. 
I guess I'll be going, then. See you, Reni. 
Oh man. I wish I hadn't put my foot in my mouth. 
Still though...somehow, it doesn't surprise me all that much to see Reni swimming naked. 
Did you need something? 
N-no, I...was just taken aback... 
Listen Reni, you really ought to wear something when you go swimming. 
Swimming without clothing is more efficient, as it reduces the drag from the water. 
That may be, but swimming naked while other people are around is asking for trouble! 
So unless you wanna cause a scene, you need to wear a swimsuit!

Huff...huff... I thought my heart was gonna pop out of my chest. 
Still though...somehow, it doesn't surprise me all that much to see Reni swimming naked. 
Hey, Reni. Getting some swim practice in? 
... 
Wait...are you naked? 
I know it feels nice to swim naked, but you ought to at least wear some swim shorts. 
Swimming without clothing is more efficient, as it reduces the drag from the water. 
Maybe so, but it could cause trouble if one of the female troop members saw you this way. 
... 
Come to think of it... I've always thought your body seemed pretty feminine, Reni. 
Looking at your chest now, it seems rounded enough that you might have b... 
...b-b-breasts?! 
R-Reni...are you...a g-girl? 
...Yes. 
Wh-Whaaaaaaaatttt!? 
Leave immediately. 
Shut your eyes. 
I-I'm sorry! I just barged in here without knowing that you're female... 
It's fine. No need to apologize. 
There are still some functional differences between male and female. 
A-Anyway, I'm leaving right now. Sorry for barging in!! 
Huff...huff... I thought my heart was gonna pop out of my chest. 
But still... To think that Reni is a girl... Hmm... 
I suppose she never did specifically say that she was a boy... 
But still, how did a girl her age learn combat techniques like that? 
R-Reni! I closed my eyes, so I didn't see anything! 
OK... I'm leaving right away. 
Yeeeowch! Damn, who put a wall here? 
The door is a bit more to your right. 
Th-thanks. And, erm...sorry, Reni. 
Huff...huff... I thought my heart was gonna pop out of my chest. 
But still... To think that Reni is a girl... Hmm... 
I suppose she never did specifically say that she was a boy... 
But still, how did a girl her age learn combat techniques like that? 
I'm done swimming. The pool is all yours. 
O-oh no, I wasn't... 
A-Anyway, I'm leaving right now. Sorry for barging in!! 
Huff...huff... I thought my heart was gonna pop out of my chest. 
But still... To think that Reni is a girl... Hmm... 
How did a girl her age learn so much about combat and warfare? 
I don't think she would tell me, even if I asked her... Just one mystery after another with her. 
Reni... 
I'm done changing. I'll be on my way. 
I've done this not just once, but twice now... I'm sorry, Reni. 
It's fine. 
I will be sure to wear a swimsuit from now on. 
I wouldn't wish to cause a scene. 
I-I think that's for the best, yeah. 
I'll be on my way. 
Sigh... Same as ever, I see. 
Why am I just standing around here, anyway? I'd better get going, too. 
... 
Reni... 
Sorry about earlier. 
So you're a girl. 
Sorry about earlier. 
It's cute when you put it that way. 
I'm sorry about the earlier. I didn't realize that you're... a girl. 
It's fine. 
Um... I suppose you'd prefer I kept this a secret from the others? 
I don't mind if you tell them. It's all the same to me. 
One's biological sex makes no difference in battle. 
Reni... 
Well, I was just...surprised to learn that you're a girl. 
No one ever asked, so I never mentioned it. 
One's biological sex makes no difference in battle. 
Reni... 
It's kind of cute when you put it that way. 
Cute? 
Is that... a good thing? 
Y-Yeah... I was trying to praise you, here. 
OK, I'll take that as a good thing. 
So Reni is a girl, huh... 
I don't know how should I say this... but somehow, I'm happy. 
If you got nothing to say, I'm leaving. 
Ah, R-Reni! 
I should've just come out and apologized to her. 
No one's here. I wouldn't mind a dip in the pool myself, since summertime is here. 
I don't have my swimsuit on me, so maybe next time. 
Oh, Chief. 
Hey Kohran. Come to check on the koubu?

Tell me some gossip. 
I'll come back later. 
Seems like you started to keep a dog in the courtyard, Ogami. 
You're right. Sorry I didn't ask your thoughts about it before. 
Oh, not at all! So, that dog's name is <name> 
isn't it? 
Quick of getting info as usual, Yuri. 
Ufufu. Actually, Kohran just drop here and tell us about it. She was really happy about it. 
Well, great to that. 
I hope you guys can come play with him sometimes. 
Has Manager Yoneda been doing OK? 
Yeah. We just visited him in the hospital, and he was already lively. 
He's not allowed to drink sake while in there, so it must have been a good chance for his body to heal too. 
Well, it's the manager we're talking about. There's a chance that he secretly drinking too. 
I heard from Kanna that recently some foods in the kitchen have gone! 
Huh!? D-Don't tell me there are rats? 
Maybe not. Those foods are gone along with its bag, too. 
Don't you think that there's someone we don't know who might live in here too? 
Just kidding. Doesn't it frightens you? 
Oh right, Ogami, have you ever been to Café Paulista before? 
Eh, Cafe... What was it? No, I haven't. 
They have delicious coffee and donuts! 
It's a wonderful cafe, many authors and playwrights visited there frequentlty. 
Whenever I go there, I got a little tired for hearing difficult conversations though. 
By the way, I heard that there are some female bus conductors these days! 
It's cool to see working women among men. 
I admire them for a bit. 
Now that we're talking about it, you're working among women too, right? 
By the way, Maria is scheduled to return soon, isn't she? 
Huh, is that so? Having her return is a relief for me. 
You look happy to hear that, Ogami. Were you lonely because Maria is away? 
I-It's not like that. I'm just happy that I got another comrade in Flower Division that she'll return soon. 
It's quite hard for me to keep an eye on every member by myself. 
I see. It does seems really hard to keep everyone together by yourself. 
That reminds me, recently people say that they saw a person with a guitar in here. 
Sometimes there's even sounds of guitar and someone's singing too. 
Apparently they not seem to be from the theater's orchestra. 
If their identity is revealed, I'll you right away. 
O-OK... Thanks. 
Speaking of which, Summer break is coming on next month, isn't it? 
I'm thinking of buying a brand new swimsuit and go to the beach! How about we're going together, Kasumi? 
Uh? I think I'll pass... Anyway, do you have any plans for Summer break, Ogami? 
Uh... Our job doesn't have any day off, let alone Summer break.. 
Sorry Ogami, but I'm all out of gossip for now. 
I'll have some more interesting tidbits for you another time, so look forward to it! 
Oh, Ogami, have you bought Maria's photo? 
Since she's in America, I thought that at least I can get her photo, so... 
How about I tell you Maria's call number, Ogami? 
I-Is it OK? 
She already gave me her number in case of emergency. 
but you can talk to her if you call to, "13900." 
13900", isn't it? OK, Yuri. Thanks! 
I'll be back. Good luck with your work. 
OK. Thanks for today, Ogami. 
Tell me if you got some new gossips! 
Sorry Ogami, but each customer is only allowed to purchase one photo at a time. 
I see. That's too bad... 
My apologies Ogami, but each customer is only allowed to purchase one photo at a time. 
Oh, really? That's too bad...

Ayame and I almost never had a chance to live together, even though we're sister. 
Eh...? 
That's not so unusual. Our family tree is more like a wisteria with the way we're connected. 
But I always had a feeling that would sacrifice herself at any time, 
and carrying all the burdens by herself. 
When I heard the news that she's gone, I had a thought that I want to carry her will. 
I want to protect the peace that we have in Tokyo just like her. 
And for my own sake, too. 
That's all from me. 
You know, I came here to work by my own will. 
To protect the peace in here, and to cherish our audience's smile. 
Don't you feel the same, Ogami? 
Of course I feel the same. 
So let's do our best together. 
For my sister... And for everyone. 
Yes! 
Well, today I will tell you about the Anti-Kouma Corps. 
Anti-Kouma Corps of the Army is the predecessor of The Imperial Assault Troop. 
Ikki Yoneda, Kazuma Shinguji, Shinnosuke Yamazaki, and... Ayame Fujieda. 
The special force were formed by only those four to defend the capital from Kouma. 
Seven years ago... A kouma appeared in Nihonbashi. 
Even though it was just a single kouma, military and police were powerless againts it. 
However, Anti-Kouma Force sacrified themselves and managed to seal the Kouma. 
This incident has made the government realized that it's important to prevent evil forces, and took up the problem. 
Thus, the Imperial Assault Troop, where we belong now, was born. 
The Imperial Assault Troop is fruit of Anti-Kouma Force's will. 
And among the Anti-Kouma Force, only Lt. General Yoneda is alive now. 
Those four who protected people from evil... We have keep carry out their will. 
... 
Well, I'll tell you the story about Ayame's travel. 
In order to recruit members of the Flower Division, Ayame traveled around the world. 
She searched for girls with high spiritual power, which will suitable to join the Flower Divison, 
and sent letters to many countries. America, France, China... 
Whenever she does it, to be honest, I envied her. 
I see, so she did all that... 
That's how she gathered the members, and formed Flower Division like now. 
So, Ogami. These days, I've been thinking like this, 
Ayame made a right decision when she chose people who would become a part of Flower Divison, including you. 
Kaede... 
Ayame has entrusted Flower Division to me, so I'll also continue to give it my all. 
Don't give yourself in, even when hard time comes, Ogami. 
Roger! I will do my utmost to meet your expectation! 
Now I'm going to tell you the story about Ayame and Mayor Yamazaki. 
Both Ayame and Mayor Yamazaki are members of the Imperial Assault Troupe predecessor, The Anti-Kouma Corps. 
Mayor Yamazaki was also a notorious scientist who made the basic design of the Spirit Armor. 
I heard that he also had a strong sense of justice than most people. 
Ayame and Mayor Yamazaki were in love with each other. 
But their relation got tore off when The Great Kouma War happened. 
What could have caused that? 
This is only a guess, but... 
it seems that during their fights with kouma, he became obsessed with his own idea. 
What is "devil?" Why does it exist? 
And why does it have so much power? 
Manager Yoneda noticed that Mayor Yamazaki has changed, and he warned him many times, 
but none of those warnings could change his mind, 
not even Ayame's words. 
When the battle with Kouma seven years ago was came to its end, Mayor Yamazaki was missing. 
In our recent fight, he appeared again, but as The Cerulean Satan. 
Justice by "power", rule by "devil"... 
perhaps that was his conclusion... 
I wonder if Cerulean Satan, or rather, Mayor Yamazaki would tell us his thoughts, 
back when he appeared in front of the theater six months ago. 
...
