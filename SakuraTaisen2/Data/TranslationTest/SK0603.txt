...I'm coming in. 
Sorry for barging in like this. I was just worried about what happened during your rehearsal. 
... 
Are you not feeling well? 
... 
Reni? 
Captain... 
...Reni? 
What... What am I... What am I fighting for? 
Huh? 
I... I don't know what I'm fighting for anymore. 
Captain... What is it that YOU'RE fighting for? 
Well, you see... 
To protect the capital. 
For justice. 
To protect the capital. 
For justice. 
To find the blue bird of happiness. 
I'm fighting to protect the capital. That's our duty as the Imperial Assault Troupe. 
The capital... has nothing to do with me. 
Huh?! 
For justice, of course. 
...Justice? 
That's right. We defeat evil and represent our justice. That's our job. 
Justice through destroying evil. An ideal stained in blood... Is that why you fight? 
Reni... 
Heh, isn't it obvious? It's to find to the blue bird. 
Now, let's look for the blue bird of happiness, together! 
J-Just kidding! Ha, hahaha... Are you feeling better yet? 
...I guess not. 
Hmmm... That's a tough question. 
I haven't ever seriously thought about why it is that I fight. 
...I see. 
... 
...Get out. 
Huh? 
I'm going to bed. 
B-But... 
Just go already! 
Reni... 
... 
What am I fighting for? 
What am I... fighting for? Hmm... 
Ah, what a joy this is... Yo, Ogami! 
That voice, is that...? 
I knew it, it WAS you! What are you even doing?! 
Hey, Ogami. What a lovely night it is... 
I like to hang upside-down like this when it's dark out. 
What are you, a bat?! 
Hmm, a bat, huh? 
Yes, I am but a lone bat, flapping through the night... 
...Whatever, just get in here. 
Hmph, very well. Alley-oop! 
By the way, Ogami, would you say you hold any beliefs? 
Wh-What's all this, out of the blue? 
There's an old saying: "Faith can move mountains." 
Don't speak with words. Don't think with logic. Your answer lies elsewhere. 
You understand, Ogami? 
I see. It's true, I was having trouble putting my answer to Reni into words... 
What Reni needs isn't words or logic. It's my honest feelings. 
You must not falter, Ogami. To falter would be to play into the enemy's hands. You must stay true to your beliefs. 
Yeah, got it. I appreciate the advice. 
I'd expect nothing less from my rival. I'll see you later, Ogami. Alley-OOP! 
There we go... Well then, Ogami, farewell! Adiòs! Till we meet again! 
...Seriously, what's with that guy? 
Mon Frèèère! Are you in there? 
Oh, it's Iris this time. Come in, door's open. 
OK, I'm coming in! 
Hey, Iris, what's up? 
Guess what, Mon Frère? I made this for Reni! 
A flower crown? 
I see, so this is what you were up to in the yard this afternoon. 
Uh-huh! I thought Reni looked kinda sad. 
If I give her this flower crown as a present, I'm sure she'll cheer right up! 
You put your heart into that flower crown, Iris. I'm sure it'll cheer her up. 
And and and! I was hoping you'd come with me to give it to her. Will you? 
Sure, let's go. 
I don't feel like it. 
I want a flower crown, too. 
Sure, let's go. I'm a little worried about Reni, myself. 
Yaaay! Thanks, Mon Frère! 
Right, then, shall we go? 
I don't feel like it. 
Huh? But why? 
Iris... Could you make me a flower crown, too? 
Huh? Sure, but you have to do something for me first. 
All right, sure, what is it? 
You have to come to Reni's room with me! 
Haha, guess I don't have a choice. Got it, let's go. 
Yaaay! Thanks, Mon Frère! 
Right, then, shall we go? 
... 
What's wrong, Mon Frère? Don't you wanna come with me? 
No, that's not it, I was just thinking about what to say. 
I actually went to see her earlier, but she kicked me out of her room. 
Heehee, then why don't you come with me and you can patch things up? 
B-But I... 
C'mon, hurry! Let's go, Mon Frère! 
Iris, w-wait! You don't have to pull on me, I'm coming! 
... 
Hm? What's wrong, Iris? 
Mon Frère... Do you think Reni will like it? 
It's all right. I'm sure she will. 
...OK! 
Reni? Are you there? 
...Did you need something? 
Uh-huh, but I'm not telling you what until you open this doooor! 
...What is it? 
Teehee! Here you go! It's a present from me to you! 
What is this? 
A flower crown I made just for you! It's pretty, right? 
Iris... Why did you do this for me? 
Because you're my friend, Reni! 
And when my friends are feeling sad, I'm always there to cheer them up! 
I'm... your friend? 
Reni, Iris poured her heart into making that flower crown. 
... 
We might not know what exactly it is that's bothering you... 
But we'll always be by your side, watching over you. This flower crown is proof of that. 
... 
So... You'll take it, right, Reni? 
Yeah... Thank... Thank you, Iris. 
Ah! Mon Frère, look! Reni smiled! 
Yeah. Isn't that great, Iris? 
Yeah! 
All right, Reni, it's getting late. Get a good night's sleep, OK? 
...OK. Good night. 
Well, Iris, we should head back to our own rooms too. 
Uh-huh! Thanks for your help, Mon Frère! OK, good night! 
Yeah. Good night, Iris. 
Hm hm hm... 
Looks like the rats are finally starting to catch on... Now's my chance. 
Flowers... Iris is... my friend? 
Hm hm hm... A false friend, that is. 
Who's there?! 
Saki? 
Reni, you're just like me, you know. 
Wha... What are you doing? 
There's no such thing as friends you can trust. The only one you can rely on in the battlefield... is yourself. 
I'm sure you know that very well, don't you, Reni? 
I... I... 
You've always been completely, utterly alone... But there's nothing to worry about. 
In the heat of battle, everyone is alone. 
Ah... 
Now, come with me. 
You're just a machine, born only to fight. You don't need any friends. 
...!! 
 
Hm hm hm hm hm... 
Our master will be thrilled to have you. 
Imperial Assault Troupe... Your comrade, Reni, now belongs to me, Saki Kageyama... 
Or rather, Suiko of the Black Demon Society! 
Hm hm hm hm hm...
