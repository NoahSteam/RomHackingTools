What great weather today, a nice and sunny spring day. 
Our spring production is over, and the Imperial Theater's on break. Now, what should I do today...? 
(Hm? Who could that be?) 
Yes, coming! 
Well if it isn't Sakura. Did you need something? 
Yes. I have a favor to ask you, Ogami. 
If it's all right with you, could you meet me by the entrance later? 
A favor? What could that possibly be? 
Heehee, it's a secret. All right, I'll be waiting! 
Meet her by the entrance, huh? Could she be asking me out on a date? 
I guess I ought to head down to the entrance. 
Well if it isn't Sumire. Did you need something? 
Ensign, are you available right now? 
Yeah, I'm open. 
There's something I'd like your help with. 
Would you mind coming to the salon later? 
All right, sure. What is it you need help with? 
You can look forward to learning that once you come to the salon. Until then, good day. 
What could it be? <br> Hmm, now I'm curious. 
OK, guess I'll head over to the salon. 
Hey, Maria. What's up? 
Captain, um... Are you free right now? 
Yeah, sure, but... What's up? 
You remember how we went to Yokohama, right? 
Yeah, I remember. <br> We went together for New Year's. 
Back then our trip was interrupted by the Black Demons and we were forced to come back early. 
So, um... This wouldn't exactly be a do-over, but... 
If it's all right with you... Would you like to go to Yokohama with me again? 
Yeah, sure. <br> I'd be glad to. 
Really? Thank you. 
I'll wait for you over by the entrance. Until then. 
A date with Maria in Yokohama, huh? Can't wait. 
Right, guess I should head over to the entrance. 
Yo, Boss. 
Hey, Kanna. Need something? 
Well... You got a minute? 
If you're free, you wanna come with me to the beach? 
The beach? It's a little early in the year to go swimming, isn't it? 
We wouldn't be swimming, but... Well... I just wanna go look at the ocean with you. 
Heheh, I know this ain't really like me. 
So, Boss... Wanna go? 
Yeah, sure. <br> I'd be glad to. 
Really? <br> Thanks, Boss! 
All right, I'll be waiting over by the entrance. See ya later! 
A beach trip with Kanna, huh? Can't wait. 
OK, guess I'll head over to the entrance, then. 
Heheheh, hey Mon Frère! 
Hey, Iris. Did you need something? 
Uh-huh! Let's go on a date, Mon Frère, right now! 
You promised we'd go on a date after we got back, remember? 
Hahaha, now that you mention it, I guess I did. 
Sure, let's go. I'd be more than happy to. 
Yaaaaaay! Thanks, Mon Frère! 
Leave the itinerary to me! 
Really? All right then, go ahead. 
Come to my room once you're ready, OK? 
All right, see you later! Bye-byyye! 
A date with Iris, huh? Hmmm, where does she plan on taking me? 
OK, guess I'll head over to her room. 
Hey Chief, ya free right now? 
Hey Kohran. Did you need something? 
Well, you know how I used to work at the Hanayashiki Branch, right? 
Yeah, I know. 
There's a munitions factory underground below the Hanayashiki Branch... 
But on the surface, it's a theme park that the general public can come and visit. 
Chief... Would you wanna go there with me? 
Kohran... 
Sure, I'd be more than happy to. 
For real?! <br> Thanks a bunch, Chief! 
All right, just swing by my room when you're ready to go! I'll be waiting! 
An amusement park date with Kohran, huh? Can't wait. 
OK, guess I'll head over to Kohran's room, then. 
Ciao, Ensign. 
Hey, Orihime. Did you need something? 
Actually, Ensign, there's something I wanted to show you. 
Come by my room later, please! 
Something to show me? 
Heehee, whatever could it be? 
OK then, I'll be waiting! 
Something to show me, huh? I wonder what it is. 
All right, guess I'll head over to Orihime's room, then. 
Hey, Reni. Did you need something? 
Captain... Are you free right now? 
Yeah, I'm open. 
There's... a festival nearby today. 
So... 
... 
Reni... 
We could go together, if you want. 
Yeah... Thanks, Captain. 
OK then, come to my room later. I'll be on standby. 
On standby, huh? Hahaha, some things never change with her. 
OK, guess I ought to head over to Reni's room. 
Ahh... What nice weather. 
The spring breeze is so refreshing. 
Ogamiiii! 
Hey, Sakura. Is that...? 
Yes, it's a bicycle. I was hoping we could ride it together. 
I see... So that's what this was all about. 
I figured we might be going somewhere, since you wanted to meet by the entrance. 
Ever since that battle, I've been thinking about how much I wanted to go out on a date. 
I thought we could go to a fancy restaurant or shop at a high-end boutique or something... 
But during that battle... We were together the whole time... And it made me realize something. 
I'm happy just being with you, Ogami. 
... 
I want to be with you just the way I always am, without trying to impress you. 
I want to treasure every moment I get to spend with you. 
Sakura... 
OK, Ogami, let's get going. 
Now, could you please hold the back of the bike up for me? 
Huh?! W-Wait, then... That favor of yours... 
That's right! I want you to help me practice. 
Heh, I only just bought this bike, I don't actually know how to ride it yet. 
S-Say what?! 
Thanks for offering to teach me! Now, full steam aheeead! 
Whoa! S-Sakura, waaaaait! 
Oops, I don't think this outfit's gonna cut it for a date. 
Better get changed while I'm at it. 
There, that should do it. Let's go. 
Hey, Maria. Did I keep you waiting? 
No, you're all right. We have plenty of time. 
Now, how about we take a steam taxi over to Yokohama? 
Sure, let's do that. 
Here you go, Maria. 
Thank you. 
Why don't we go see the ocean at night? 
The view is bound to be lovely. 
I see. Can't wait. 
This marks the second time we'll have visited the ocean in Yokohama. 
I feel like we'll be able to make some new memories today. 
Memories by the ocean, huh? 
That reminds me of how we were stuck in that cave in Atami during our summer vacation. 
Yes... That's another memory I'll never be able to forget. 
Well, I don't think you'll have to worry about swimming this time around. 
Captain, please, don't tease me like that! 
Hahaha. Sorry, sorry. 
Driver, I'm ready to go now. 
W-Wait a second, Maria, don't leave me here! 
Hm hm hm, I'm just kidding, Captain. 
After all, nothing makes me happier than being with you. 
Yo, Boss! You came! 
Of course I did. Right, so which beach are we going to? 
I was thinking 'bout going to the beach over in Shonan. 
Shonan? Sounds good. 
Heheh, so, uh... Does this count as a date? 
I'm getting a little embarrassed... 
Kanna... 
R-Right, let's get goin'! Race you to Shonan! 
Whoa, wait, Kanna! <br> Are we running all the way to Shonan?! 
Wh-Whoops. <br> Force of habit. <br> Guess I'm a little nervous... 
Hahaha, the train's just arrived, so how about we ride it there instead. 
Woohoo! <br> Look, Boss, the ocean! <br> I can see the ocean! 
You're right. Ah, the smell of the ocean sure brings me back... 
I've always loved looking at the ocean, ever since I was a kid. 
I always thought about going to the beach with you once the fighting was all over. 
Kanna... 
Whenever I look at the ocean... It makes me feel brave. 
It gives me the courage to take on anything, with everything I've got. 
... 
I wanted to see the ocean so I could feel brave enough to... Um... Tell you how I, uh... 
What is it, Kanna? 
Heheh, nope, still can't do it! Too embarrassed to say it! 
All right, Boss, race you to the water! 
C'mon, Kanna, tell me, I wanna know now! 
C'mon, better start running or you're gonna get left behind! Hahahaha! 
The spring sunlight's pouring into the theater. 
Looks we're gonna have great weather all day today. 
Orihime often plays piano here. 
What is it that she wants to show me, anyway? 
Hey, is that you, Orihime? 
Ciao, Ensign. <br> Did you come to listen to me play piano? 
No, that's not why I'm here. 
Aww, that's a little disappointing. 
I've come up with all sorts of music ideas ever since we got back from our last battle. 
I have to work my hardest so I don't lose out to Papa! 
Hahaha, I see. 
All right, Orihime, I'm gonna go now. 
Stay a while and listen to me play next time, OK? 
(Orihime's playing piano.) 
(I'll leave her be. Wouldn't want to disturb her.) 
Mr. Yoneda. Drinking as usual, eh? 
That you, Ogami? Wanna drink? 
N-No, I'm good. 
Aw, you're no fun. 
Still, you did great in that last battle. 
And now... Kazuma can truly rest in peace. 
...Yes, sir. 
Everyone put their lives on the line to defend this city... 
So you better keep defendin' it, no slackin' off! Hahahaha! 
...Yes, sir. 
Mr. Yoneda. <br> It's Ogami... 
Zzzzzzzz... Zzzzzzzz... 
Sounds like the manager's fallen asleep. 
That makes sense, what with all his drinking and this warm weather. 
Ah, hello, Ogami! 
Hello, you two. Hard at work, I see. 
Yes, our clerical work's really piled up, thanks to that battle... 
We've been working overtime constantly since then, it's been tough! 
I see. Keep up the good work, you two. 
Roger! Yuri Sakakibara, ready to get back to work! 
Oops, slipped into Mikasa mode for a second, there. 
Hahaha... 
Hm hm hm, oh, Yuri. 
OK, I'm gonna get going now. Good luck, you two. 
OK. Thanks for everything, Ogami. 
Come back to help us out sometime! 
Oh, Ogami. Back so soon? 
Looks like you've got lots of free time. 
I know! Maybe you could help us sort the receipts? 
N-No, I've got plans, I don't have the time. 
What sort of plans? 
W-Well, that's, uh... 
I smell a scoop! You'll have to tell me all about it, Ogami! 
N-No can do! I have to go. 
Ah! Ogami, waaaait! 
Ah, Ogami! So, what were those plans of yours? 
N-Nothing in particular... 
Sheesh... Now I have to know. 
N-Now, now, you don't have to worry about me. 
Anyway, looks like you two have a lot of work to do, but good luck! 
OK. Thanks you. 
Come back and tell me if you change your mind, OK, Ogami? 
Spring has come, and the trees in the courtyard are full and green again. 
My second spring since coming back to the Imperial Theater... How time flies. 
... 
Oh, is that you, Reni? 
...Captain. 
What are you doing out here? 
I was just... looking at the theater. 
Standing here, looking at it... It makes me feel calm. 
This... is where I belong. 
Reni... 
I'm going to stay here a little longer. 
OK, I'll be going, then. See you later, Reni. 
(Reni's still in the courtyard.) 
(She must be savoring the joy she feels from being back at the theater.) 
I guess not even Kanna would eat before going out. 
A beach trip with Kanna, huh? Can't wait. 
Yo, Boss. Here to eat? 
Hahaha, nope. I see you're eating like you always do, though. 
Yeah, the food here really is great! 
OK, onto bowl number eleven! 
N-Number eleven?! 
You want some, Boss? 
N-No thanks, I'm good. <br> Enjoy your food. 
Gotcha. <br> Later, boss! 
Oh, Boss. You're back. 
Let me know whenever you get hungry. 
I'm always ready to whip up some good food for ya. 
Thanks, Kanna. 
See you later. I'll be counting on you once I feel hungry. 
Yeah, I gotcha covered! <br> Later, Boss! 
Ah, Ogami! Good afternoon! 
Tsubomi? What are you doing by the stage? 
Ah, right. I just wanted to take one last look at the Imperial Theater's stage before I go. 
I'll be going back to the Maidens' Academy. 
Everyone there wants me to tell them about that last battle! 
I see... So I guess this means goodbye. 
Good luck with everything. 
Yes, sir! Thank you so much for taking care of me this whole time, Ogami. 
I'll work hard and smile-smile until I can stand on top of this stage one day! 
Oh, I almost forgot! Could I please get a handshake, Ogami? 
Yeah, sure... 
EEEEK! I got to shake hands with the Captain Ogami of the Flower Division! Everyone's gonna be so jealous! 
Thank you so much! And... goodbye! 
Good luck out there, Tsubomi. 
Did Tsubomi already leave for the Maidens' Academy? 
Tsubomi may fail at a lot of things, but if I know her like I think I do... 
Then I know the day will come when she'll be able to stand on this stage. 
Ah, Ogami! Welcome! 
Working hard, Tsubaki? 
Yes! I do work here, after all. 
Aren't you tired from working during the spring production right after that battle? 
Whatever exhaustion I feel gets blown away when I see my customers' smiling faces! 
You did a good job, too, Ogami! 
Hahaha, thanks. 
All right, keep up the good work. See you later, Tsubaki. 
Thank you, come again! 
Ah, welcome, Ogami! 
Could I get a photo, Tsubaki? 
Sorry, Ogami. We're replacing all the photos for new ones right now. 
You'll have to wait until the new ones come in. 
I see... Oh well, then. 
All right, I'll stop by some other time. Keep up the good work, Tsubaki. 
OK, thank you! Come again! 
Even the VIP entrance was buzzing with guests during our spring production. 
I'm glad Minister Yamaguchi and Count Hanakoji were able to come see it. 
We made so many onigiri to hand out during the play. 
Iris caused quite the scene with her chocolate onigiri. 
The costumes for our spring production were a big hit with the crowds. 
The stage here will be livened up with all kinds of costumes for years to come, I'm sure. 
Once we finally wrapped the spring production, we partied in this room straight until dawn. 
Everyone was pumped up from having worked so hard to make this production a success. 
It's so quiet now that the play's over, feels like all that hustle and bustle was just a dream. 
Now that it's over, I almost feel a little nostalgic for how nervous I felt. 
The Flower Division may be on break for now... 
But soon they'll be turning that stage into a wonderful dreamland once again. 
That reminds me, it was here that I first ran into Kayama at the theater, huh? 
I had no idea he was the captain of the Moon Division back then, though. 
After having sold so many tickets for the spring production... 
I feel like this past year's made me better at ticket punching. 
Hey, Sakura. 
Oh, Ogami. 
I just got back from my sword training. 
I see. You sure work hard, Sakura. 
Well, I do need to train a lot more if I ever hope to catch up to my father. 
All right, Ogami, I'll be going now. See you later. 
Sakura's really trying her best. 
I know she'll be able to surpass her father someday. 
Oh, Ogami. Did you need something? 
No, nothing in particular. 
Oh, I see. I was writing my reports just now. 
You did a fantastic job, Ogami. What's more... 
You kept your promise to me. You came back, alive. 
Yes, ma'am. 
Every single member of the Flower Division made it back, together... 
And it's all because of you, Ogami. Thank you so much. 
Kaede... 
Now then, you'd better get going. After all, you've got someone waiting for you, don't you? 
Huh?! <br> But... How did you know? 
Hm hm hm, I'm the deputy commander, remember? All right, run along now. 
Um... It's Ogami. 
Oh, Ogami? Did you still need something? 
Don't waste too much time, or else a certain someone'll get fed up waiting for you. 
R-Right... 
Hm hm hm... Now, hurry up and get going. 
Yes, ma'am. Understood. 
This room fills me with so many memories... 
Like how whenever I was alone, I'd often get visited by-- 
Yo, Ogami! 
That voice... Kayama?! 
Haha, indeed! Alley OOP! 
Anyway, Ogami, this peace sure is lovely, isn't it? 
This peace we fight so hard to protect is truly, truly wonderful! 
Kayama... You didn't get hurt fighting the Kouma, did you? 
I told you I'd be fine. Don't underestimate the Moon Division! 
But hold on, Ogami... Does that mean you were worried about me? 
Well of course I was. We're both part of the Imperial Assault Troupe. We're partners, aren't we? 
Ogami... Thank you. What a joy it is to be able to fight at your side! 
However, there is an old saying: "Tighten your helmet strings in the hour of victory." 
As captains of the Flower and Moon Divisions, let's both strive to do our best! 
Yeah! 
Well then, farewell, Ogami! Alley OOP! 
Adiòs! <br> Till we meet again! 
Kayama's not here anymore. 
Eh, knowing him, I'm sure he'll pop up out of nowhere again at some point. 
Reni? It's Ogami. 
Captain? Can you wait a second? 
Yeah, sure. 
... 
...Reni? What's wrong? 
Sorry. I'm coming out now. 
Wow! That's a yukata, isn't it? 
Kaede picked this out for me when I told her about the festival. 
She told me I should wear this if I was going to go. 
I see. It looks great on you, Reni. 
Thank you. I've been eager to try it on. 
I used to think all clothes were the same to me. 
... 
But I realized that that's not true. 
When I put on the same Flower Division uniform as the others, I felt a strong sense of courage. 
And when I came home from the battle and put on my regular clothes... 
I felt so happy I could live together with everyone again. 
Reni... 
I wonder how wearing this yukata will make me feel... 
Reni? It's Ogami. 
... 
Hmm, doesn't seem like she's in. 
I wonder if Iris plans on going to a fancy restaurant or something... 
I should dress nicely, just in case. 
There, that should do it. 
Iris? It's Ogami. 
Ah, Mon Frère? Come in! 
OK, then. Excuse me... 
Wow, Mon Frère, you look so cool! 
I didn't know where we were going for our date, so I thought I'd play it safe. 
Heheh, I've also been thinking about what to wear this whole time! 
Hahaha, this whole time, huh? Sounds like you had your hands full. 
Well yeah, I've been looking forward to this date since forever! 
I've been looking forward to going on a date once the fighting was over for a long time! 
Mon Frère... I'm so happy the fighting's over. 
Iris... 
Heheh! OK, I'm gonna put this on and then we can go! 
This date's gonna go great, Mon Frère. 
Yeah, it definitely will. 
By the way, aren't you going to tell me where we're going? 
Well... That's! A! Secret! Heeheehee! 
Hey, Iris. Sorry to barge in. 
Ah, Mon Frère! Welcome! 
I was just writing a letter to my papa and mama. 
About our spring play, about our last battle... 
Heheh, I have so much to write about, I don't even know where to begin! 
Hahaha, I see. 
All right, then, Iris, I'll get out of your hair. Good luck with your letter. 
Thanks, Mon Frère! See you later! Bye-byyyye! 
Iris said she was writing a letter. 
I don't want to bother her, plus I've got someone waiting on me, so I'll just go. 
Kohran? It's Ogami. 
Oh, Chief? I've been waiting for ya! C'mon in. 
OK, then. Excuse me... 
I should be fine dressed like this if we're just going to an amusement park, right? 
Yep. Best to wear something a bit more flexible. 
After all, we're gonna go on one heck of a ride. 
One heck of a ride"? 
I designed it during my time at Hanayashiki, just for such an occasion. 
I call it... The Fun-derstrike! 
The... Fun-derstrike? 
That... sure sounds like one heck of a ride, all right. 
Now that the fighting's over, I'm gonna keep on inventing all sortsa stuff! 
I wanna make people happy with all the stuff I invent. 
I wanna see everyone's smiling faces. 
But most of all, I wanna see YOUR smiling face, Chief. 
Kohran... 
The Fun-derstrike might be a little intense for you the first time around... 
But it's a ton of fun, you'll be addicted once you get used to it! 
I see... Looking forward to it. 
By the way, Kohran, just asking to be sure, but... 
It's not going to explode, right? 
Hahahaha! Relax, Chief! Your safety is guaranteed! 
C'mon, let's get goin'! Next stop: Hanayashiki! 
Kohran? It's Ogami. 
... 
Huh? Doesn't look like Kohran's in her room. 
Orihime? It's Ogami. 
Is that you, Ensign? Please, come in. 
OK, then. Excuse me... 
So, Orihime, what is it you wanted to show me? 
Well, I don't know... Should I show it to you? No, maybe I shouldn't after all... 
O-Orihime... Don't tease me like that. 
Heehee, all right, I'll show you. 
Here it is! 
Is this... From back when... 
That's right! It's the portrait Papa drew at the Imperial Hotel on New Year's! 
You know, the one of us! 
I just received it from Papa yesterday. 
I see... So Ogata finally finished it. 
When he gave it to me, he said, "You came back alive after all..." 
I'm so happy I get to show you this picture." 
... 
Anyway, it's a wonderful portrait, as expected of my papa! 
Yeah... I feel kind of embarrassed looking at a painting of myself, though. 
Really? I've been staring at it all day and can't get enough. 
Looking at this painting brings back so many memories of you... 
Orihime... 
We'll always be together, just like in this portrait. 
Orihime? It's Ogami. 
... 
Hmmm, doesn't seem like she's in her room. 
Ensign. <br> I've been waiting for you. 
What did you need me for, Sumire? 
Ensign... Do you remember the promise you made aboard the Mikasa? 
You promised me you'd join me for a shopping trip once we got back from that battle. 
There's just so many dresses... I'd like to go buy them right away. 
I see, so that's what this is all about. 
If you want me to, then sure, I'd love to tag along. 
Ensign... My deepest thanks. 
I don't know how useful I'll be for helping you pick out dresses, though. 
Oh, that's not why you're coming along. 
You're going to help carry my things! Ohohohoho! 
Oh brother... I figured as much. 
... 
Actually... I couldn't care less about shopping. 
I'm perfectly happy just being able to spend time with you. 
Hm? Did you say something, Sumire? 
N-No, nothing at all! Ohohohoho! 
Now then, Ensign, shall we get going? 
My, Ensign. You seem busy as ever. 
And I see you're gracefully enjoying your tea, as usual. 
Indeed. There's nothing quite like a cup of tea after a hard day's work. 
Besides, I always feel the most at ease when I'm sitting right here and drinking my tea. 
Hahaha, I see. 
All right, I'll be going, then. 
Very well. Good day, Ensign. 
My, Ensign. Aimlessly wandering around as usual, I see. 
You should relax and enjoy a nice cup of tea every once in a while. 
Haha... Well, I suppose you're right. 
All right, I'll take you up on your offer sometime. 
It would be my pleasure. Come to the salon whenever you'd like. 
The sunlight's so warm... 
The day I came back to the Imperial Theater was also a warm spring day, wasn't it? 
It's almost been a whole year since then already... 
Oh, Captain. 
Hey, Maria. What were you doing? 
Oh, I was just... gazing at the streets. 
They're the same streets as always... The same view as always... 
But... It's perhaps the most relieving view I can imagine. 
Maria... 
I'll stay here for a little while longer. 
I see. All right, Maria, see you later. 
What's wrong, Captain? You keep coming to the terrace. 
Nothing, just kinda wound up here. 
Hm hm, I see. 
Captain, let's keep doing our best to defend this city. 
Yeah... 
We had our spring production right after the battle ended. We've sure been busy up till now. 
At least now I've got a little more free time, so maybe I'll kick back and read a book later. 
The sunlight's pouring in through the window. 
It's looking like a beautiful spring day today. 
Maria? It's Ogami. 
... 
Doesn't look like she's in. Oh well, I'll go somewhere else. 
Actually, wait, she said she would be waiting for me by the entrance, didn't she? 
Sakura, are you there? It's Ogami. 
... 
Doesn't look like she's in. Hmmm... Wonder where she's run off to? 
Actually, wait, she said she would be waiting for me by the entrance, didn't she? 
Kanna, are you there? 
... 
No answer. Guess she's not here. 
Sumire? It's Ogami. 
... 
Doesn't look like she's in her room. 
Even though the fighting's over, the Imperial Assault Troupe's work never ends. 
We've got to keep working together to keep putting on great plays. 
Arf, arf! 
Oh, that sounds like 
! 
You came to the theater in July of last year, right? 
Arf! 
A lot's happened in just half a year. 
Bet you never thought you'd ever be flying in the Mikasa, did you? 
Now you're a full-fledged part of the team, too. Keep up the good work. 
Arf, arf, arf! 
Huh? Did 
run off somewhere? 
Eh, I'm sure he's fine. He's probably running around in the theater somewhere. 
To think this theater can transform and become a part of the Mikasa... 
Hard to believe when you see an attic made of wood like this. 
It's thanks to the Koubu that we were able to seize victory. 
Thank you, Koubu. <br> You can rest now. 
Oh, well if it isn't the Chief. 
Kohran? <br> Still working on the Koubu even though the fight's over? 
Yep. <br> They need maintenance now more than ever, after a job like that. 
The Koubu and the Tenbu... <br> They all did great. 
Now they get to take a little break while they heal their wounds. 
I see, so they're on vacation for a little while. 
All right, Kohran, I'm gonna go. Keep up the good work. 
Thanks a bunch, Chief! See ya! 
I don't see Kohran anywhere. She must be under a Koubu, fixing it up. 
I wouldn't want to get in the way of her work, so I'll go somewhere else. 
Hello, everyone. 
Ensign Ogami! Fabulous work in that last battle! 
You managed to topple both Musashi and Kyogoku without a single casualty... Beautiful, simply beautiful! 
R-Right... Thank you. 
That's my Ichiro! I knew we could count on you! 
Now, let me give you a smooch as your reward! 
Waaaahhhh! H-Heeelp! 
So now... peace has... finally returned. 
But unfortunately... we have to say... goodbye... 
G-Goodbye? 
Yes. Now that Kyogoku is dead, we're to return to the army to help get it up and running again. 
Our time together was brief, but we are truly in your debt. 
I see... 
Let's both do what we can to protect the peace of this city. 
Ensign Ogami. Never forget the Rose Division, secret unit of love and beauty. 
Let's have our passionate smooch next time, Ichiro! 
Ogami... No matter how far apart we may be... we'll always be rooting for you. 
...Thank you. 
All right, everyone, take care! Goodbye! 
Let's go, everybody! 
Hooray, hooray, Ogami! <br> Hooray, hooray, Ogami! <br> Waaahhh! (I feel so emotional! Again!!) 
I'll take this chair, so if you could grab that one, Yokihiko. 
Ooooh, I can't carry something this big! 
What are you saying, Yokihiko? You of all people could carry that singlehandedly. 
Oh, Kotone, sir! How could you be so cruel to me when I'm grieving! 
(Looks like they're in the middle of moving out...) 
(Despite everything, I think I'm actually going to miss having them around.) 
During the coup d'etat attempt, the revolutionary army blasted through this wall. 
It's been several months since then, and now we finally have true peace. 
Even though the fighting's over, I've got to make sure to stay in shape. 
I'd better keep coming here to exercise every now and then. 
I remember coming in here and getting flustered at seeing other people bathing... 
It was pretty hectic, but looking back on it, it makes for some nice memories. 
I should swim in here on occasion and train my body. 
Both fighting and ticket punching require stamina. It's important to work hard every day. 
There's nothing like the feeling of a hot bath after coming back from a battle... 
It really drives home the fact that you're back at the theater. 
I'm so glad we didn't suffer any major casualties in that last battle. 
I'll have to keep trying my hardest to protect everyone in the Flower Division. 
We've had a lot of strategy meetings in this room, even aboard the Mikasa. 
Now that the fighting's over, I don't think we'll be using this room for a while. 
The fighting might be over, but the steam processor keeps on working, as always. 
We'll both need to keep working hard to protect the peace. 
Sorry, Ogami, but each customer is only allowed to purchase one photo at a time. 
I see. That's too bad.
