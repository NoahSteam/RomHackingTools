Right, I should get started on my night watch. 
It's cold out tonight, but I've got a job to do. 
(I should check everyone's rooms first.) 
(I wonder if Iris is asleep already?) 
Who is it? 
It's Ogami. Were you still up, Iris? 
Mon Frère... I can't sleep. Can you come in? 
I see... All right, I'll come in for a second. 
What's the matter, Iris? Why the long face? 
Well... Jean-Paul and I have been talking. 
We were wondering if I can even play the lead at all, since I'm so little... 
... 
*sigh* I wish I could grow up already... 
I'm no good for the lead right now. 
That's not true. 
Maybe that's a good thing. 
True, it might be a bit much. 
That's not true at all, Iris. 
There's nothing that says a child can't play the role of an adult. 
I know you'd give a pure, innocent performance. 
...You really think so, Mon Frère? 
I'm no playwright, so I can't say much, but that's what I really think. 
Mon Frère... 
Thank you, Mon Frère. Now I feel like I can do it! 
No matter what role I wind up with, I'll do my very best! 
Good. Break a leg, Iris. 
All right, I have to get back to my night watch. Good night, Iris. 
Good niiiight! 
Maybe that's actually a good thing. 
...Huh? 
Someone as small as you playing the role of an adult might be interesting, no? 
Besides, I know you'd give a pure, innocent performance. 
...You really think so, Mon Frère? 
I'm no playwright, so I can't say much, but that's what I really think. 
Mon Frère... 
Thank you, Mon Frère. Now I feel like I can do it! 
No matter what role I wind up with, I'll do my very best! 
Good. Break a leg, Iris. 
All right, I have to get back to my night watch. Good night, Iris. 
Good niiiight! 
True... This might be a bit too much for you. 
You think so too, huh? 
Everyone was telling me I could do it too... 
But it's still too hard for me. 
...I'm sorry, Mon Frère. I'm interrupting your night watch. 
No, it's all right, Iris. 
I might not be good enough now, but I'll keep on practicing... 
And when I grow up, I'll do my best to get the lead role! 
I see... That's great, Iris. 
All right, I have to get back to my night watch. Good night, Iris. 
OK. Good night, Mon Frère. 
Sorry, Iris. As the person picking the lead, there's nothing I can tell you. 
Ah, that's right... Sorry, Mon Frère. 
I'm sorry I couldn't be of any help... 
It's OK. I'll be fine. 
Just talking to you cheered me up a little. 
I see... 
All right, I should get back to my night watch. Good night, Iris. 
OK. Good night, Mon Frère. 
Nothing unusual in the salon. 
I should take a peek in the game room while I'm at it. 
... 
Oh, if it isn't Sumire. 
...! E-Ensign?! 
What are you doing in a place like this? 
W-Well... I was just listening to a record. 
I was thinking of how I'm going to portray the lead role while I was listening to it. 
I see... That sounds about right for you, Sumire. 
... 
... 
Sumire... Aren't you going to listen to it? 
Ah... Y-Yes, that's right. 
... 
Sumire? 
Ensign... Could I ask you something? 
What is it? 
Am I... going to play the lead in "The Miracle Bells"? 
That's the plan. 
I'm still thinking it over. 
...I can't say. 
I... 
Ah! Wait! 
Don't tell me after all, not right now... 
Sumire... 
I... I'd love to play the lead... 
But I don't think I'm ready to. 
I'm... scared to hear your answer. 
Sumire... 
I think I'll be ready to hear it tomorrow. 
Well then, I'll be taking my leave. 
Good night, Sumire. 
Good night, Ensign. Good luck with your night watch. 
... 
Right, back to my night watch. 
I'm still thinking it over. 
I see... 
You're really thinking hard about this, aren't you, Ensign. 
If you're putting this much thought into it... 
Then I know it'll be a wonderful play. 
... 
I'm looking forward to your answer tomorrow. 
Thanks, Sumire. 
Of course, I can promise you that I'll put on the greatest show you've ever seen if you pick me. 
Well then, I'll be taking my leave. Good night, Ensign. 
All right, good night, Sumire. 
Right, back to my night watch. 
I can't tell you, not until tomorrow. 
Y-You're right. What's gotten into me? 
I'll just have to look forward to your answer tomorrow. 
Well then, I'll be taking my leave. Good night, Ensign. 
All right, good night, Sumire. 
I promise you, Ensign, that I'll put on the greatest show you've ever seen if you pick me. 
Sumire... 
Sorry, Sumire. As the person picking the lead, there's nothing I can tell you. 
Y-You're right. What's gotten into me? 
I shall wait until tomorrow, with my heart pounding all the while. 
Well then, I'll be taking my leave. Good night, Ensign. 
All right, good night, Sumire. 
I promise you, Ensign, that I'll put on the greatest show you've ever seen if you pick me. 
Sumire... 
Nothing unusual in the hall... 
Oh, right, I should check the terrace, too. 
Oh... Captain. 
Maria? What are you doing here? 
Apologies, sir. I was reading this script and got caught up in it. 
I completely lost track of what time it was. 
Hahaha, how passionate of you. 
So much has happened this past year... 
This will be the final performance to cap the year off. 
... 
A special performance where I get to spend Christmas Eve with you... 
I want to make this play a success... No matter what. 
Maria... 
It's all right, it's going to be a success. 
This is a big responsibility for me, huh? 
You should get some sleep. 
It's all right, Maria. It's going to be a success. I know the audience will recognize your feelings. 
Sir... Thank you. 
Now come on, you'll catch a cold if you stay out here. Let's get back inside. 
Yes, sir. 
Let's make the Christmas play a hit, Captain. 
Yeah. Let's do this, Maria. 
Yes, sir. 
This is a big responsibility for me, huh? I have to pick who's going to lead in such an important play... 
It'll be all right, Captain. Everyone in the Flower Division has their own unique skills and character. 
They'll all put on a wonderful performance that I'm sure will meet your expectations. 
All that will be left is for you to give them a little push. 
... 
All right then, sir, I'll be heading back to my room. 
OK. Good night, Maria. 
Good night, Captain. Good luck with your night watch. 
OK, let's continue with the night watch. 
I know exactly how you feel, Maria, but you should call it a night. 
Besides, it's freezing out here, you should head back inside. 
Yes, you're exactly right. Let's get back inside. 
All right then, sir, I'll be heading back to my room. 
OK. Good night, Maria. 
Good night, Captain. Good luck with your night watch. 
OK, let's continue with the night watch. 
I'm being allowed to help out with the play this time. 
So I want this to be a success just as much as you do, Maria. 
Right. Do your best, sir. 
Yeah. Thanks, Maria. 
All right then, sir, I'll be heading back to my room. 
OK. Good night, Maria. 
Good night, Captain. Good luck with your night watch. 
OK, let's continue with the night watch. 
OK, where to next? 
Hm? Seems like someone's out in the yard. 
... 
Is that you, Reni? What are you doing standing around in a place like this? 
Captain? 
I just felt like moving around all of a sudden... So I came here. 
Captain... If you don't mind, could you watch me dance? 
Sure, no problem. 
Watch you... dance? 
I'm in the middle of my night watch... 
Sure, no problem. 
Thank you. All right... Here I go. 
Hah! 
(Whoa...) 
(Reni's always so quiet, I never imagined she could dance with such passion.) 
Did you know... There's a god of the stage? 
...A god? 
That's right. Whenever an actor surpasses a certain level with their dance or performance... 
The god smiles as he watches them perform. 
So I'm going to give "The Miracle Bells" all I've got... So that the god may smile upon us. 
I want to make this play a success... No matter what. 
Reni... 
Sorry, Captain. I know you're in the middle of your night watch. 
No, it's fine. Don't worry about it. 
Thanks. All right, I'm going back to my room. 
I see. Good night, Reni. 
Good night, Captain. 
Well... I ought to get going, too. 
Watch you... dance? 
When I was in the Star Division, I learned ballet. 
I see... I had no idea. 
Well then... Here I go. 
Hah! 
(Whoa...) 
(Reni's always so quiet, I never imagined she could dance with such passion.) 
Did you know... There's a god of the stage? 
...A god? 
That's right. Whenever an actor surpasses a certain level with their dance or performance... 
The god smiles as he watches them perform. 
So I'm going to give "The Miracle Bells" all I've got... So that the god may smile upon us. 
I want to make this play a success... No matter what. 
Reni... 
Sorry, Captain. I know you're in the middle of your night watch. 
No, it's fine. Don't worry about it. 
Thanks. All right, I'm going back to my room. 
I see. Good night, Reni. 
Good night, Captain. 
Well... I ought to get going, too. 
I appreciate the offer, but I'm in the middle of my night watch. 
I see... Sorry. 
All right, I'm going to go. Try not to stay up too late, OK, Reni? 
Yes, understood. 
Sorry, Reni. As the person picking the lead, I can't watch only you dance. 
I see... Sorry. 
All right, I'm going to go. Try not to stay up too late, OK, Reni? 
Yes, understood. 
OK... Time to start patrolling underground. 
Hm? Is that you, Kanna? 
Oh, Boss? 
I was just readin' the lines for the Holy Mother... This is tough. 
I've played almost nothing but masculine roles like King Lear or Son Goku up till now. 
Do you really think I have what it takes to play a feminine role like this? 
Of course you do! 
Well, who knows? 
True, that might be tough. 
Of course you do! You'd be great, Kanna. 
Huh? R-really? 
Yeah, really. Don't think about it so hard. 
Just throw yourself into it like you always do, Kanna. 
Boss... 
Thanks, Boss. I'm feelin' a bit more confident now. 
It's true, there's some performances only I can do in the Flower Division. 
I just gotta do things my own way. Maybe a boyish heroine wouldn't be so bad. 
Heheh, now I'm lookin' forward to how this play turns out, too. 
Kanna... 
Thanks, Boss! Whether I get the lead or not, I think I can put in a good performance. 
All right, time for me to hit the hay already. Night, Boss! 
Yeah, good night. 
Well... I ought to get going, too. 
Well, who knows? Nobody knows how things will turn out. 
But no matter what role you wind up with, so long as you give it your all, I know it'll turn out great. 
Boss... 
You're right. Worrying's not gonna get me anywhere. 
I'll do my best, in my own way. 
Heheh, they might even like that the lead's more boyish than they expected. 
Kanna... 
Thanks, Boss! Whether I get the lead or not, I think I can put in a good performance. 
All right, time for me to hit the hay already. Night, Boss! 
Yeah, good night. 
Well... I ought to get going, too. 
True, that might be tough. 
You think so too, huh, Boss? 
This is way too big of a role for me... 
Well, whether I get the lead or not, I'll give it all I've got. 
I see... 
Oh, whoops, would ya look at the time. 
All right, time for me to hit the hay already. Night, Boss! 
Yeah, good night. 
Well... I ought to get going, too. 
Sorry, Kanna. As the person picking the lead, there's nothing I can tell you. 
Ah... You're right. 
My bad, I was talkin' nonsense. 
All right, time for me to hit the hay already. Night, Boss! 
Yeah, good night. 
Well... I ought to get going, too. 
Now then, up next is the music room. 
Hm? Orihime, is that you? 
That voice... 
Ensign. On your night watch, are you? 
Were you playing the piano just now? 
Yes... That's what I came here to do... 
But whenever I think about playing it... I just can't do it. 
Huh? 
To play the piano, you need not only your fingers, but your heart, too. 
Usually I just move my fingers without having to think... 
Maybe it's because I don't have a good mental image for the lead role of "The Miracle Bells"... 
Orihime... 
Believe in yourself, Orihime. 
It happens. 
You should get to bed. 
Believe in yourself, Orihime. Tell yourself you can do it. 
Try to remember the usual Orihime, overflowing with confidence. 
Ensign... 
... 
...! I did it! 
See, Orihime? You were able to play the piano just now. 
Ensign... Thank you. 
You don't have to worry about me anymore, Ensign. 
I'm back to my normal self! Overflowing with confidence! 
Hahaha... Glad to hear it. 
I've got the perfect mental image of the lead role for the Christmas play. 
You can relax, Ensign, the play's in buone mani! 
(...Buone mani? Does she mean to say the play's in good hands?) 
It happens. Don't rush things, just wait it out. 
You'll be able to play again before long. 
...Really? 
You're always so full of confidence, so you might not have a lot of experience with this... 
But everyone has their off days, you know? 
... 
All right, you should probably head to bed for today. 
Understood. All right, Ensign, good night. 
Yeah, good night. 
Right, I should get going too. 
You must be tired. You should go to bed for today. 
... 
C'mon, Orihime... 
It's frustrating, but I'll go back to my room. 
All right then, Ensign, good night. 
Yeah, good night. 
Right, I should get going too. 
Sorry, Orihime. As the person picking the lead, there's nothing I can tell you. 
...Oh, that's right. 
I don't see the harm in talking about something like this, though. 
All right, Ensign, I'll be going back to my room. Good night. 
Yeah, good night. 
Right, I should get going too. 
Let's see... Let's check backstage. 
Oh... Kohran? 
Ah, Chief! 
Couldn't sleep? 
Y-Yeah... 
I was just thinkin' about the Christmas play... 
Chief... What do you think will happen if I'm the star? 
You can't tell when it's all tied up in braids, but my hair's actually super frizzy. 
On top of that, I can't see a thing without my glasses, so I gotta wear them on stage. 
The Holy Mother, wearing glasses... That'd just be weird, huh? 
Of course not. 
That might actually make it better. 
You might be right. 
Of course not. You're worrying too much. 
Your glasses, your hair, that's not what matters. 
It's the emotion of the performer that matters most, isn't it? 
Chief... 
Talking with you has made me feel a bit more confident somehow... 
I'm gonna try my best. 
I'm gonna get up on that stage with all the emotion I've got! 
Kohran... 
All right then, I'll head back to my room. 
Thanks a bunch, Chief. I mean it. Good luck with your night watch! 
Kohran... 
Actually... That might make it even better. 
A heroine wearing glasses? That's fresh and new! 
Y-Ya think so...? 
Sure I do! Have a little faith in yourself, Kohran. 
Your cheerfulness is the best thing about you. Bring that with you up on stage! 
Chief... 
All right, Chief, I'll do it! 
Whether I get the lead or not, I'm gonna be so cheerful up there! 
I'll show everyone in the audience my good side! 
Kohran... 
I think I feel all better now. 
All right, I'm gonna head back to my room. Good luck with your night watch! 
Sure, good night. 
Good night, Chief... And thanks a lot... I mean it. 
Kohran... 
Hmm... You might be right. 
You think so too, huh, Chief? 
I knew it, I can't do it with these glasses of mine... 
Kohran... 
...It's OK, Chief. 
I'll do my best up there, in my own way! 
I think my upbeat personality's my strong point. 
So whether I get the lead role or not, I'm gonna give it my all! 
I see... 
All right then, I'll head back to my room. 
Thanks a bunch, Chief. I mean it. Good luck with your night watch! 
Kohran... 
Sorry, Kohran. I've been worrying about who to pick, myself. 
I can't be having this discussion with you if I'm going to remain impartial. 
Ah... R-Right! 
You're totally right. Sorry 'bout that. 
All right, Chief, I'm gonna head back to my room. 
Sure. Good night, Kohran. 
Night, Chief. Good luck with your night watch. 
Well... I ought to get going, too. 
OK, last up, time to check the stage. 
Hm? Sounds like someone's here. 
Spin to the right... Put your foot out... 
(It's Sakura. Is she practicing some kind of dance?) 
...Who is it? 
(...! She spotted me?!) 
Ogami... 
Sorry, Sakura. Didn't mean to interrupt your dance practice. 
No, it's all right. I was thinking about wrapping up anyway. 
I see... 
Were you practicing for the upcoming play? 
N-No, that was just a dance I learned a long time ago. 
Whenever I feel like I'm about to lose track of my current role or the play... 
I always repeat that dance. 
Sakura... 
You've got this, Sakura. 
The fundamentals are important. 
You should get to bed. 
You've got this, Sakura. 
Thank you. I'll do my best. 
I'll go back to basics, start fresh and do my utmost best. 
That way I won't regret not having given it everything I got. 
Sakura... 
All right, Ogami, I'll be going back to my room. Good work on your night watch. 
Yeah, thanks. Good night, Sakura. 
Of course. Good night, Ogami. 
OK, it's about time I wrapped up my night watch. I should head back to my room, too. 
The fundamentals are important. Sometimes you just have to go back to basics. 
Yes, that's true. 
I remember the first time I danced... How nervous I felt, how much fun I had... 
And I remember how I felt going up on stage for the very first time... 
I feel like it all came back to me just now. 
Sakura... 
All right, Ogami, I'll be going back to my room. Good work on your night watch. 
Yeah, thanks. Good night, Sakura. 
Of course. Good night, Ogami. 
OK, it's about time I wrapped up my night watch. I should head back to my room, too. 
Don't overdo it, it's bad for your health. You should get to bed. 
...OK. Understood. 
Good work on your night watch, Ogami. Good night. 
Yeah, good night, Sakura. 
OK, it's about time I wrapped up my night watch. I should head back to my room, too. 
Sorry, Sakura. As the person picking the lead, there's nothing I can tell you. 
Ah... S-Sorry, I said some weird things, didn't I? 
Don't worry about what I said just now. 
All right, Ogami, I'll be going back to my room. Good work on your night watch. 
Yeah, thanks. Good night, Sakura. 
Of course. Good night, Ogami. 
OK, it's about time I wrapped up my night watch. I should head back to my room, too. 
Phew, finally done with my night watch. 
Still, everyone's doing their best for this Christmas play. 
Just who should I pick...? 
Sorry, Ogami, but each customer is only allowed to purchase one photo at a time. 
I see. That's too bad. 
Sorry, Ogami, but each customer is only allowed to purchase one photo at a time. 
Oh, really? That's too bad.
