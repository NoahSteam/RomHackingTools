Several days after the fire incident in Fukagawa... 
Huh?! 
I-Isn't he...? 
The old man from the restaurant? 
Indeed. I am that old man, Kazutoyo Yamaguchi, the Navy minister. 
M-Minister Yamaguchi... I apologize my disrespect for not realizing that back then! 
I-I'm sorry for calling you "old man." 
Please, I don't mind that. I was also in disguise back then. 
Who would expect that a drunken old man at a ryotei turns out to be Minister of the Navy, eh? 
W-We apologize for troubling you! 
Firstly, the way the Imperial Assault Troupe fights is truly magnificent. 
The group called the Black Demon Society has been threatening Tokyo with their evil power. 
Additionally, there's been disturbing reports of extremist activity by those in our military. 
I don't want to make any rash moves involving our men. 
However, I promise that the Imperial Assault Troupe will have the navy's full support. 
What's more, I'm a fan of your theater shows. I can't wait to see the Flower Division put on their next performance. 
To ensure that, I'll also pass along some words to my peers in the financial world. 
Does that mean... 
We don't have to worry about being poor anymore? 
I wish you a long life so that you can see Sumire Kanzaki's performance every day. 
Yaaaayy! I love you, Uncle! 
Hahahaha!! I'm happy to hear that. Good luck, young ones! 
R-Roger! 
That's quite a relief, Captain. 
Yeah, all thanks to Sakura and Kohran's reckless behavior. 
Yeowch... That was harsh, Chief. 
Oh, Ogami... You're so mean! 
Tee-hee-hee! 
Ahahahaha... 
Sorry Ogami, but each customer is only allowed to purchase one photo at a time. 
I see. That's too bad... 
My apologies Ogami, but each customer is only allowed to purchase one photo at a time. 
Oh, really? That's too bad...
