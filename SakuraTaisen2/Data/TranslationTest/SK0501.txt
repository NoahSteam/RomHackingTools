Phew... We're pretty much done cleaning the gift shop. 
Thank you very much, Ogami! 
Thank you for your hard work, Ogami. Having you here is a big help to us. 
Now that both the gift shop and our office are done... We can go on vacation without having to worry! 
Right. Summer break's starting tomorrow for them. 
That means I'll be free from doing odd jobs for a while. 
Heheh. Now we can relax for a while. 
Ogami, u-uhm... I will be away from the theater for a mission. 
In the meantime, there will be a new girl taking care of the shop. Please take care of her. 
Huh? What mission!? 
U-Uh, that's... 
Sorry, Ogami. It's so top-secret that even we haven't been told about it. 
Yep. What's more, even my sources can't figure out what this mission is. 
Tee-hee! Actually, I haven't gotten the details yet. 
I-I see. Now I'm really curious. 
Yo! I'm baaaack! 
Huh? That voice, could it be... 
Yo, Ogami! Kasumi! Yuri! Tsubaki! It's been a while. 
M-Mr. Yoneda! 
Welcome home, sir! 
Are you all healed now? 
Yup, I'm fit as a fiddle now. Sorry to have made you guys worry. 
Yayyy! Now this is great news! I'm gonna tell everyone right away! 
Hahaha, Yuri's acting just like always. There's no place like home, after all! 
Now that I'm home, we're going to celebrate with everyone! Let's go kick things off with a bang! 
(Oh boy... Looks like he's gonna throw a huge bash.) 
To have such a big hospital-leaving party for me... Thanks, you guys. 
Oh... We could have prepared a better party for you if we had more time. 
Yeah... You should have told us sooner. 
She's right, Mr. Yoneda. That's too sudden. 
Hehe, I didn't want to trouble you by making you plan out the whole thing. 
Anyway, you look great in that outfit, Maria. 
Wouldn't you agree, Ogami? 
It suits you very well, Maria. 
You look cool, Maria. 
You're beautiful, Maria. 
It suits you very well, Maria. 
Is... Is that so? Thank you very much, Captain. 
Wahahaha! That's quite the smooth-talking, Ogami. 
You look pretty cool, Maria. 
Ahaha. Is that so? Thank you very much. 
Hey, Ogami, come on. Maria's a woman, you know? 
I'm sure there are better ways to say that. Jeez, you can be so dense. 
It's fine, Manager. The captain just gave his honest thoughts. 
Hearing him praise me is enough. 
Maria... You're beautiful. It's taking my breath away. 
Ca-Captain! Please, not in front of everyone else... 
That's some kind of way to smooth-talk, Ogami. 
How could Ensign say something so irritating? 
Gahahahaha! Well, fine enough. Now this is the Flower Division that I know. 
I uh... Well... How do I put it into words? 
Mr. Yoneda! Look at the captain, he's all confused after you asked him such an unexpected question. 
Wahaha! Sorry, Maria. I didn't mean to tease you two that much. 
But I kinda expected that Ogami would have something of the sort. 
R-Right... 
Anyways, you guys helped me a lot by taking care of things while I was gone. 
Let me say it again, I truly thank each and every one of you. 
Mr. Yoneda, it wasn't a big deal. The Flower Division is all about helping each other out, right? 
Yeah. You're one of us, Commander. 
Hehe... Aw, come on. You guys are too kind. 
Well, allow me to reward your hard work after everything that's happened with a gift. 
A gift? 
That's right. Starting tomorrow, you're on summer break. 
Everyone needs to relax once in a while. All of you are going on a trip. 
Huh!? A trip? 
Yep. In fact I've already taken care of your arrangements. 
By tomorrow, you're going to be staying at a resort in Atami. Four days and three nights. 
Even I've heard of Atami! It's a town known all over for their hot springs. 
Go have fun and relax with everyone in the Flower Division, Ogami. 
Thank you, sir! 
Aren't you coming with us, Mr. Yoneda? 
Will the theater be OK? 
Thank you very much! We'll make sure to enjoy ourselves to the fullest! 
Uh-huh. 
Oh right, seems that Saki wants to go, too. Take her with you. 
The manager and I will be staying here, so take it easy. 
But don't forget to bring your Cinematron, Ogami. 
Contact us in case something happens, we'll send the Soaring Whale. 
Roger. In that case, we'll gladly take your offer. 
Aren't you coming with us, you two? 
I need to take care of things I had from before I went to the hospital. Just go on without us. 
Oh right, seems that Saki wants to go, too. Take her with you. 
Every once in a while, you should kick back and not need to worry about us. 
But don't forget to bring your Cinematron, Ogami. 
Contact us in case something happens, we'll send the Soaring Whale. 
Is that so. Then we'll gladly take your offer. 
While we're gone, will the theater be OK? What if the Black Demon Society shows up somewhere? 
Don't worry about it. I've made some arrangements for that. 
The manager and I will be staying here, so take it easy. 
But don't forget to bring your Cinematron, Ogami. 
Contact us in case something happens, we'll send the Soaring Whale. 
Is that so. Then we'll gladly take your offer. 
Uh... What should I... 
No need to worry about the theater, Ogami. 
The manager and I will be staying here, so take it easy. 
But don't forget to bring your Cinematron, Ogami. 
Contact us in case something happens, we'll send the Soaring Whale. 
Is that so. Then we'll gladly take your offer. 
Having summer vacation at a hot spring resort, that doesn't sound bad at all. 
Yes, it sounds fun. Ooh, I'm so excited! 
Yaaay, yaaay!! We're going on a trip! A trip! 
It'll be my first time vacationing in Japan. 
I've never gone to Atami before. I'm so excited! 
A break is necessary at times... 
Alllll right! We're so gonna eat and play to our heart's content! 
What a pleasant present we've received, Captain. 
Yeah. Looks like we're in for a fun summer vacation. 
Now then, today's the day we're finally going to depart for our trip. 
Our meeting point is the entrance hall. We'll depart on 10 o'clock, I guess. I still got 1 hour to spare now. 
I'll check everyone first. 
Ah, morning, Chief. 
Good morning, Kohran. Are you done preparing for the trip? 
Yup, already done. I'm about to go to the hangar for a bit. 
Looks like everyone else is still in their rooms. 
I see. I guess everyone's still packing their things. 
OK, I'm off. See ya later, Chief. 
I should be going, too. 
No one's here yet. Seems that I came too early. 
Everyone will be gathering here at 10 o'clock. I should kill some more time and come back later. 
Oh, it's Reni. Hey! 
Good morning, Reni. 
...Morning. 
Arf, arf! 
Seems that <name> wants to play with you again. 
Now he's even more attached to you than before. 
Arf! 
... 
Reni... 
Have you gotten used to him? 
Let me join. 
Try to pet his head. 
Have you gotten used to him? 
...Used to what? 
To <name>, of course. Weren't you having a hard time dealing with him? 
...Not really. I'm just not that interested. 
Can I play with him, too? Let me join. 
... 
You want to play with us, don't you? 
Arf! 
Reni, look. He just said yes. 
...He was just reacting to a human's voice, not you specifically. 
R-Reni... 
You can pat his head, like this. Come on. 
Wooofff... 
See? Now he's getting happy. 
... 
Arf, arf! 
Try it, Reni. 
... 
... 
Ah, Reni! 
Aw... Reni went away. 
Arf, arf, arf! 
Ah, <name>... 
... 
Hahaha, he's chasing after Reni. 
<name> sure seems to have taken a liking to that kid. 
Wooofff... 
Left you behind, huh? 
Don't worry. It's not your fault. 
Woof. 
Oh, isn't that Kohran right there? 
Heeey, Kohran! 
That voice... Is that you, Chief? 
Man, it's been hot since the sun came up. Summer is really coming, eh? 
I've been picking tomatoes that we've been growin' in this courtyard and I'm already sweating a ton. 
I know, mind if I ask for your help picking these tomatoes? 
Oh, no problem! 
I'm busy right now. 
Oh, no problem! I'd be glad to help. 
Really? Thanks, Chief! 
I'd like to, but I'm busy right now. 
Aw... That's too bad. Can't help it since yer busy. 
I'll see you in the entrance hall, then. 
Hmmm, what should I do? 
You got nothing else to do, right? What do ya say, Chief? 
...OK. I'll help you. 
Thanks, Chief! I knew you were gonna say yes! 
Actually, picking tomatoes aren't the important thing to worry over. 
The important thing to worry about is over there... 
Are those... crows? 
You betcha. They've been flying around tryin' to eat these. 
They've eaten so many of our veggies lately. 
I'm not gonna let them have these tomatoes! 
I need you to drive them away with these smoke bombs I made, Chief. 
B-But... If I throw these, won't it hurt? 
No worries. My smoke bombs will just make them dizzy for a bit, it won't harm them. 
I'm leavin' it up to you! The fate of these tomatoes are in yer hands! 
I managed to pick all the tomatoes safely. Thanks a lot, Chief! 
The crows are doing fine, too. All's well that ends well! 
I managed to pick the tomatoes. Thanks, Chief! 
Some of them got eaten by the crows, but they can't help it. 
They ate most of the tomatoes... 
Sorry, Kohran... If only I could have aimed better. 
Nah, it's fine. You just did your best, Chief. 
They got us this time, but I won't let it happen again! 
Kohran... 
By the way, I didn't even know that you were growing tomatoes over here. 
Hehe, y'know my experiments are usually about machines. I wanted to branch out and do some experiments on vegetables, too. 
If all goes well, I'm sure the vegetables that we've grown will taste a lot more special. 
Haha... Well, I suppose you're right. 
Ah, look at the time! I better get going. 
I'm really grateful for your help. Later, Chief! 
It's very Kohran to use smoke bombs to drive the crows away. 
I better get going. 
Oh, I just finished picking the tomatoes, Chief. 
Some of them got eaten by crows, but I still managed to pick a few. 
I see. That's great. 
Yup. Now I can go on the trip without having to worry. 
Well then, see ya later, Chief. 
Seems that she managed to pick the tomatoes. That's a relief. 
Now maybe I should go somewhere else. 
Arf, arf! 
We're gonna go on a trip for a while, <name>. 
Take care of the theater while we're gone, OK? 
Arf! 
Yo, Boss! C'mere, c'mere! 
Great timing, Boss. 
I'm havin' breakfast right now, how about we have another eatin' contest? 
Oh, nice idea. So, what're we eating? 
It's an Okinawan dish called "Mimiga." It's a pork dish. 
The rules are just like our first contest, the one who finishes the 3-course meal first wins. 
I'm gonna win this time, Kanna! 
Well, let's do this! Ready, aaaand, begin! 
OK, what should I grab first? 
Mimiga 
Rice 
Barley Tea 
This pork... It's kind of weird looking. 
Hehe... That's cause Mimiga is actually made from pig's ears. 
It has a crunchy texture and it tastes great. Try it. 
Munch, munch, crunch... Mm-hm! It does tastes great! 
Oh, and the rice is also perfect. Munch, munch... 
Summer's just begun, so we have a refreshing barley tea. 
Gulp, gulp... OK, I finished the tea! 
Which one I should grab first? I'm not sure... 
What're you doing, Boss? I'm going to beat you to the finish if you don't start chowin' down. 
OK, I finished the first dish. What do you think, Kanna? 
Hey, not bad, Boss. Seems that you've improved since last month, huh? 
All right... Time to get serious. 
I'm not gonna lose! OK, now here comes the second dish! 
Mimiga... 
Rice... 
Barley tea... 
Never thought I would eat pig ears so early in the morning... 
Whew, I managed to finish eating just about everything on the plate! 
Eating two bowls of rice in the morning is quite... tough. 
Munch.... Munch... OK, I managed to finish it. 
Gulp... Gulp... 
Phew, I can slow down a bit thanks to this tea. 
Is it just me or... I can't seem to move my chopsticks anymore. 
What's wrong? You bout to give up, Boss? 
Phew, I finally managed to finish the second dish... 
Way to go, Boss! I can't afford to be careless now! 
OK. Now, time to finish the third batch... I can do this! 
Mi... miga... 
Steamed... rice... 
Barley... tea... 
Mi... miga... Four pieces to go... 
Munch, munch... Three pieces... 
Chomp, chomp... Two pieces... 
Crunch, crunch... One... 
Th-There! I finished all the Mimiga! 
After everything that's happened, I'm starting to get sick just by the sight of rice... 
Anyway... One bowl to go... I'm finishing this. 
Munch... Gobble... Urk... 
All riiight! I finished all of the rice! 
Glug... Glug... Glug! 
Hey, hey, don't just chug it all down in one go! 
Pwaaah! O-OK... I finished drinking the tea! 
Huft... Huft... 
Hey, Boss, you OK?! You can take it easy now. 
I-I'm fine. I'm so gonna win this contest! 
Oh, yeah! I finished the third batch! 
Huhhh!? Y-You already finished it all!? 
Hehe... This was just a regular breakfast to me. 
Whew, that was a great meal. 
Too bad for you, Boss. That was close, you were just about to finish the third dish. 
You did great, but looks like you still have a long way to go before you can beat me. 
Seems like eatin' three bowls in the mornin' is too much for you. 
I give up... You completely smoked me this time, Kanna. 
Well, now I can go on the trip full of energy! 
K-Kanna, I finished my third plate! How do you like that? 
Aw, too bad. You were almost able to keep up with me! 
See, I'm at my fourth helping now, so I'm a whole plate ahead. 
F-For real? You sure are something, Kanna. 
You're something too, Boss. The fact you're keepin' up with me after just a month is amazing. 
Just like people say, "little and often makes much." You sticking with it is paying off. Hahaha! 
You can leave the tidyin' to me, Boss. 
I see, thanks. Next time, I won't lose. 
Hehe, you better win! Let's have another eatin' contest next chance we get! 
Sheesh, that was a lot more than I usually eat, even for dinner. 
Now then, it's almost time to meet up in the front. I should get going. 
Kanna's already done putting the dishes away. 
Making sure to follow through with what she started, that's very much Kanna's style. 
No one's here. I guess everyone's already had breakfast. 
I wonder, is Kanna is doing an eating contest today? 
Maybe I should try coming back again some time later. 
There's nothing much I can do in here, I better go to another place. 
I wonder if Mr. Yoneda is in here. 
It's Ogami. Are you inside? 
... 
Seems like he's not there. 
I better check another room, I guess. 
I wonder if Mr. Yoneda is in here. 
I better check another room, I guess. 
It's Ogami. Are you inside? 
Oh, Ogami. Yeah, come on in. 
Right. Pardon me. 
Hello, Captain. 
Oh? What're you doing here, Maria? 
I wanted to send my regards to the manager before we left for the trip. 
Commander Yoneda, we're leaving the theater in your care. 
Of course, you can count on it. 
Likewise, please take care of everyone in the Flower Division. 
Yes, you can count on us. 
I'm rarin' to go. 
I'll have Maria with me. 
Of course, you can count on us. I'll make sure to lead everyone in the right direction. 
I leave them in your care then, Captain. 
Well, having you two "chaperones" going along with them makes me not have to worry as much. 
Take it easy and make sure to have fun, you two. 
Yes, sir! 
We're all going to go hog wild when we get there! 
Haha. I like the enthusiasm, but seems Maria's glaring at you now. 
...Captain, please, restrain yourself a bit. 
Ye-Yes! I'll be careful! 
Wahahahaha! At any rate, take it easy and have fun, you two. 
You can relax, Mr. Yoneda. I'll have Maria by my side to keep everyone in check. 
Captain, please... 
Oho, I see you're placing a good deal of trust in her. 
Well, having you two "chaperones" going along with them makes me not have to worry as much. 
Aye. 
Hm? Ogami, were you about to say something? 
Ah... S-Sorry, I just dozed off... 
Hey, hey, are you OK? Don't make a fool out of yourself just because it's hot outside. 
Ogami's always like this... Please take care of everyone, Maria. 
Ah... Y-Yes. 
Captain, please keep yourself together. 
Ye-Yeah... Got it. 
Let's do our best to watch over everyone so we can all relax and have fun together on our trip. 
It's a big responsibility, but we'll pull it off together. 
Yes, it'll be up to us. 
Excuse me, then. I'll see you in the entrance hall at 10 o'clock. 
Having Maria with us is definitely reassuring. 
I need to stay focused so that she can relax and enjoy the trip herself. 
Ah, Mon Frère! 
Yo, Boss! Looking for some snacks to bring along for the ride? 
Oh, I didn't think of that. Are you thinking of bringing some? 
Yeah! I'm gonna bring lots of chocolates and candies! 
I'm gonna bring some heavier food that can fill my stomach, like onigiri. 
If it was you, what would you bring? 
Sweets 
Heavier food 
If it were me, I'd be bringing along sweets. 
Tee-hee! I knew it! 
You should bring lots of candy, too, Kanna! 
All right... That's a good idea. 
OK, do you think 500 packs of chocolate and candy for each person is enough? 
(Do we even have that much in the theater?) 
I guess I'd bring some heavier food along. 
Right? You can't have fun on an empty stomach! 
Think 20 onigiri per person will be enough? 
Nobody other than you can eat 20 rice balls, Kanna! 
O-OK... Then how about 10? 
That still sounds like a full meal and not a snack for the ride... 
I don't need any snacks for myself. 
I mean, I did just eat a giant breakfast with Kanna. 
Ahahahaha! You did, now that you mention it. 
I'll split an onigiri with you when you're starvin', then. 
I'm gonna share half of my chocolates, too! 
Thanks, guys. 
'Kay, Iris. Let's get goin'. 
OK! See you later, Mon Frère! 
Snacks, huh... Now it feels like a picnic. 
OK, I should get going, too. 
We won't have access to the theater's kitchen for the whole trip. 
I wonder, what food they'll be serving at the inn? Oooh, I'm getting excited just thinking about it. 
Hello there, Ogami! Would you like to buy something? 
Buy a photo. 
Talk to Tsubaki. 
Leave. 
Could I buy a photo? 
Sorry, Ogami. I can only sell one photo at a time. 
Please understand, we need to keep some for the customers. 
You'd like to buy a photo? Thank you very much! 
That's a photo of Sakura. 
Let's see... Sakura's photo, right? 
That'll be 50 sen. Thank you very much! 
That's a photo of Sumire. 
Let's see... Sumire's photo, right? 
That'll be 50 sen. Thank you very much! 
That's a photo of Maria. 
Let's see... Maria's photo, right? 
That'll be 50 sen. Thank you very much! 
That's a photo of Kanna. 
Let's see... Kanna's photo, right? 
That'll be 50 sen. Thank you very much! 
That's a photo of Iris. 
Let's see... Iris's photo, right? 
That'll be 50 sen. Thank you very much! 
That's a photo of Kohran. 
Let's see... Kohran's photo, right? 
That'll be 50 sen. Thank you very much! 
That's a photo of Orihime. 
Let's see... Orihime's photo, right? 
That'll be 50 sen. Thank you very much! 
That's a photo of Reni. 
Let's see... Reni's photo, right? 
That'll be 50 sen. Thank you very much! 
Hm, so... you're not going to buy anything? 
We won't be able to see each other for a while, Ogami... 
You'll come back. right? 
...Yes. Please buy my photos when I got back, OK? 
Of course. I'll buy them here for sure. 
Ogami... Thank you very much! 
Please have fun on you summer vacation! 
I'm looking forward to hearing your stories about it! 
Got it, I'll be going now. 
Tsubaki... Come back safely, OK? 
Yes, leave that to me! My brightness is my good point! 
You too. Please make sure you take care of yourself! 
My, you came here like clockwork, Ogami. 
If you're interested in rumors, I'm all out. Sorry. 
I see, that's too bad. 
I'll have some more interesting tidbits to share another time, so look forward to it! 
Hi, Yuri, Kasumi. Are you doing the last bits of cleanup? 
Yes, we just finished sorting the documents. 
Ogami, listen to these rumors I gathered before you go on your trip. 
Or, do you need something right now, Ogami? 
You're gonna listen to my gossip, right, Ogami? 
Listen to the rumor. 
I'll come back later. 
I wonder what kind of secret mission Tsubaki's being assigned to. I'm curious. 
I wonder, too, since neither you or Kasumi know anything about it. 
It must be important for all this secrecy... 
But regardless, I'm sure Tsubaki will be up to the task and come home safely. 
Right, right. It's Tsubaki we're talking about, after all. There's no need to worry about her. 
Ogami, you have got to hear about this. Kasumi, she met a ghost in the storage room!! 
Ugh, don't. I'm getting chills down my spine just from remembering it. 
So... What was the ghost like? 
Well, yesterday, Kasumi went down to the storage room to get some food for the kitchen pantry. 
She heard a voice moan "leave iiiitttt." 
Yuri! I said stop! 
But, Kohran also said she's been hearing weird voices in there. Maybe there really is a ghost... 
How come you two aren't coming along on the trip? 
We still need to do lots of things around the theater, on top of helping out with Tsubaki's transfer papers. 
What's more, I think Tsubaki would feel pretty left out if she knew we were all going on the trip without her. 
I see... 
Do you remember the yakuza boss that got trapped in the fire at the ryotei? 
Huh? Oh, the guy that was in the room that Sakura and Kohran infiltrated by mistake? 
Yes, that one! Seems when he had to evacuate, he got saved by people from that neighborhood. 
Seems that he learned the warmth in the hearts of people helping each other out. 
He turned over a new leaf and is now helping out the community. 
All of his gang members are cleaning up the streets, too. 
Earlier, they cleaned up the street in front of the theater. Deep down, they really are good people. 
Have you read today's edition of Tokyo News? 
No, I haven't, is there an interesting article? 
Steam Office in Turmoil over Measuring System." Right, Kasumi? 
Yes, precisely. 
Turmoil over Measuring System"? What do you mean by that? 
It seems right now that Japan is using several different systems of measurement at the same time. 
The main ones right now are traditional Japanese, Metric, and English Imperial Units... 
All the plumbing pipes were measured in different systems, so now all the officials are confused! 
I see, that must be hard on them. 
Ah, yes, did you know about this, Ogami? 
I heard the resort inn you're staying at on this trip is owned by friends of the manager. 
Is that so. 
Looks like he organized all the accommodations so that the Flower Division can relax. 
He said since it's his friend's resort, you can relax just like it was your own home. 
It's just like him to think of all that for us. 
By the way, I heard that Gakushuin Girls' School will start commoners as students starting this spring. 
If I recall, Sumire graduated from there. 
Huh? So up until now, Gakushuin didn't allow common folk in? 
Yes. There used to be a rule that the school would only accept girls from noble families. 
But it seems that this rule has been erased. That's a good thing, I think. 
But, the entrance exam still costs you 5 yen. Guess it's still a school for the rich. 
It's not easy to get in? Hmph, that's boring. 
When it comes to summer, Koshien field is all people think about, right, Yuri? 
You mean the high school baseball tournament that's been on the radio lately? I wonder which school will win. 
Oh, if I recall, its venue moved to "Koshien" last year. 
Yes. It's said to be the largest baseball stadium in all of Asia. 
That said, doesn't this tournament makes you want to support a team from your hometown? 
Hahaha, I do, now that you mention it. I wonder if there's a team from there this year. 
Sorry, Ogami, but I'm all out of gossip for now. 
I'll have some more interesting tidbits to share another time, so look forward to it! 
I'll come again. Please take care of the theater while we go on the trip. 
OK. Make sure to relax and enjoy yourself, Ogami. 
I'm looking forward to hearing more juicy stories. 
Tell me all of them when you get back, OK? 
...From there... The sea... After that, I... 
That voice. Is that you, Saki? 
M-My... Ogami? 
What are you doing in this place? 
I could say the same, Saki. I heard your voice coming from here... 
Tee-hee, I couldn't stop getting excited for our trip to the hot springs. 
I was just thinking of all the things I could do when we arrive. Must have started talking out loud. 
Uh-huh... 
I just love hot springs, so I asked for special permission to come along. 
Bathing in the warm water makes me more beautiful. 
What do you hope to get when we enter the hot spring, Ogami? 
To reenergize my soul. 
To have a strong drink. 
To rest my bones. 
I want to reenergize my soul. 
Oh, hmmhmm. Being so earnest as usual, Ogami. 
It makes me want to see you in a shared bath... 
Having a good drink, I guess. I'm sure the best spot for it is in an outdoor bath. 
My, that sounds lovely! 
Shall I pour some for you when the time comes? 
My body's been feeling real stiff these days. I just want to sit down and relax. 
Oh... That's too bad. 
I know, I'll give you a gentle massage after you're done bathing. 
I haven't put much thought into it, guess I'll just take a bath like I normally would. 
Hehe, not a bad idea. 
Shall I scrub your back for you there? 
...What?! R-Really? 
Hmm-hmm, look forward to it when we get there. 
I'll see you later. I can't wait for the trip. 
S-Saki... Was she being serious with that? 
I feel like this trip will definitely be something. 
The scent of Saki's perfume is still lingering around a bit. 
There's no point in dawdling around here. Let's head to another room. 
Nobody's here... 
Well, since we're leaving soon, we don't need this room much. 
The theater is on break, so we're leaving these costumes lying out in this room for a while. 
We might not even use this room until the autumn performance next month. 
Seems that we won't be using the music room while we're on summer break. 
Though once we get back, everyone will get right back into rehearsing. 
No one's on stage since there's no rehearsals. 
I should just go to another room. 
We're holding our autumn performance next month... 
I'm sure everyone will give amazing performances after recharging on this trip. 
The theater is closed for summer break, so the doors are shut. 
Now that I think about it, I wonder who's going to do night patrols while I'm away... 
I hope this place will be filled with guests during the autumn performance next month. 
Well, judging from our last performance, it should be fine. 
The theater's on break for the summer, so there's no customers. 
OK, I better go to another room now. 
I wonder if Sakura is inside. 
It's just like Sakura to have a cute nameplate like this. 
OK, let's check another room. 
Yeees? Who is it? 
It's Ogami. May I come in, Sakura? 
Ah, it's you, Ogami. The door's unlocked, come in. 
OK, sorry to intrude. 
Good morning, Ogami. 
Morning. Are you done with your preparations for the trip? 
Yes. I was thinking of bring some medicine just in case. 
Oh right, while I'm preparing for the trip, there's something I wanted to ask you. 
Between the colors red, blue, and yellow, which one do you like the most? 
Red 
Blue 
Yellow 
Uh... Red, I guess. 
Red it is. Thanks. 
Uh... Blue, I guess. 
Blue it is. Thanks. 
Uh... Yellow, I guess. 
Yellow it is. Thanks. 
Uh... I don't have any favorite color in particular. 
Is that so... That's a problem. 
I know, since you were in the Navy, how does blue sounds? 
Huh? Oh... It's fine, I guess. 
Why do you ask? 
Uh... That's... 
I-It's nothing. Don't worry about it. 
You telling me that only makes me more curious now. 
A-Anyway... I'm excited to go on this trip with everyone else. 
What are you looking forward to? 
Playing together with everyone. 
Having a feast at the resort. 
Seeing you in a swimsuit. 
Having fun and playing together with everyone, of course. That's what I'm looking forward to. 
I agree! I'm very excited for that, too. 
Going to the beach, having dinner together... I'm sure it'll be exciting. 
If we're talking about the trip, it's definitely having a feast at the resort. I can't wait for it. 
I agree. It's one of the things I'm most looking forward to on the trip. 
That would be... Seeing you in a swimsuit, of course. 
...O-Ogami! 
Ah... Sorry, sorry. I didn't mean to tease you. 
Please stop joking around, you'll get me all embarrassed. 
Uh... There's so much I'm looking forward to. It's hard to choose one. 
Hehe, now that you mention it, you're right. 
Anyway, I hope we can enjoy this trip without getting hurt. 
Yeah, you're right. 
OK, I still want to pack some more things, so excuse me. 
Yeah, got it. See you later, then. 
I wonder if Sakura is inside. 
It's just like Sakura to have a cute nameplate like this. 
OK, let's check another room. 
...She's not here. 
I wonder if Sumire is inside. 
This is a pretty subtle design, considering it's Sumire. 
Let's check another room. 
Yeees? Who is it? 
It's Ogami. 
My, please come inside, Ensign. 
OK, sorry to intrude. 
Morning, Sumire. Are you done preparing for the trip? 
I need just a little more time. As you can see, there's still a lot of things I'd like to bring. 
Spare clothes, makeup, swimsuit, toiletries, my diary, my tea seat just in case. 
Books to read when I'm bored and my special pillow. There's still many things to pack along. 
...Special pillow? 
Yes. I wouldn't be able to sleep without it. 
When I was at my family's house, I went to the effort of having this pillow sent there for me. 
Are you fine sleeping without your usual pillow, Ensign? 
I'm OK without it. 
No, I need it, too. 
I don't use pillows. 
I'm fine without it. I can sleep wherever and whenever. 
My, that's impressive. It must be the training from when you were in the Navy. 
Hahaha, that's a lot of praise for just a small little thing. 
Nah, I need it, too. I can't relax unless it's my usual pillow. 
My, is that so? It's surprised to see the delicate side of you. 
In that case, shouldn't you be bringing your pillow, too? 
Hahaha, it's not that big of a deal to me, though. I'll manage. 
I do have a pillow in my bed, but I don't use it that much. 
My... How can you sleep like that? 
Uh... I guess it's easier for me to fall asleep than most people. 
I'm astonished to learn there are people out there who can sleep without something as basic as a pillow. 
...I hadn't given it much thought until now. 
Well, we do spend a third of our life sleeping, Ensign. 
It's only natural for people to pursue the most comfortable sleep possible. 
I-I see... 
Well then, since I still have more things to prepare... 
I must apologize that we'll have to suspend our tea brewing class, Ensign. 
OK, no problem. I'm be going, then. See you later, Sumire. 
I wonder if Sumire is inside. 
This is a pretty subtle design, considering it's Sumire. 
Let's check another room. 
It's Ogami... 
I'm sorry, Ensign, but preparations are taking longer than I expected. 
I see, sorry for interrupting. 
I wonder if Sumire is inside. 
This is a pretty subtle design, considering it's Sumire. 
Let's check another room. 
There's no answer. Looks like she's not here. 
I wonder if Maria is inside. 
It's Maria's nameplate. 
OK, I'll check another room. 
It's Ogami. Are you there, Maria? 
Oh, Captain, it's you. The door's unlocked, please come in. 
OK. Excuse me. 
Good morning, Captain. 
Morning, Maria. Are you done preparing for the trip? 
Yes. I finished packing last night. 
I see... Just as I thought you would, Maria. 
Now that I think about, I don't visit your room too often. 
True. As you can see, there's noth much to show you. 
(Maria was sleeping on this bed...) 
(I wonder what she wears for sleep.) 
(Pajamas, yukata, she could wear all kinds of stuff.) 
Ask her. 
What kind of outfit do you wear to bed, Maria? 
Huh!? Uh, it's nothing... 
Nothing"? 
It's... Is it really that important to you? 
Huh? What's wrong with the question? 
Everything! 
Oh... S-Sorry. Guess that was pretty unecessary. 
... 
What are you continuing to stare at? 
Er, nothing... 
Captain, it's not polite to stare at a woman's bed. 
(Right, it is impolite to stare so intensely.) 
(The desk has a simple yet functional design. Just like its owner) 
I always use that desk; it's my favorite. 
(That chair has the same design as her desk. Does she always go for simplistic designs?) 
That chair looks just like your desk. I guess you prefer simpler designs, Maria. 
Yes, I tend to gravitate towards things that are easy to determine at first glance. 
What kind of book are you reading? 
Ah, this isn't a book. It's my diary. 
Do you keep one, Captain? 
Yeah, pretty much. 
No, I don't. 
I can't stick to any routine for very long. 
I keep one too, although I don't write in it much. 
I see, so you keep one, too. 
You can always learn something new re-reading how you acted previously. 
No, I don't. 
Is that so? Keeping one is rather fun. 
You can always learn something new re-reading how you acted previously. 
I wanted to try, but I always stop doing it early on. 
Try to make a habit of writing in it at certain times, like before bed or after dinner. 
Even writing a few lines for the day is fine. What matters is you're doing it consistently. 
I see... I'll keep that in mind. Thanks. 
Oh, I'm sorry about you on such a private matter, Captain. 
Oh, it's fine. I don't mind at all. 
Oooh, a diary, hmm? 
C-Captain!! What do you think you're doing?! 
Well... I just want to take a look inside... 
Captain, please! Don't just flip through a person's diary without permission! 
Oh... Sorry. 
*sigh*... You surprise me at times. 
(Aw, I wanted to see what was in Maria's diary.) 
It's felt nice around here since this morning, hasn't it? 
Yeah. Seems that we'll have a fine weather. 
Seeing a mirror like this reminds me that I'm in a woman's room. 
Heh, is that so? 
(There's a group photo of everyone from the theater.) 
Now then, I'll be taking my leave. 
Yes. I'm finished packing myself and was about to go as well. 
How about we get going, Captain? 
We should be finished with our business here. Let's go, Captain. 
If I remember correctly, we should be gathering at the entrance hall at 10 o'clock. 
Yeah. What are you gonna do until then? 
Ah, actually, I was just going to write in my diary. 
I suddenly remembered a game I once tried. I was going to play a bit before we depart. 
Well then, Captain. Please excuse me. 
A game that she... once tried? I wonder what it is. 
Well then, Captain. Please excuse me. 
OK, I should get going now. 
I wonder if Maria is inside. 
It's Maria's nameplate. 
OK, I'll check another room. 
Looks like Maria's not here. 
I wonder if Kanna is inside. 
Kanna's... Well, I guess it's more of a nametag than a nameplate. 
OK, let's check another room. 
Look's like Kanna's not here. 
I wonder if Kanna is inside. 
Kanna's... Well, I guess it's more of a nametag than a nameplate. 
OK, let's check another room. 
U... Uh... 
Who's... there? It's still... early in the morning... 
Hey, Kanna, are you still sleeping? 
Oh, it's you... 
The door's unlocked, you can come in. 
OK, then. Excuse me... 
Fwaaaah... Mornin', Boss. 
...Aah! It's already this late? 
Kanna... You were sleeping like that? 
Uh... Last night, I was exercisin' in here. Must've went straight to bed right after that. 
Aw man, now you caught me when I'm all messed up... 
Jeez, you're so sloppy! 
Come on, you're a girl... 
It can happen sometimes. 
Jeez, you're so sloppy! Get a hold of yourself! 
Sorry... I'll be more careful. 
I'll do better next time, so let me off easy, OK? 
...Just be careful, OK? 
You're a girl, so you need to take better care of yourself. 
Sorry, Boss. I'll be more careful next time. 
You're a girl." Hehe... Now I'm blushin'. 
Well, when you get tired, it happens sometimes. 
...Yeah, right! So it happens to you, too, eh? 
It's just not a good habit, so I'll be careful next time. 
Uh, Boss... Are you mad? 
Nope. I wasn't saying anything, but I didn't mean it that way. 
Can ya give me a pass this time? I'll be more careful. 
I need to change clothes, ASAP. 
Make sure to not be late, Kanna. See you. 
Yeah, thanks! See ya later, then. 
Kanna, are you done yet? 
Oh, Boss. I'm still changin'. 
Thanks for waitin'. Now I'm ready for the trip. 
Are you done packing? 
Hehe, the secret of traveling is that you bring just the bare necessities. 
I'm pretty used to travellin' all over, so I can pack my things pretty quick. 
Hahaha, OK. 
OK, now I wanna have some breakfast. 
You should come, too. Let's have an eatin' contest again. 
I'll see you later. Bye, Boss. 
Hi, Sumire. How's it coming along? 
Well, see... I'm having a spot of trouble. 
I was going to bring a book to read if I get bored during the trip... 
But I'm not sure which one to bring along. 
Hahaha... Is that so. 
If you were in my position, what would you bring along to accompany you? 
A novel. 
A book related to my job. 
A schedule book. 
If I were bringing one, I'd take a novel I can really sink my teeth into, you know? 
I see... That sounds like a good idea. 
Well, if I were bringing one, I'd probably bring a book related to my job like something on military strategy or history. 
*huff* Bringing your work along on vacation is quite the foul idea, Ensign. 
It would bring down everyone's mood. They all want to have fun on this trip. 
I-I see... You have a point. 
Since we're going on a trip, we should bring a schedule book along, right? 
Oh my... That's quite the joke, Ensign. 
Your sense of wit is as sharp as ever. 
Uh... If it were me, I wouldn't bother bringing a book along. 
I just want to forget about my daily life and enjoy what the resort has to offer to the fullest. 
I see... You do have a point. 
Thank you, Ensign. You were most helpful. 
We're going to gather at the entrance at 10 o'clock, so I will see you later. 
OK, I should get going too right now. 
Uh... No one's here. 
I guess everyone's busy preparing stuff for the trip. 
Oh, Mon Frère! Good morning! 
I'm going to bring some cards along on the trip! 
I have to get going! See you later, Mon Frère! 
Iris is especially cheerful this morning. 
Well, I'm sure everyone's excited for the trip. 
Now, I should head to another room. 
Oh, if it isn't Maria. 
Oh, Captain. 
During my trip to America, I learned how to play billiards and I wanted to brush up on my skills before we left. 
I see, so this is the "game you once tried" that you were talking about. 
Yes. Would you like to try it? 
Would you like to try? 
OK, let's play! 
I don't know the rules... 
OK, let's play! I've been wanting to play with this pool table for quite awhile 
Haha. Well then, let's play a quick game of nine-ball. 
It'll be a nice way to kill some time before we depart. 
OK... Shall we play, then? 
I don't really know how to play billiards... 
In that case, I'll teach you while we play. 
Since we still have some time before we depart, let's play a quick game of nine-ball. 
The rules are simple. You hit the cue ball with your cue stick... 
...and then have it hit the ball labeled with the lowest number into a pocket, those holes in the table. 
The winner is the one who sinks the ball labeled number 9 into the pocket. 
I see... Doesn't seem as hard as I thought it would be. 
Well then, let's play right away. 
Hmm, what to do... 
I think it'll be a nice way to spend some time before we have to leave. 
Playing a round of nine-ball won't take us much time. 
Well, let's play, then. 
Sure. Let's play a quick game of nine-ball. 
Now it's your turn, Captain. This is your chance to drop the 9 ball. 
For this one, you need to use a bit more power and strike the ball as hard as possible. 
Hit. 
Hit it hard. 
OK... Here I go! 
Aw... I guess that was too soft. 
You should hit it a bit harder, Captain. 
You might have sunk the 9 ball had you done that. 
I missed it, huh. 
OK, now it's my turn. 
W-What the?! The ball hopped! 
That was a jump shot. 
It's a technique used to leap over an obstructing ball to hit the target behind it. 
Wow... You're as awesome as always, Maria. 
Heheh, you can learn it too if you practice. 
More power... and shoot! 
Yeah! The 9 ball didn't go in, but I was able to sink number 8! 
Good job, Captain. Your form in your arms was good, too. 
Thanks for your advice, Maria. 
OK, now it's my turn. 
W-What the?! The ball hopped! 
That was a jump shot. 
It's a technique used to leap over an obstructing ball to hit the target behind it. 
Wow... You're as awesome as always, Maria. 
Heheh, you can learn it too if you practice. 
Oh... Oh no. I was so nervous, I couldn't shoot it. 
No need to be so nervous. Try to shoot without too much thought. 
It's just a game, so it's all right if you had fun. 
Y-You're right, Maria. Thanks. 
For example, you can shoot like this. 
W-What the?! The ball hopped! 
That was a jump shot. 
It's a technique used to leap over an obstructing ball to hit the target behind it. 
Wow... You're as awesome as always, Maria. 
Ahah. Usually I don't make shots like that. 
You should try to play for fun, without any fear of failure. 
Yeah, got it. Thanks, Maria. 
I ended up losing to you, but I had fun anyways. 
If you don't let your mind open up, you won't be able to have any fun. 
I think this summer trip will be a good way for everyone to recuperate. 
Yeah... 
Now then, it's time for me to leave, Captain. 
If you'd like, perhaps we can play billiards again. 
Of course. I'll beat you next time, Maria. 
I'm looking forward to it. Please come again to this game room later on. 
I'll have to ask Maria to teach me billiards again later on. 
I'm sure that I can win against her someday. 
No one's in here, huh. 
I wonder if everyone is busy preparing things for the trip... 
Iris... Is she inside? 
So Iris's nameplate is shaped like Jean-Paul... 
I better check another room, I guess. 
It's Ogami. Are you there, Iris? 
Huh, Mon frere? Yaay! Welcome! 
It's unlocked, come on in. 
OK, then. Excuse me... 
Are you done packing, Iris? 
Yeah. I started yesterday and I'm almost done... 
But I still have to finish my math homework and I don't know how to solve it... 
What should I do, Mon Frère? 
I'll help you. 
How about you do it later, after the trip? 
I'll help you. 
Really? Yaay! You're really kind, Mon Frère! 
OK then, please teach me. 
Hahaha. OK, you can count on me. 
How about you do it later, after the trip? 
But won't I end up just thinking about the homework the whole trip? 
I want to finish it before I go on a fun vacation like that. 
Uh... 
I know! Why don't you help me study like before, Mon Frère! 
Huh? Me? 
It's a deal! Please teach me, Mon Frère! 
Oh, boy... OK, then. 
I see... Now that's a problem. 
I know! Why don't you help me study like before, Mon Frère! 
Huh? Me? 
Please help me so I can have fun on the trip! Please? 
Oh, boy... OK, then. 
I don't really get these times tables… 
I see, that makes sense. We have our own system for times tables in Japan. 
I imagine it must be tough for you to learn, since you were born in France. 
Well, I think I remember some of them. 
35, 15... <br> 36, 18... <br> 37... <br> Uh, what was it again? 
It's 21. 
It's 24. 
It's 27. 
37, 21. <br> 3 times 7 equals 21. 
You're right! That was awesome, Mon Frère! 
37, 24. <br> 3 times 7 equals 24. 
OK... Huh? That's not right, Mon Frère. 
The answer sheet says "37, 21." 3 times 7 equals 21. You got it all wrong! 
H-Huh? Sorry, my bad. 
37, 7. <br> 3 times 7 equals 27. 
OK... Huh? That's not right, Mon Frère. 
The answer sheet says "37, 21." 3 times 7 equals 21. You got it all wrong! 
H-Huh? Sorry, my bad. 
Huh? My mind went blank after you asked so suddenly. 
Hmm... Oh, there's an answer written here, it's 21. 
Oh, that's right! 3 times 7 equals 21! 
You should have answered sooner. That's not cool, Mon Frère! 
Mon Frère, how should I memorize times tables? 
Please give me some tips. 
Ways to memorize times tables, huh? Hm... 
Use marbles. 
Use repetition. 
Write them on paper and pin it to wall. 
Iris, do you have any marbles? 
Yeah. Here you go. 
Let's create groups of three marbles. If we have 6 in each group, there's 18 marbles. 7 makes it 21. 
So each time you add one to each group, it means you add three more marbles. 
It's hard if you just memorize the answer, so it'll be easier to understand by imagining this, right? 
You're right! 15, 18, 21, 24... Each of them adds three marbles! 
Thanks a lot, Mon Frère! I got it right away! 
The only way is to memorize them by saying the times table out loud repeatedly. 
35, 15... <br> 36, 18... <br> 37, 21.. 
By continuing to say it out loud, you'll be able to recite it from memory. 
Oh, so it's like memorizing the script for our plays. I'll try it! 
The only way is to look at it constantly to memorize the answers. 
Write them on paper and put it on something that you always see. You'll remember them before you know it. 
Oooh! You're so smart, Mon Frère! 
I'll put this on my door so I can memorize them! 
Huh... What is the best way to memorize them? 
I guess it's just like Kaede said... 
...the only way is to say them out loud a lot. 
Thanks a ton, Mon Frère! I got to finish my homework before our trip! 
Your times tables are very important, Iris. You'll forget them if you don't keep practicing. 
It'll be fine! I already memorized it! 
Come on, let's go outside! 
OK, let's go. 
OK, let's go. 
Make sure you review it later. 
OK, let's go. I want to check up on everyone else, too. 
Yay! OK, let's go, Mon Frère. Quick! 
Just so we're clear, you have to keep practicing them, OK? 
O-OK, got it. I'll do that once we get back from our trip. 
C'mon, Mon Frère, we have to hurry, it'll be time to go soon! 
He-Hey, hey... Don't go so fast, Iris! 
Thanks a lot for helping me, Mon Frère! 
OK, I'm gonna go now. Bye-bye! 
Hahaha. She ended up running off fast as a bullet. Looks like she's in quite a good mood. 
Alrighty, let's check up on everyone else. 
Iris... Is she inside? 
So Iris's nameplate is shaped like Jean-Paul... 
I better check another room, I guess. 
There's no response. Looks like she's already went out. 
I wonder if Orihime is inside. 
The name plate has a simple design, but it sure looks classy. 
Let's go check another room. 
Orihime, are you there? 
U... Uh... 
Mmm... Zzz... Zzz... 
Is she still sleeping? 
Shout to wake her up. 
Open the door by force. 
Leave her. 
Heeey, it's almost 10 o'clock, Orihime! 
Mmmm... Uh... So annoying... 
You're going to be left behind if you oversleep! 
...Late? The trip...? 
Huh?! It's... It's already this late?! 
Hey, now... You're gonna be late if you don't hurry. 
Ensign, you saved me. Just this once, thank you. 
Never mind that, just change your clothes, quick! 
(Oh boy. That would have been terrible if I hadn't woken her up.) 
(I have to force my way into her room!) 
Uh...? 
...Wa! W-Who's there!? 
Oh, you're finally awake. It's me, Ogami. 
E-Ensign?! Do you intend to become a criminal at last?! 
Don't break into peoples' rooms!! 
N-No! The clock! Look at the time! 
Huh?! It's... It's already this late?! 
You would've overslept if I hadn't done that. 
But... But even so, there must be better ways to wake me up than that! 
I need to change, so get out! 
Oh dear... This'll be quite the ruckus just before the trip. 
She'll just get angry at me if I wake her up, so let's leave her be. 
Let sleeping dogs lie... I'll just head to another room. 
Uh... Should I or should I not wake her up? 
Well, she'll eventually wake up on her own, so let's just leave for now. 
I wonder if Orihime is inside. 
The name plate has a simple design, but it sure looks classy. 
Let's go check another room. 
Orihime, are you awake? 
Y-Yes... I also somehow managed to get changed. 
Thanks... Sorry for taking up your time. 
Don't slack off! 
Be more careful next time. 
Did something happen? 
Don't slack off and oversleep, Orihime! 
I-It's not like I overslept on purpose! 
You made in time, but be more careful next time. 
It's vexing to hear that warning... But this time, I suppose you're right. 
This doesn't seem like you. Did something happen? 
Hearing your concern for me is humiliating, but I suppose there's no helping things. 
... 
Never once did I ever think you'd have to wake me up, Ensign. 
I hate Japanese men... 
As much as I hate... waking up early. 
Having a type of person I hate making me do something that I hate... 
But I might have missed the trip otherwise... 
Should I be happy or angry... I don't know anymore. 
W-Well the important thing is that you're not going to be late. 
I still have some things to prepare, so I need to go. 
Boy, looks like she was able to make it on time. 
There's no time left! I'm heading out first! 
Boy, looks like she was able to make it on time. 
I wonder if Orihime is inside. 
The name plate has a simple design, but it sure looks classy. 
Let's go check another room. 
It's Ogami... 
I'm still getting ready! Don't talk to me! 
(She'll just get angry if I keep asking. I better leave her alone.) 
I wonder if Orihime is inside. 
The name plate has a simple design, but it sure looks classy. 
Let's go check another room. 
Looks like she's already gone on to the entrance to meet up with everyone. 
There's not much time. I should get going too. 
This is Kaede's room. 
I better check another room, I guess. 
It's Ogami. Are you there, Kaede? 
Oh, Ogami. The door's unlocked, come in. 
Right. Pardon me. 
Hi, Ogami. Did you need something? 
Have a chat. 
Ask about Ayame. 
Nothing in particular. 
It's very sunny outside. At this rate, it'll be hot again by afternoon. 
That's true, it is the height of summer after all. 
That reminds me, Kohran said that at 9:30 she was going to pick tomatoes in the courtyard. 
Everyone else seems busy packing for the trip. 
Perhaps they're still inside their own rooms. 
I see... 
Make sure to bring your Cinematron along, Ogami. 
Y-Yes, ma'am! 
I would like to hear your story, Kaede... If that's OK with you. 
Why of course. Hmm... What should I talk about? 
No... Nothing in particular. 
I just wanted to see you. 
Oh, is that so? I'm happy to hear that, Ogami. 
Well then, I have to excuse myself. 
You're always welcome here. 
All right. Well, I should get going. Please excuse me. 
I'm glad I could talk with Kaede. I'll visit her again next time. 
This is Kaede's room. 
I better check another room, I guess. 
It's Ogami. Are you there, Kaede? 
Oh, Ogami. 
I'm sorry, but I have to write these reports. 
I see. Then I'll see you later. 
Sorry, Ogami. Let's have a nice talk some other time. 
Phew... Being in my own room is quite relaxing. 
Now, what should I do... 
Call someone. 
Grab Cinematron. 
Get back to work. 
Call someone. 
Get back to work. 
I know, why don't I make a call? 
Oh, right. I need to bring my Cinematron along. 
...There. Now I can contact the theater in case something goes wrong. 
Let's do this later. I still have other stuff to do. 
I wonder if Reni's inside. 
It seems that Reni is not here. 
It's just a piece of paper from a notebook. I suppose that's fitting for someone like Reni. 
OK, let's check another room. 
I wonder if Kohran is inside. 
There's no response. Looks like she's in another room. 
A gear-shaped nameplate, huh? It's just Kohran's style. 
Let's check another room. 
Nobody's here. I wonder if everyone's busy preparing for the trip. 
Guess tea lessons with Sumire are postponed for now. 
Perhaps I should visit her room, just in case. 
Maybe everyone's still their rooms. 
Nobody's here... 
Guess I better check another room. 
We'll be having our autumn performance next month. 
I hope these seats will be full of guests like our last play. 
The theater's on summer break, so no one's here. 
Let's check another room. 
Another sunny day. 
I hope the weather will stay like this when we reach Atami. 
No one's here. 
There's not much time left. Let's check another room. 
Everyone's getting ready for the trip, so no one would be coming here. 
Well, let's check another room. 
Nobody's here. 
Ah, Ogami. 
Sakura, are you hurt or something? 
No, I was just thinking that we should bring some medicine along for the trip. 
Do you need me to bring anything along? 
Anti-motion sickness pills. 
Disinfectant. 
Anti-motion sickness pills. 
Disinfectant. 
Love potion. 
I think bringing some anti-motion sickness pills for our trip to Atami would be good. 
OK. I'll bring some of those. 
It's weird to hear you say that seeing as you're always piloting a Koubu. 
People may get injured at the beach, so it'd be nice to have some disinfectant. 
I agree. I'll bring the first aid kit, then. 
Let's see... How about a love potion? 
Huh? L-Love potion? 
Hahaha, just kidding. 
Oh... That was a surprise. 
... 
But, Ogami... Hypothetically, if the potion did existed, who would you use it on? 
...Huh? 
N-No! It's nothing! 
Uh... I don't really need anything. 
Are you sure? In any case, I'll bring some aspirin. 
There. Medicine's all ready. 
I'm going to leave, Ogami. See you later. 
Yeah. See you later. 
OK, I should get going, too. 
Looks like nobody's here, just the smell of disinfectant. 
I should check another room. I wonder if everyone's finished preparing for the trip. 
Oh! Mornin', Chief. 
Morning, Kohran. You been working on our Koubu this morning? 
Hiya, Chief. 
Hi, Kohran. Are you doing maintenance on our Koubu? 
Yeah. Since we're gonna leave the theater for our trip... 
I wanted to make some adjustments so they'll be ready to deploy in an instant. 
Keep up the good work. 
Aren't you overthinking things? 
That outfit looks cool. 
Keep up the good work, Kohran. You're the one who understands them the most. 
Thanks, Chief. Hearing that from you lifts my spirits. 
Leave these Koubu to me. I'll make sure they can move out in a jiffy if we need 'em to. 
Kohran, aren't you overthinking things? 
We're on a summer break, how about you try relaxing for a bit? 
Ya got it wrong, Chief. War knows no rest. 
And it's precisely because of breaks like this that need to keep checking up on them. 
I-I see... 
Kohran, you look good in that outfit. 
Wha-What're ya sayin' all out of the blue? That's come out of nowhere. 
These are just work clothes. It's nothing compared to the gorgeous outfits everyone else wears. 
That's what I meant. You're good just the way your are. I think you look really nice in that outfit. 
R-Really? Thank, Chief... 
C-Chief, say something, now I'm getting embarrassed. 
Uh... Oh, right. I was lost in thought. 
Ahahaha... You're really a carefree person, Chief. 
Chief, have you ever learned the story of how people got the idea to make Koubu? 
The story? No, I can't say I have. 
This is a tale dating all the way back to the American Civil War 60 years ago. 
The Confederate Army of the south was using black magic during their campaign against the north. 
The Union army had no means of defending against their sorcery. People were being wiped out in droves. 
But after one devastating battle, a single survivor was found! 
A lone baby, hidden inside a tractor. 
It was found that the tractor was made with a cheap metal alloy of iron and lead. 
That alloy, it turned out, had the power to defend against their dark powers. They named it Celesteel. 
Celesteel... 
The reason our Koubu can fight demons is because they're made from Celesteel. 
Even the basement of the theater is made using the stuff. 
I see... So that's how it came to be. 
As for Celesteel, think my story was good enough to "sell" you on it? Ahahahaha! 
That was hilarious! 
Huh... What do you mean? 
That was hilarious! 
F-For real?! I kinda forced it, though. 
No need to pretend it was funny. I don't like seeing someone lie. 
You just need to retort it when it bores you. 
No... I really thought it was funny. 
But, I'll keep in mind about doing retorts. 
Huh... What do you mean? 
I was trying to throw a pun about Celesteel. Doesn't work, huh? 
Uh... 
Chief, you should just play along, you need to go "say what?!" to lame jokes. 
It'd be awkward for me if no one retorts it. 
I see... I'll keep that in mind. 
I'll make sure to humor you again. No biggie. 
Ah, dear me... Didn't work, huh? 
Ah, s-sorry. I was quite dumbfounded right there. 
It wasn't funny after all. No need to force your laugh, but at least retort, would ya? 
It'd be awkward for me if no one retorts it. 
I see... I'll keep that in mind. 
OK now, I have to do one more thing before the trip. 
One more thing? 
Today I'm gonna pick some tomatoes that I planted in the courtyard. 
I'm going to start at 9:30, so why don't you come over and take a look? Later, then. 
Picking tomatoes, huh... Sounds fun. 
I'll have to swing by the courtyard at 9:30. 
Kohran's not here. I she went off to do something. 
Anyway, no one's here, so I'll just check another room. 
Looks like no one's around, only the Koubu and Eisenkleid. 
Oh well, guess I should go to another room. 
Huh? Looks like someone's in the bathroom. 
These clothes... These are Kohran's. 
T-That means... Kohran's in the bath... 
My body is moving towards the bathroom on its own... 
Go back outside. 
Oh no... My body is moving towards the bathroom on its own... 
(Kohran...) 
(She must have taken off her glasses, so maybe she won't notice me...) 
...! 
U-Uh oh! 
Remain calm. 
Run away. 
Remain calm. 
I'm sure she won't notice me since she took off her glasses... 
Ch-Chief!? 
Eh!? Your glasses... Are you wearing them!? 
Get outta here, Chief! Just get out, quick! 
S-Sorry! I'm getting out! 
... 
My apologies, Kohran. It was an accident. 
Unlike the showers, this bathroom is huge, so I have to wear my glasses. 
Now I realize I made a wise choice. 
Sorry. I'll be more careful. 
Well, since you apologized so earnestly, I'll forgive you this one time. 
Do that again and I'll never let you forget it. 
Phew... Somehow I got away without getting yelled at. 
Huh. So now she take baths with her glasses on. 
(I gotta get out of here before she sees me!) 
Phew... I think I got away before she realized it was me. 
Had I'd been just a moment slower, I might not have made it. That was too close... 
Ah... Uhm... I... 
Ch-Chief!? 
Eh!? Your glasses... are you wearing them!? 
Get outta here, Chief! Just get out, quick! 
S-Sorry! I'm getting out! 
... 
My apologies, Kohran. It was an accident. 
Unlike the showers, this bathroom is huge, so I have to wear my glasses. 
Now I realize I made a wise choice. 
Sorry. I'll be more careful. 
Well, since you apologized so earnestly, I'll forgive you this one time. 
Do that again and I'll never let you forget it. 
Phew... Somehow I got away without getting yelled at. 
Huh. So now she take baths with her glasses on. 
She must be cleaning herself up after working on the Koubu so much. 
I better not bother her and walk away. 
OK. Looks like she didn't notice. 
Now, let's go to another room. 
Phew, washing up after a long maintenance session sure hits the spot. 
Well, time to finish. 
(Ack! Her glasses... She's still wearing them!) 
(I gotta get out of here before she sees me!) 
Phew... I think I got away before she realized it was me. 
Had I'd been just a moment slower, I might not have made it. That was too close... 
Hiya, Chief. 
H-Hey, Kohran. Uh... Are you finished with your bath? 
Yup. Having a bath after doing maintenance sure feels great. 
I cleaned up and changed my clothes. Now I'm ready to get back to it. 
I'm gonna pick some tomatoes. See ya, Chief. 
Relaxing in a bath after finishing a task sure is the best. 
Let's not doze off. I should head to the next room. 
Looks like no one's taking a bath right now. 
Well, we'll have a hot spring in Atami, anyway. 
...Captain. 
Oh, it's you, Reni. What are you doing here? 
I'm researching the geography of our destination in Atami. 
Our enemies may strike while we're there. 
Way to go. 
Impressive, but rest comes first. 
Aren't you overthinking things? 
Thinking of combat even as we're going on vacation. Good idea, Reni. 
...Is that so? It's just the natural thing to do. 
I'm happy you're not neglecting that stuff, but rest is more important. 
Our summer break just started, taking the time to recuperate is important, too. 
...Right. I know. 
Reni, aren't you overthinking things? 
After all, we're going on vacation. Forget about combat and take a rest. 
...Battle doesn't go on vacation. 
Uh... 
... 
The resort is located near both the ocean and mountains. 
Our enemies might not attack during our vacation, but we cannot afford to let our guard down. 
Reni, you're being as cautious as always. 
Just because we're on summer break, doesn't mean we can let our guard down. 
I hope we won't have to use this room during our break. 
There's no use in worrying about it. Let's just enjoy the trip as much as we can. 
Wha... What's that sound?! 
...!? Looks like it came from behind this wall. 
And it seems that... It stopped when I got here. 
Check the wall. 
Pretend to leave. 
Leave. 
I'm gonna check the wall. 
... 
... 
Uh... Doesn't seem to be anything out of place. 
(OK... I'll pretend to leave.) 
That's weird, I thought I heard something. Was it my imagination? 
Can't do anything about that, better check out another room. 
... 
(Just as I thought...) 
Who's there!? 
Ugh... What's happening here? 
Hmm... Maybe there's construction going on, I don't know... 
I'm curious, but I don't have time to find out... Let's check another room. 
...The sound is gone. 
Hmm... Was it just my imagination? 
No one seems to working out before the trip. 
Guess no one's here. Let's head to another room. 
Now that it's midsummer, maybe there's a chance I'll go swimming in the pool. 
I can swim to my heart's content during the trip. 
No one's here. 
No one's swimming here. We're all going to swimm at the beach, after all. 
Smells like nice soap in here. Maybe it's because Kohran just took a bath. 
There's no use in standing idly by here. Let's move to another room. 
We're gonna have a bath in Atami, so there's no need to take a one right now. 
Let's just head to another room. 
The heat from the steam processor makes this room hotter than the others. 
Ugh, I'm starting to sweat. What am I doing in this place anyway? 
...Ah!! 10 o'clock snuck up on me! 
I'm gonna get left behind if I don't hurry to the entrance! 
Hey, everyone. Thanks for waiting. 
Oh, you're right on time. I'm sure everyone will be here soon. 
Oh, sorry for the wait, Boss, Kaede! 
Man, I was rushing to get here, too. Glad I made in time. 
Sakura and Orihime are also here. 
All members present here, Kaede. 
Thank you. 
I-I'm sorry, came a bit late. 
It's not good to be tardy, Ogami. 
You're making me worry about how the trip will go. 
Yes, I apologize... 
Here, your Cinematron. You mustn't forget it. 
Ah! I-I'm truly sorry!! 
Anyway, isn't Atami quite far away? 
How do we get there? Don't tell me we're going in the Soaring Whale? 
Ahahaha! We'd get there in the blink of an eye if we flew in that. 
But then the higher-ups would give me an earful for that! 
Then how do we get to Atami? 
Let's go outside. I got a ride ready for you. 
Wooow! What a big car! 
This a steam bus. I reserved it exclusively for your trip. 
Hooo boy. A private bus, sounds fancy. 
Well done, Mr. Yoneda. What a grand idea. 
Gwahahahaha! I told you I'd take care of everything. 
OK, everyone. Have fun! 
Please watch over everyone, Ogami. 
We'll be off! 
Are you sure the theater will be fine? 
Yes, we'll be off! Please take care of the theater in our stead! 
Yes, you can count on us. 
But... Are you sure the theater will be safe? 
Are you sure the theater will be safe? 
... 
Are you worried about the theater, Ogami? 
Y-Yeah... I'd be lying if I said I wasn't. 
Bah, no need to worry. 
You see, we already got ourselves a bunch of powerful helpers. 
Huh? Helpers? 
Hey boys, come on out and show yourselves! 
Imperial Assault Troupe, Rose Division, reporting for duty! 
R-Rose Division!? 
Wh-Who are these people...? 
These men are the Rose Division. They'll be watching over the theater while you're all away. 
Pleased to meet you, Ensign Ogami. I'm Seiryuin Kotone... 
Captain of the Rose Division, a secret unit all for beauty and love. 
Ichirooo! I've always wanted to meet you! Let me give you a kiss! 
U-Uwaaahh! Please don't! 
Hey now, Yokihiko! You need to introduce yourself first. 
Oh, dear me. Sorry, forgive me for that. 
I'm Yokihiko Ota, also of the Rose Division. 
Now, Kiku. You haven't said hello yet, right? 
Yes! A-Ah, uhm... Hello... Ogami... 
I'm... Kikunojo Oka, n-nice to meet you. 
Heh. So, how does it feel to meet the esteemed Ensign Ogami, Kikunojo? 
S-Stop, Kotone. It's... Uhm... He's nice... 
What's with this group of weirdos? 
Now, now. Despite their appearances, these guys are some of the Imperial Army's finest. 
Hey, aren't you going to say hello, Ogami? 
Oh... U-Uhm... 
H-Hello... 
I'm Ichiro Ogami. 
H-Hello... 
You guys are fabulous. 
H-Hello... Nice to meet you... 
Myyy, aren't you nervous right there, Ichiro? Ooh-ho, how cuuute! 
Oh... What a shy person, I can't help but love that. 
Nice to... meet you too... 
I'm Ichiro Ogami. Nice to meet you, everyone. 
Ah, lovely! How gallant! Oh, I'm yours to command!! 
That's the refined manner and kindness one should expect from a naval ensign. Even men would fall for that. 
You're so cool, Ogami. 
Well, aren't you all fabulous. I'm surprised. 
Smooth words, Ichiro! Let me kiss you! 
N-No thanks! 
Oh, you called us "fabulous." I'm so happy to hear that. I could cry... 
Ah, you sure have a sense for beauty. Just what we expect from the captain of the Flower Division. 
... 
Aha! Seems that you're so mesmerized by my looks that you've become speechless. 
Please, Mr. Kotone! Don't be so full of yourself. 
He must be mesmerized by my physical beauty and stature! 
W-Wait up! I... 
Oho, you're blushing! So innocent, Ichiro. How cute! 
Apparently he's been captivated by each of our beauty. 
Is... Is that so?! I'm... so happy. 
S-Sorry, Mr. Yoneda, I need to ask you something, just to make sure... 
Ahh, yes. Despite what first impressions may lead you to believe, these fellows are all men. 
Huuuh? But why are they acting so ladylike?! 
Iris, there are all kinds of people in this world. 
Ohoho, there are many like them in the courts of Europe. 
But, to leave the theater in their care... 
Will it really be OK? 
Whaaat? Don't worry. As I said, they may not look it, but these men are some of the army's finest soldiers. 
Affirmative. We shall protect the theater and General Yoneda. 
So please, enjoy your vacation! 
P-Please... Have a safe trip... 
Fareweeeell! 
(Uh... Instead of taking it easy, why am I getting more worried?) 
Sorry, Ogami, but each customer is only allowed to purchase one photo at a time. 
I see. That's too bad... 
My apologies, Ogami, but each customer is only allowed to purchase one photo at a time. 
Oh, really? That's too bad...

Ayame and I almost never lived in the same household, even though we were sisters. 
Eh...? 
It's not so unusual, given our lineage. We have less a "family tree" and more a "family wisteria." 
Yet, I still knew that she was the type of person that would sacrifice her own well-being for others... 
Carrying everyone's burdens by herself... 
That's why, when I received the news that she had passed away, I made up my mind. 
I want to carry on her will. I want to protect the capital, just like she did. 
And for my own sake, too. 
...I suppose that's all I have to say. 
You know, Ogami, I came here to work of my own volition. 
To protect the peace of this city, and to cherish our audience's smiles. 
I'm sure you feel the same, Ogami. 
Yes, of course. 
So let's both do our best. 
For my sister... <br> For everyone... 
Yes ma'am! 
Well, today I will tell you about the Anti-Kouma Corps. 
The Anti-Kouma Corps was the army's predecessor to the Imperial Assault Troupe. 
Ikki Yoneda, Kazuma Shinguji, Shinnosuke Yamazaki, and... Ayame Fujieda. 
A special unit, comprising only those four, formed to defend the capital from evil. 
Seven years ago... A Kouma appeared in Nihonbashi. 
Even though it was just a single Kouma, the military and police were powerless against it. 
However, the Anti-Kouma Corps managed to seal the Kouma away, albeit at great cost. 
That incident made the government painfully aware of the need to defend against such evil. 
As a result, the Imperial Assault Troupe as you know it was born. 
The troupe is the fruit of the Anti-Kouma Corps' will. 
And, of the four members, only General Yoneda is still alive today. 
For the sake of those four, who protected the people from evil... We have to keep fighting. 
... 
Now then, today I'll tell you about Ayame's travels. 
In order to recruit members for the Flower Division, Ayame traveled around the world. 
She searched for suitable candidates for the Flower Division, girls with powerful spiritual abilities. 
She sent me letters from various countries. America, France, China... 
Whenever she did, I must be honest, I envied her. 
I see, so she did all that... 
Those same candidates make up the Flower Division we have now. 
And you know what, Ogami? Recently, I've been thinking... 
The people Ayame chose truly were the best people for the job. That includes you. 
Kaede... 
Ayame entrusted the Flower Division to me, so I'll continue to give it my all. 
Don't give up. Even in the hardest of times, remember to never give up, Ogami. 
Yes ma'am! I will do all I can to meet your expectations! 
Now then, today I'll tell you about Ayame and Major Yamazaki. 
Both Ayame and Major Yamazaki were members of the Imperial Assault Troupe's predecessor, the Anti-Kouma Corps. 
Major Yamazaki was a brilliant scientist who came up with the foundational designs for Spirit Armor... 
And they say he had a stronger sense of justice than most. 
Anyone could see that Ayame and Major Yamazaki were deeply in love with each other... 
But their relationship crumbled when the Kouma War started. 
What could have possibly caused that? 
Now, this is pure conjecture... 
But it seems that during their battles with the Kouma, Major Yamazaki became obsessed with certain questions. 
What are these demons?" "Why do they exist?" 
And "how are they so powerful?" 
General Yoneda noticed that Major Yamazaki had changed, and he warned him many times. 
But, in the end, no one could change his mind. 
Not even Ayame... 
When the Kouma War ended seven years ago, Major Yamazaki went missing. 
And then in our recent battles, he appeared again as Cerulean Satan. 
Justice by power... <br> Rule through evil... 
Perhaps that was his conclusion... 
Back when he appeared in front of the theater six months ago... 
I wonder what Cerulean Satan... No, what Major Yamazaki was trying to tell us... 
...
