Come here, Iris. You can sit at my desk. 
OK! 
Wow, your desk is so big, Mon Frère. 
Hahaha, it does look big. I don't really use it, though. 
Now... How should we write your letter? 
Uhm... You can tell me what you want to say... 
...and I'll write it in French. 
OK, got it. 
OK, Mon Frère. First, we need you to say hello to Papa and Mama. 
Greetings... Let's start with this introduction. 
Dear Mr. and Mrs. Chateaubriand, I hope you're doing well. My name is Ichiro Ogami, and I'm..." 
Captain of the Flower Division. 
Iris's lover. 
The theater's ticket puncher. 
...the captain of the Flower Division in the Imperial Assault Troupe." 
Ichiro Ogami... the captain of... Assault Troupe." 
Is that too formal? 
Nuh-huh. I think it's nice to write like how you usually say things. 
...Iris's lover." 
Tee-hee! You're so bold, Mon Frère! 
I already told Papa and Mama that you're my boyfriend in my letters... 
...so don't worry about it. 
I... I see... 
...the ticket puncher at the theater where Iris works at." 
I think putting a joke there would be nice. What do you think? 
Hehe! I wrote the same thing in my previous letter! 
It's funny, so we should write that again! 
... 
...What's wrong, Mon Frère? 
Hm... How should I introduce myself? I'm not sure. 
I'll write it for you! 
Mon Frère is the... of..." 
Hey now, what are you writing? 
Ehehe, it's-a-se-cret! 
Now, what should we say next? 
Can you write something about me, please? 
OK, let's write something about you. Let's see, um... 
It is my conviction that you must be worried about Iris." 
It is my conviction..." Mon Frère, what does "con-vic-tion" mean? 
Hmm. Let's replace it with "I'm sure", then. 
Got it. So, what's next? 
Let's see... "Iris is..." 
Doing OK. 
A vital asset of the Flower Division. 
Being selfish and bothering everyone. 
Doing OK. 
A vital asset of the Flower Division. 
She went on a rampage today. 
Doing OK. 
Really cute. 
Selfish and troubling everyone. 
Doing OK. 
Really cute. 
She went on a rampage today. 
Iris is doing OK." 
Should I also put you're quite the bundle of energy? 
Whaat? That's how you talk about kids. 
I'm a grown-up, so don't say that! 
Hahaha. Sorry, sorry. 
Iris is doing her best and is a vital asset of the Flower Division." 
Be it onstage or during battle, Iris is a devoted teammate. Please rest assured that she's flourishing here." 
...devoted teammate... rest assured..." 
Ehehehe, thanks for praising me like that, Mon Frère. I'm so happy! 
Iris is very cute." 
Tee-hee! Thank you, Mon Frère! 
Hahaha. I think they might be surprised reading this letter. 
Iris being selfish and troubles everyone." 
I'm not selfish! I don't wanna write that! 
That's what I meant by "being selfish", Iris. 
I need to tell your parents the full story of how you're doing here. 
Oh... Fine.... 
Iris is..." 
Are you sure you wrote that properly? 
Check it yourself! 
Iris is selfish and bothers everyone." 
Today, she went on a rampage in the salon." 
But I wasn't being selfish. I don't wanna write that. 
And I don't wanna make Papa and Mama worried about me... 
I-I see. You're right. 
OK then, let's not write that down. 
Yeah. That's better. 
... 
...What's wrong, Mon Frère? 
Hmm... I'm still thinking about what should I write. 
How about I write, "Iris is doing good"? 
R-Right. I think that'd be nice. 
OK, now for the last part. "I will do my best to..." 
... 
protect Iris. 
make Iris happy. 
discipline Iris. 
I will do my best to protect her..." 
...no matter what kind of enemy will be in front of us..." 
...and what problem she will have to face." 
Iris will always be a very important friend to me." 
That should do it, don't you think? 
Thank you, Mon Frère... 
I'll also do my best! 
I will do my best to make her happy." 
I'm still unsure whether my efforts will be enough, but I will work as hard as I can to make that happen." 
It's a bit short, but... what do you think? 
Thank you, Mon Frère... 
I'm sure Papa and Mama will be happy, too. 
I will do my best to discipline her." 
That sounds like I'm being a bad kid! 
And I'm not a kid anymore! 
Uh... OK. Let's change it to, "I will do my best to look after her." 
Got it. "I will... look after her." 
I haven't decided what should I write yet... 
...but the point is, I'll do my best for your sake. 
...OK, got it! 
I'll write it just like that. I'm sure Papa and Mama will get it! 
...Well now, is this OK? 
Yeah! Thank you, Mon Frère! 
You're welcome. 
Honestly, I think you're doing amazing, Iris. 
Huh? Why do you say that? 
You're living far away from your parents, but you're always cheerful. 
On top of that, you're writing letters like this to tell them that you're doing OK. 
... 
I'm not all that amazing... 
The thing is... I was locked inside a castle for a long time. 
...A castle? 
Yeah... When I was still a kid, I didn't know how to control my power. 
It was hurting other people, so I was always locked up in my room. 
I see... 
All I ever wanted was to go out and play with Papa and Mama... 
...but the only thing I could do was just talk to Jean-Paul and his friends. 
... 
I'm not great or amazing. The truth is... I'm just so lonely. 
Speak kindly to her. 
Cheer her up. 
Speak kindly to her. 
Encourage her. 
Sniff... 
Iris... 
Iris, you've been lonely for a long time. 
I never realized how hard it was for you. 
Sniff... 
I wish I could have been with you back then. 
Sniff... But now we're together, hehe. 
Yeah, now we're together. So, Iris... 
You can cheer up now. I'm with you. 
Mon Frère... 
Cheer up, Iris. A sad face doesn't suit you! 
I-Is that so...? 
That's right. You look so cute when you smile! 
Ehehehe... Are you sure? 
Of course. Besides, you're not alone anymore. 
The Flower Division and I will always be with you. 
Yeah... Thank you, Mon Frère! 
Ehehe, I'll be always together with you! 
Hahaha. You were just crying, but look at you now, beaming from ear to ear. 
Ehehe. It's all good now, right? Because now I'm happy! 
Iris, I need you to listen. 
You were alone back then, but now, you have me and everyone else in the Flower Division. 
You're not alone anymore, all right? 
Mon Frère... 
Sorry, Iris. I can't find the right words to say, but... 
I'll try to look after you as much as I can. 
Mon Frère... 
I can't replace your parents... 
But I can always be by your side. 
We can chat, go out, and play together. 
You're a precious friend to everyone in the Flower Division, not just me. 
We won't let you be alone anymore. 
Mon Frère... 
Phew, it's getting late. Let's get to bed. 
Mon Frère, u-um... Can I ask for one more thing? 
Oh? What is it? 
Can I... sleep in your room tonight? 
Sure, no problem. 
That'll be a problem. 
Sure, no problem. We can share my room. 
Yay! Thank you, Mon Frère! 
That... may be a problem. 
It's fiiine! I won't tell Sakura, OK? 
R-Right... 
U-Uhm... What should I do? 
Oh! Mon Frère, you're blushing! That's cute! 
I won't tell anyone, Mon Frère. I'll just go to sleep right away! Good niiight! 
H-Hey, Iris! 
OK, good night, Mon Frère! 
OK... Good night, Iris. 
Ehehe! This makes me happy... 
... 
Hey, Mon Frère... 
Yes, Iris? 
Let's play together some time... 
OK, I promise. 
A promise is a promise... And Mon Frère, please stay... 
...by my side... always... 
... 
Yes... I'll always be there for you. 
Good night, Iris. 
Uh... It's morning already? 
Zzz... Zzz... 
Iris? Oh yeah, last night she asked to stay in my room. 
Hm... Mmmmmmm... 
Hahaha, what a cute face. She looks so innocent. 
Iris, wake up. It's morning. 
Hmmm... 
...Huh? Mon Frère? 
Yaaaawn... So I was dreaming, huh. 
Morning, Iris. Did you sleep well? 
Yeah! I slept really well! 
Mon Frère, I saw you in my dream! 
Oh... 
What did you dream about? 
I had a dream, too. 
Should I ask for a performance fee? 
What did you dream about? 
I saw you in my dream, too. 
Should I ask for a performance fee? 
What did you dream about? 
Tee-hee, it's a secret! 
OK. Then, was it a nice dream? 
Yeah. A super nice one! 
I think... I had a dream, too. 
You had a dream as well, Mon Frère? What did you dream about? 
Uhm... What was it... 
Huh. I think I forgot. 
You forgot? Aw... I wanted to hear about it. 
What was it like, huh? Should I ask for a performance fee? 
Whaaat!? Mon Frère, you meanie!! 
Hahaha, just kidding. As long it's not a bad dream, that's good enough for me. 
Yeah! Of course it was a good dream! 
Me too. I saw you in my dream last night. 
What? You saw me... in your dream? 
Yeah. I forgot how it went... 
...but the thing I remember most is seeing you. 
Perhaps we shared a dream last night. 
Yeah! I think so, too! That must be it! 
Mon Frère... Do you want to know what I dreamt about? 
I'd like to. But if you tell other people, your dream won't happen in real life. 
What, is that so!? 
Then I won't tell it! I absolutely, absolutely won't tell anyone! 
... 
Thank you, Mon Frère. 
I'm not... lonely anymore. 
...I see. 
Well, let's go for breakfast. 
Yeah! 
It's Sakura! Morning!! 
I-Iris... 
Good morning, Sakura. Looks like it'll be a pleasant morning. 
Ogami... 
Come on, you two! Let's eat breakfast right away! 
You're right. OK, let's eat! 
...Yeah! 
My... Good morning, everyone. 
Oh. You're early today, Ogami. About to have breakfast? 
Good morning, sir. You look sharp today. Are you about to go somewhere? 
Yep, got business with the Ministry of the Army. Saki's coming along, too. 
Iris, how about you ask the manager to help send your letter? 
A letter, huh? Yeah, I'll send it for you. 
Really? Are you sure, Uncle?! 
Why not? It's no problem to me, my dear Iris. 
Thank you so much, Uncle! 
The alarm?! 
It's early in the morning, but our enemies are still coming, huh. 
Ogami, I still need to head to the ministry, so please take care of the Flower Division. 
Understood, sir! 
Iris, I'll make sure to send this letter, so don't worry. 
Yeah! I'm counting on you, Uncle! 
Yeah, you can count on me. I'm off... 
Uh-oh. 
What's wrong, sir? 
Oh, my shoelace just snapped is all. Ah, it's not a big deal. 
Oh my. I'm afraid that's a sign of bad luck. 
We're heading out for our mission, Commander. 
OK. Watch yourself out there! 
Yeah! I'll do my best for today! 
It's time to move out! Let's go, Ogami, Iris! 
The Imperial Assault Troupe, Flower Division has assembled! 
Where's the enemy appeared at? 
According to intel, Shibuya. 
The Hex Mechs seem to be carrying a lot of material. 
If it's Shibuya, we can use the Thunderstrike to get there quick! 
Thunderstrike? What's that? 
It's an underground train for transporting Koubu, and the pride of Imperial Assault Troupe. 
It's a bullet train, so it can take us to our destination in no time. 
What do you think the enemy is planning with the all that material they're moving in? 
They have to be assembling something! 
We should wipe them out immediately while they're still busy! 
We could also wait and see what it is they're up to before deploying. 
(Hmm... Which strategy should we use?) 
Destroy enemies immediately. 
Wait and collect intel. 
We'll destroy the enemy immediately. We're not gonna just let the Black Demon Society do as they please! 
We'll also destroy all the material they've gathered. 
We better hold back and wait for more intel. 
We still don't know their objective yet, so we shouldn't make any careless moves. 
The troupe's intelligence team, the Moon Division, is currently doing recon for us. 
... 
We just received word from the Moon Division. The enemy's objective is... to build a forward operating base. 
So you just need to destroy those. Seems the material that must be destroyed has already been marked, so focus on those. 
Understood, destroying the marked supplies. 
Roger! 
Mon Frère, give the order, please! 
Imperial Assault Troupe, move out! 
We're headed out, Iris! 
Imperial Assault Troupe, we're moving out! Our destination is Shibuya! 
Let's do our best, Ogami! 
It's a perfect chance to move my body before breakfast! 
Preparation for sortie, completed. 
I absolutely won't lose, today! 
Mon Frère is with me, so I can't lose! 
We're going out, Iris. Are you ready? 
Yeah! I'm ready! 
Are you ready too, Mon Frère? Don't leave anything behind, OK? 
Hahaha. OK, we're moving out! 
Yaaaawn... Crap, that was quite the yawn. 
Ogami, don't tell me you were pulling an all-nighter. 
Actually, Sakura, last night Mon Frère was... 
Aaaaah! Iris, hold it! 
Oh... right. It's supposed to be a secret. 
...? 
A-Anyway, Imperial Assault Troupe, move out! 
OK. I'm done with my business. And I just sent out Iris's letter, too. 
I'm worried about this Black Demon Society business. Well, Ogami is taking care of them. I'm sure he has it handled. 
Now, back to the theater. 
D-Don't try to stop me. I-I need to... get back... to the... theater... 
My precious children... They're all... waiting for me there... 
I... I can't die... not like this!
