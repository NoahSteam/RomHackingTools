Wowwww… <br> There's so many pillars…
It would seem we've reached the hall of pillars.
Father… <br> He told us to cut all these pillars down.
Those pillars must be controlling all the energy going through Musashi.
I've got a bad feeling about this… Let's get this over with, quick!
Stop right there, maggots!
Kyogoku!
Musashi is absorbing the energy from the suppressed city…
And now, I shall bring down the hammer on this false capital!
I will not let you interfere!
Come forth, Kouma!
Wait, Kouma?!
Wh-What are they doing here?! We performed the Rite of Four Swords!
The power of the Rite of Four Swords amounts to nothing within Musashi! Ahahahaha!
This place… shall be your grave!
Captain!
Yeah, I got it! Now's the time to combine our power!
