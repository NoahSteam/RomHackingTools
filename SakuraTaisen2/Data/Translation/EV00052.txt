Oh, for heaven's sake, Ensign!
I thought I had told you how much I despise Japanese men!
Orihime… I understand that you're not fond of Japanese men.
But we're in the middle of a battle. I can't fight properly if I have to worry about keeping my distance from you…
Could you please try and put up with it for just a little longer?
*sigh*… I suppose I haven't a choice. Well, it will be fine for a short while.
In that case, I will allow you to come near - but only for now.
Th-Thanks for understanding, Orihime.
