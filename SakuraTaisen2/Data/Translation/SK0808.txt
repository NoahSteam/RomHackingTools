Whoa... The sun's rising over Tokyo! 
It's really... really beautiful... 
Boss, we finally did it! We won! 
We protected the capital from the Black Demon Society! 
...Yeah! 
OK, everyone, let's head back. 
Back to the theater, our home. 
OK! Flower Division, returning to the Grand Imperial Theater! 
Roger! 
We finally got back to our Imperial Theater... 
It's only been a day, but it already feels like it's been ages. 
Ogami, thank you for your hard work. 
Bringing all the Flower Division together, you have my gratitude. 
No, it was nothing... 
Seems the Taisho Restoration Army's coup has finally been put down. 
With that, Tokyo is calm once again. Great job, Ogami. 
Th-Thank you very much! 
Ogami... Truly, thank you for everything. 
Because of you, and everyone else, I can continue to be here! 
That's right. Let's keep doing our best, Sakura. 
Living a bright and happy life is the best, Sakura! 
Oh, I sure like that topic. Life's all about living it to the fullest after all. Hahaha! 
Hey, everyone! Let's do our usual thing! 
...I agree. 
Yeah, yeah! It won't feel like a mission accomplished unless we do that! 
I must agree. This time, why don't you take the lead, Ensign? 
Huh, me? 
Please, wait for a second! 
Aren't forgetting us, the Rose Division? 
W-We would like to... join you... as well... 
OK, everyone come on in! We need to have fun in our lives! All right, Ogami, say it! 
Right. OK now, one... two... 
Victory pose, yeah!! 
Victory pose, yeah!! 
...I-I'm too embarrassed to say it. 
Victory pose, yeah!! 
...I-I'm too embarrassed to say it. 
Oh brother, you're certainly an odd fellow at times. 
Guess I'll do it. Let's go! One, two... 
Victory pose, yeah!! 
Hey, hey, Ogami. Don't just stay silent, are you doing it or not? 
I-I'm sorry. I'm still not used to this I guess. 
I know! How about you do it, Kaede? 
Huh? Me?! 
Yaaay!! Auntie Kaede, do it, do it! 
OK, shall we... do it now? 
OK, here we go. One, two... 
Victory pose, yeah!! 
Meanwhile, the coup army was suppressed and began to surrender one after another. 
The enlisted men who had joined the uprising rejoined their original units. 
All of the commissioned officers, including Amakasa, surrendered and were arrested. 
The mastermind behind the coup d'état, Keigo Kyogoku... 
was found dead in his home, having committed suicide with his own pistol. 
Thus, the drama of rebellion that unfolded on the stage of a snowy Tokyo... 
came to an unexpected conclusion. 
And once again, peace returned to the streets of Tokyo. 
Several long months of struggle fighting the Black Demon Society had come to an end... 
And the Flower Division welcomed peace back into their lives. 
It was the winter of Taisho 14... 
And the sky over Tokyo had become a crystal-clear blue. 
 
Sorry, Ogami, but each customer is only allowed to purchase one photo at a time.

Oh, really? That's too bad.
