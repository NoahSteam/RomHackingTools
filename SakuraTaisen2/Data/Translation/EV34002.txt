Urgh… Impossible… <br> How can this be?!
Hey, Suiko! You all right?!
How could I lose to such measly humans?
Our individual power may be insignificant…
But we have our friends! By working together, we'll never lose, no matter who we're up against!
Hmph… <br> Don't make me laugh, boy.
Your friends aren't there to be trusted… They're there to be used.
But we have each other! By working together, we'll never lose, no matter who we're up against!
Hm hm hm, trust and affection are nothing more than mere illusions. You'll realize that soon enough.
Your friends aren't there to be trusted… They're there to be used.
H-Hey, Suiko! Wait up!
…Dammit, Assault Troupe! We're pullin' back for today, but just you wait!
…Enemy units have retreated. Shall we pursue, Captain?
H-Hey, Suiko, wait a second!!
At any rate, I never thought we'd see the Society here.
I wonder if Uncle Yoneda and everyone back at the theater are gonna be OK.
Well, we'll be back tomorrow anyway, so don't worry about it.
Still, I wish the Black Demon Society would take a vacation too!
Heehee, definitely. I'd like to sit back and relax during my summer break.
Just make sure you all get your heads back in the game after this break is over, OK?
Yeah, yeah, we got it. More importantly, though, Maria, if you could do the usual.
Hm hm, that's right. <br> OK, here we go. <br> All together…
Victory pose, yeah!!
