Oh, is it that late already? 
I should go to Reni's room. I have to try talking to her. 
Reni, it's me. I just want to talk for a minute. Will you open up? 
… 
Oh, hello! <br> Pleased to meet you! 
By any chance, are you… <br> Mr. Ichiro Ogami? I knew it! It really IS you! 
Huh?! Wh-Who are you? 
Starting today, I'll be running the theater's gift shop. 
I’m Tsubomi Nonomura, age 15. 
Ahh, I can't believe I get to work at THE Imperial Theater! It's like a dream come true! 
Huh?! You're running the gift shop? 
I see, so you must be the replacement Tsubaki was talking about. 
Yep, that's me! <br> A hard worker who always wears a smile, smile! 
Looking forward to working with you! 
Let's do our best. 
Smile, smile back atcha!
I look forward to working with you. As fellow theater employees, let's both do our best.
Yes, sir! 
I'm a bit of a scatterbrain, so I tend to mess up a lot… 
But I always put my best foot forward with a smile, smile! I hope you'll support me! 
Hahaha, you're a funny one. 
Smile, smile right back atcha! 
Huh… You sure talk funny, Mr. Ogami! 
R-Really? I was just trying to copy you… 
… 
Oh no, you've gone quiet! Does that mean you hate me?! 
N-No, that's not it. We just met, after all. 
Then I hope you’ll grow to like me more and more! Smile, smile! 
A-Anyway, I look forward to working with you. As fellow theater employees, let's both do our best.
Yes, sir. Will do! 
By the way, I'm sure you know this, but we're a secret unit that fights against demonic forces.
Don't ever forget what it takes to keep the capital safe. 
Yes, sir! I know! 
I might not look it, but I'm here with the full endorsement of the Maidens' Academy! 
Maidens' Academy? 
Yes, that's right. <br> It's, well… A training school for the troupe, established by Mr. Yoneda. 
I see… The manager’s involved in a lot of stuff we’re unaware of, huh. 
Ahh, that's right! <br> I have to report to the office! 
I'm already super late! <br> I have to hurry or I'm not gonna make it! Please excuse me! 
Hey! <br> You're going the wrong way! <br> The office is over here! <br> This way! 
Ahhh, I messed up! <br> Thank you so much! <br> OK, goodbye! 
…Phew. <br> Another colorful character has joined our ranks…  
Ensign Ogami, if I could have a moment. 
Eep! I-It's you! 
Yes. The secret unit of love and beauty, the Rose Division! I am its captain, Kotone. 
I'm Yokihiko! <br> Remember lil' ol' me, Ichiro? 
U-Um… I'm… Kikunojo. <br> You haven't… forgotten me, have you? 
Did you… need something? 
We've just finished setting up our room in the basement. Please, stop by sometime. 
Apparently there's a typhoon headed towards the capital. It's gonna be pretty stormy tonight. 
Kanna's up in the attic right now, getting ready to reinforce the roof. 
That reminds me, Maria will also be heading out the door around 5:30 to buy emergency supplies. 
Huh. I see. 
But no typhoon's gonna bother us down in the basement! 
It's so cozy down there, you should come and play sometime, Ichiro. 
U-Um… We'll be waiting for you. 
Now then, Ensign Ogami, we must take our leave. 
A storm tonight, huh? <br> Well, I guess that’s to be expected when a typhoon comes around.
But boy, those three are practically a typhoon themselves. 
Oh, Ogami… 
You look to have a lot of free time on your hands, Mr. Ensign, as usual. 
Hey Sakura, Orihime. What are you two up to? 
Actually… We were just talking about Reni.
She's been acting kind of strange, and I was wondering what we could do to help. 
You're overthinking things, Sakura. It's not strange for actors to feel nervous about their performances. 
And if there is a different reason, then that's a problem only Reni herself can figure out. 
Stop worrying and leave her alone, I say. 
What do you think, Ogami? 
I agree with Sakura. 
I agree with Orihime. 
I agree with Sakura. 
Helping our friends when they're nervous or troubled is what the Flower Division is all about. 
You're right. I want to be there for Reni. 
I think Orihime has a point. 
I'm worried about Reni, but it's true, there are some problems people can only work out on their own. 
Mr. Ensign seems to understand what I mean.
You can only worry so much about Reni, Sakura. Let's just leave her be. 
…All right then. 
I suppose Reni might feel better by tomorrow… 
Hmmm, it's hard to say who's right. 
For now, I think I'll go talk to her. 
We can’t even begin to help if we don’t know what’s troubling her.
You're right. <br> Thank you, Ogami. 
That is what I was thinking you would say. You really are nosy, Mr. Ensign. 
Well, I have to go now. Good luck with Reni! 
For now, I'll go back to my room as well. Please help Reni, Ogami. 
Everyone’s concerned about Reni…
All right, I should go too. First things first, I need to talk to Reni. 
Rehearsals are done for today. Nobody's here. 
Reni's not here either. I'll go somewhere else. 
Oh… Mon Frère. 
Hey Iris. Why the long face? 
I'm worried about Reni… 
She's looked so unhappy ever since the meeting earlier today. What happened to her? 
Iris… 
Cheer her up. 
Pat her on the head.
Cheer up, Iris. Reni would be the one worrying if she saw you down in the dumps like this.
I'll try talking to her, OK? 
…You will? 
Yeah, I will. You have nothing to worry about. 
…O-OK! 
Thank you, Mon Frère! I feel a little better now. 
Iris… 
Ah! Mon Frère… 
You don't have to worry about Reni. I'll go talk to her. 
Come on, cheer up. First you gotta lift your own spirits, OK? 
…O-OK! 
Thanks, Mon Frère. You're so nice… 
Hmm… I don't know, so I can't say for sure. 
For now, though, I'll try talking to her. 
…OK. Thank you, Mon Frère. 
Wait, I know! I just got a great idea! 
Thanks, Mon Frère! I'm gonna go to the courtyard. 
The courtyard? What for? 
Ehehehe, that's a secret! See you later, Mon Frère! Bye-bye! 
Hahaha, she's finally back to her normal self. 
But what's she planning to do in the courtyard, anyway? 
Oh? Iris is here. 
Heeeey, Iris! 
Ah, Mon Frère! 
Arf, arf! 
Hahaha, 
is with<br>you, too, I see. 
By the way, Iris, what were you doing just now? 
Eheheh! Can you guess? 
Is it related to the play?
Something to do with Reni? 
Playing in the mud?
Would it have something to do with the play, perhaps? 
Nope! It has nothing to do with the play. 
Huh… Then what were you doing? 
Would it have something to do with Reni, perhaps? 
Bingo! You're so smart, Mon Frère! 
So it's something you have to do in the yard that involves Reni… Hmm, I wonder.
Let’s see… You were just playing in the mud, right?
No! I'm not a little kid, you know! 
R-Right. Then what are you doing? 
Hmmm, I have no idea. 
I give up, Iris. Tell me what you’re doing. 
That’s. Our. Little. Secret! Isn't that right, 
? 
Woof. 
OK, Mon Frère, I have to get back to it, so I'll see you later. 
Let's go, 
! 
Arf! 
Ah, Iris! 
Sheesh. Doesn't seem like she'll tell me, no matter how many times I try to ask. 
Oh well, I should go. I'm worried about Reni. 
Iris is still at it, huh? 
Heeey, Iris! The wind's gotten stronger! Be careful! 
Okey-dokey!
Man, whatever it is she's doing, she's sure caught up in it. 
Anyway, I should go somewhere else. 
Arf, arf! 
Hey, 
. How've you been? 
There's a typhoon coming tonight, so you'll have to stay inside once it gets dark out. 
Arf! 
Good answer. See you, 
. 
Arf, arf! 
Oh, Captain. 
Kaede told me you were going out shopping, is that right? 
Yes, I'm going to get some emergency supplies to prepare for the typhoon. 
Going somewhere, Maria? 
Yes, I was on my way to go buy some candles and supplies ahead of the typhoon. 
Shall we go together? 
Be careful out there. 
Be careful out there. The typhoon seems like it's getting closer. 
Thank you, but you don't have to worry, the store's right around the corner. 
Well then, I'll be going. 
Eh, this is Maria we're talking about, she'll be fine. 
Now that she's gone, I should head to another room. 
I don't have much time, so I'll be going. Excuse me. 
Ah, Maria! She's gone… 
I could've at least said, "Come back safely"… 
Well, no use regretting that now. I'll go somewhere else. 
If you don't mind, we could go together. 
Really? I'm just going out shopping. 
It might be nice to take a stroll through the capital before the storm hits. 
Hm hm, you're right. <br> Shall we, then? 
Matches… Candles… <br> That should be everything we need. 
Good. Now let's make our way back to the thea-- 
…It seems like it's started to rain. 
You're right. It's coming down strong, too. 
For now, let's take shelter under the eaves of this building. 
…This isn’t good. The wind is also starting to pick up. 
I didn't bring an umbrella or anything… What should we do? 
We can't exactly stay here forever, either… 
Captain, it might be difficult but let's try and make our way back to the theater. 
B-But… It's so rainy and windy. 
I do have an umbrella, albeit only one. 
Well, it’s not like we can just stay here twiddling our thumbs.
It's nice we get to share an umbrella, but too bad it's in such awful weather. Let's do this, Maria. 
Y-Yes, sir! 
ACHOO! <br> We managed to make it back somehow. 
Are you all right, Maria? 
Yes. <br> Thanks to you, Captain, I managed to stay pretty dry. 
Although, it seems like you got pretty soaked shielding me from the rain. 
Hahaha, it's nothing. Don't worry about it, Maria. 
Sir… Thank you so much. 
Hahaha, I can't exactly leave a lady out in the rain, can I? 
Captain… 
I'm a little wet, but I'm fine. 
The matches and candles stayed dry, too. 
Really? Then this was all worth it. 
I'm soaked… 
Half the matches and candles are ruined, too. 
I'm sorry, Maria. I tried my hardest, but the wind was just too strong. 
It's all right, sir. Don't worry about it. 
I know you tried your best to shield me from the rain. 
Thank you for saying that, Maria. I feel a little better now. 
I appreciate the effort, Captain. Take it easy. 
You too. Try not to catch a cold, OK? 
Thank you. <br> Now then, I have to go. 
My clothes are mostly dry now, so I guess I'll get going. 
Maria should have returned by now, right? 
Oh, Captain! I'm back! 
Welcome back, Maria. How was it out there? 
It started raining all of a sudden halfway through my trip. 
Thankfully I brought an umbrella, but the wind was so strong, I still got a bit soaked. 
I see. That must've been rough. Try not to catch a cold, OK? 
Thank you. Now then, I have to go. 
Hmm… Maybe I should've gone with her after all. 
Well, at least she made it home safe. That's good enough, I guess. 
Looks like Maria's still out. I'll check back later. 
Sounds like the wind's gotten a bit stronger. 
The typhoon's supposed to hit sometime before midnight, right? We'll have to be careful. 
Yo, Boss! 
Oh, Kanna. 
I've been waitin' for ya. How do ya feel ‘bout settlin’ our eatin’ contest once and for all? 
You're on. I'm gonna beat you this time, Kanna! 
Heheh, that's what I like to hear! Let's do this thing! 
The rules are the same as usual. Whoever eats three whole meals' worth of food first wins. 
Today's dish is rafute. Stewed pork cubes, kinda like kakuni, only these are from Okinawa. 
Right, let's get this thing started already. Begin! 
OK, what should I grab first? 
Rafute 
Rice 
Tea 
Rafute, huh? It really is like kakuni… Mm, delicious! 
Heheh, it's been stewin’ for three days, just for our battle today! 
*munch* *munch* <br> All right, blew through that one. 
*munch* *munch* <br> Mm, the rice is great too! That's one bowl down. 
*glug* *glug* <br> OK, now that I've had a breather, onto the next one! 
Which one should I grab first? I'm not sure… 
What's the matter, Boss? It's our final battle! Get into it! 
All right, I finished the first dish. How are you feeling, Kanna? 
Heheh, we're not done yet! 
OK, onto meal two! 
Rafute… 
Rice… 
Tea… 
Rafute plate number two… This is getting pretty tough. 
*munch* *munch*… <br> There, done! 
This rice is starting to fill me up… 
…All right, that's bowl number two finished! 
Gulp… Gulp… 
OK, drinking some tea helped clear out my stomach a bit. I can keep going! 
Hmm… This is getting difficult. 
What's wrong, Boss? I don't see ya movin’ those chopsticks. 
There, that's two meals I've managed to finish! 
Not bad, Boss! Now things are really heatin’ up! 
All right, meal three, last one… Here I go! 
Ra… Rafute! 
Rice! 
Tea! 
I've made it this far, I just have to power through the rest! 
*munch*… 
*munch*… 
*chew*… 
D-Done! That's all the rafute dealt with! 
Just five mouthfuls of rice left… 
Four… Three… 
Two… mouthfuls… <br> Last… mouth… ful… 
DONE!! That's all the rice! 
Urgh… You got this, Ogami! This is the last one!! 
*glug*… *glug*… *glug*! 
PWAHHH!! <br> D-Drank all the tea! 
Close… So close… 
Come on, Ogami… Just one last meal! 
Oh, yeah! I finished the third batch!! 
Huhhh?! Y-You already finished it all?! 
Heheh, it's our final battle. I had to get serious. 
Phew, I'm feelin’ pretty full, too. 
You did a hell of a job, keepin’ up with me like that. 
Guess these past three months have paid off. 
Not feelin’ good today, Boss? This ain't like you. 
What the hell, Boss?! You barely ate anything! Where's your drive?! 
I'm sorry… 
In the end, I still couldn't beat you, Kanna. 
Heh, you did a pretty good job these past three months, though. 
All right, I gotta go. See ya, Boss! 
She's right, I did pretty well to get this far. 
Right, I should get going. I could use a little post-meal exercise. 
ALL RIGHT!! That's three meals done! How do you like that, Kanna?! 
I just finished my third meal, too! 
Huh? Th-Then that means… 
Hahaha! Looks like it's a tie! 
Man, I'm stuffed… I can't move another inch… 
Yeah, me too… I didn't think you'd push me this far. 
… 
Boss… 
Hm? What's up, Kanna? 
Thanks for hangin’ out with me these past couple of months…
My birthday's coming up, you know. 
This was a nice memory to make before I grow a year older… 
Kanna… 
All right, Boss, I'm gonna go. 
In the end, I wasn't able to beat you. 
But ya managed to make it this far in only three months. That’s a heck of a thing. 
Later, Boss! Let's eat together again sometime! 
Kanna… 
I'd like to try her Okinawan cooking again sometime… 
Kanna's… not here. Are we not having our eating contest today? 
Maybe I should try coming back some other time.
This dining hall's going to get really busy once our autumn production begins. 
Doesn't look like anyone's here. I should go. 
Oh, Ogami. Do you need something? 
You came here to listen to my gossip, right, Ogami?
My, you came here like clockwork, Ogami. 
If you're interested in hearing more gossip, I'm all out. Sorry. 
I see… That's too bad. 
I'll have some more interesting tidbits to share another time, so look forward to it! 
Hello, Yuri and Kasumi. 
Oh, hello, Ogami. Is there something you need? 
I've got plenty of new, juicy gossip for you. Ask away! 
Oh, Mr. Ogami! Welcome! 
Hey, Tsubomi. Have you stopped by the office yet? 
Yes, I found my way there, thanks to you! 
While you're here, Mr. Ogami, why not buy a bromide? 
Buy a bromide. 
Talk to Tsubomi. 
Leave. 
Could I take a look at the portraits for sale?
Um, Mr. Ogami? I'm afraid I can only sell you one bromide per month.
We have to leave some for the customers, I hope you understand. 
Buying a bromide? <br> Thank you very much! 
That’s a bromide of <br> Miss Sakura.
She looked so pretty playing Cordelia in "King Lear" this past summer… 
Miss Sakura's bromide? <br> That'll be 50 sen! <br> Thank you, come again! 
That’s a bromide of <br> Miss Sumire. 
Her banter with Miss Kanna in "King Lear" was fantastic! 
I couldn't stop laughing from all the way back in the stands! 
Miss Sumire's bromide? <br> That'll be 50 sen! <br> Thank you, come again! 
That’s a bromide of <br> Miss Maria. 
Miss Maria's going to be in this month's play, right? I can't wait! 
Miss Maria's bromide? <br> That'll be 50 sen! <br> Thank you, come again! 
That’s a bromide of <br> Miss Kanna. 
She was so cool as King Lear! 
Miss Kanna's got a lot of female fans, you know. 
Miss Kanna's bromide? <br> That'll be 50 sen! <br> Thank you, come again! 
That’s a bromide of <br> Miss Iris. 
We'll finally get to see her as Mytyl this month! 
She's gonna be so cute! I can hardly wait! 
Miss Iris's bromide? <br> That'll be 50 sen! <br> Thank you, come again! 
That’s a bromide of <br> Miss Kohran. 
She's the best when it comes to comedies! 
Remember that play she was in a while back, "Dinosaur Island"? I went and saw it five times! 
Miss Kohran's bromide? <br> That'll be 50 sen! <br> Thank you, come again! 
That’s a bromide of <br> Miss Orihime. 
Miss Orihime's Imperial Theater debut as Regan in "King Lear" was great! 
A perfect performance, just like you'd expect from someone who came from the birthplace of theatre! 
Miss Orihime's bromide? <br> That'll be 50 sen! <br> Thank you, come again! 
That’s a bromide of <br> Miss Reni. 
With "The Blue Bird" this month, Miss Reni finally gets to be the star! 
I'm SO looking forward to opening day, I just can't wait! 
Miss Reni's bromide? <br> That'll be 50 sen! <br> Thank you, come again! 
Oh, not buying a bromide after all?
How do you like running the shop, Tsubomi? 
Eheheh, I messed up immediately. 
The very first customer I got, I forgot to take their money and had to chase after them. 
You forgot to take their money? Unbelievable… 
Eheheh, amazing, right? 
(I don't think that's something to be proud of.) 
I saw Miss Maria heading towards the entrance just now. 
It looked like she was gonna go shopping or something. 
I've bought so many things here as a customer, and now I get to WORK here! 
Ahhh, this really is a dream come true! I'm gonna give it my all! 
Good luck punching tickets at the next show, Mr. Ogami! 
Well, I should be going. Keep up the good work. 
Thank you for your patronage! Come again! 
Thank you for your patronage! Make sure to buy a bromide next time! 
Oh, Kohran. You're a rare sight in this room. 
What are you talking about, Chief? I come to the music room too, sometimes. 
Though I didn't exactly come here to practice music today. 
Huh? Then what are you here for? 
I was just examining this piano, trying to figure out how it makes sound. 
But I can't make heads or tails of it by just looking at the outside, so I'm kinda stuck. 
Even you don't know, huh. 
Why not ask Orihime? 
How about dismantling it? 
I see… I guess there are some things even you don't know, huh. 
O-Of course there are! There's tons of stuff I don't know yet! 
Besides, the world would be way more boring if I knew everything. 
Huh, why’s that? 
Because, whenever I think about all the stuff I still have to learn, I get so excited.
I want to keep discovering new things so I can keep feeling that sense of excitement.
I see… That's so like you, Kohran. 
Why not ask Orihime, then? She plays the piano a lot. 
Oh yeah! Why didn't I think of that? 
Thanks a bunch, Chief. I'll ask Orihime later. 
What if you tried dismantling it, then? 
D-Dismantling it? That's going overboard, Chief. 
…Well, there ARE tons of things I'd like to take apart. 
But that piano looks real pricey, so I’d feel bad if I wrecked it.
Hmm… I have no idea how pianos work, either. 
I see… Eh, whatever. I'm in no hurry. 
All right, I'm gonna go. I'll come back to give this piano a good once over some other time. 
OK, later, Kohran. 
See ya! 
Trying to figure out how a piano works, huh? Kohran sure is curious. 
OK, I should go. I wonder what the others are up to. 
Nobody's here. Well, rehearsals are over, after all. 
Oh well, I'll just go somewhere else. 
I wonder if Mr. Yoneda is in his office. 
…Yeah, I should go somewhere else. 
Are you in there, sir? It's Ogami. 
Snooooore, snooooore… 
Sounds like he's asleep. Good grief. 
Oh well, guess I'll head to another room. 
Oh, Ogami! Come on in. 
Right. Pardon me. 
Yo, Ogami. Feel like sharing a drink? 
N-No, I'll pass. 
Right. So, what can I do you for? 
Ask about Tsubomi. 
Ask about the Rose Div. 
Um, about Tsubomi, the girl working the gift shop… 
Ah, Tsubomi Nonomura? What about her? 
She said she came from a "Maidens' Academy." 
What exactly is that? 
Ah, right. You don’t know about the academy, do you, Ogami?
The Maidens' Academy is a training school for Imperial Assault Troupe recruits. 
A training school? For the troupe? 
Yep. With all these demon attacks, the Flower Division will hit their limit sooner or later.
We train young ladies to be the next Flower Division, both on stage and on the battlefield. 
To this day, though, we have yet to find pilots more suitable for the program than young girls… 
I understand the reality of the situation, but I still can't help but feel guilty about it…
…I see. 
About the Rose Division… Just who are they, anyway? 
Ah, those guys? Despite all appearances, they're soldiers of the Imperial Army. 
Huh?! I don't believe it… 
It's the truth. However, their unique personalities got them expelled from the military… 
They apparently wanted to come here anyway, so I let 'em. 
But they're calling themselves a division of the Imperial Assault Troupe… 
They just made that up. Formally, there is no such thing as the Rose Division. 
But really, who cares? Let 'em call themselves whatever they want. 
O-OK… If you say so, sir… 
Right then, if you don't have any more questions, you should probably get going, Ogami. 
You've got stuff you need to take care of, right? 
Y-Yes, sir… Reni's been acting strange lately, so I thought I'd go talk to her. 
Good. Now I can drink my sake with peace of mind, knowing you're on top of it. 
R-Right… I'll be going, now. 
There's so much that goes on without me knowing, huh… 
Well, no use thinking about that right now. I should go. 
Oh, Ogami. 
Saki? What are you doing here? 
Oh, nothing. Just taking a walk. 
Actually, this is where we first met, isn't it? 
Now that you mention it, you're right. 
Heehee… Time really flies, doesn't it? 
Well then, I'd better get going. Farewell, Ogami. 
Saki… What's with her today? 
No use mulling it over. I should go. 
We're between performances, so nobody's here. 
I should go. I don't have a lot of time to waste. 
It's just about dinnertime. What's on the menu tonight? 
…No, now's not the time to be thinking about that. I should go. 
Nobody's here. The others all seem to be elsewhere. 
The costumes here will see a lot of action in the fall production. 
But I'm more worried about the person who’s gonna be wearing the costume. Reni…
Hmmm… Nobody's here, eh? 
Oh well. Guess I'll go somewhere else. 
“The Blue Bird" takes place in a whimsical, dreamlike world. 
These sets and props help breathe life into that world. 
Thought I'd take the time to come here, but unfortunately, nobody's around. 
I was watching the rehearsal from here just a moment ago…
Rehearsals are over for today, so no one's here. Oh well, I'll just go. 
Nobody's here. I'll check another room. 
Everyone was here for rehearsal not that long ago… 
Why did Reni freeze up like that? 
Our autumn production will finally open this month. 
I'll have to get in some ticket-punching practice before then. 
“King Lear” was such a hit last summer, it was standing room only. 
I hope our fall production draws a big crowd, too. 
Doesn't look like any of the others are here. 
Oh well. Guess I'll go somewhere else. 
I better prepare for the fall production by getting some ticket-punching practice in.
"The Blue Bird," huh? I hope we'll get a lot of people to come see it. 
Nobody here in the lobby. 
Oh well, better go somewhere else. 
Huh? The door's open. 
Is Sakura in there? 
The door's still open. 
Is Sakura in there? 
Take a quick peek inside. 
Leave. 
Well, I AM curious… I’ll just peek inside real quick. 
No, I shouldn't just barge into someone’s rooms uninvited. 
I'll go somewhere else… This is really gonna bug me, though. 
Pass this through here, then do this over here… 
Heehee, I think I'm about halfway done now. 
I hope Ogami will like it… 
Hmm? Did she say my name?
Now I'm curious. I’ll just peek inside real quick.
Do this over here, and then… 
Hey, Sakura, what are you up to? 
Huh?! O-Ogami!! 
Oh, s-sorry, I just saw your door was open, thought I'd take a look. 
Oh… I see. 
… 
… 
Sakura, are you holding something behind your back? 
Huh? N-No, not really… 
Well now I'm really curious. Let me see. 
O-Ogami! Absolutely not!! 
Whoa, whoa, whoa! You don't have to chase me out. 
Sorry about this, Ogami. 
What in the world are you doing in there, Sakura? 
Heehee, it's a secret. Now please excuse me. 
Hmm, what could it be? This is gonna bug me… 
Doesn't seem like she'll tell me, no matter how much I ask. I guess I'll drop it for now. 
Hey, Sakura, about earlier… 
I can't tell you yet, Ogami. 
Sorry, but I'm quite busy right now. 
Sakura… 
Oh well. Guess I'll go. 
I'm curious about whatever Sakura's up to… 
But I don't think she's going to tell me anything. I should just drop it and leave. 
Is Sakura in her room? 
She did just say earlier she was going to read over the script… 
I don't want to bother her, so I won't say anything. 
…Yes? 
It's Ogami. May I come in, Sakura? 
…Sure. Door's open. 
Pardon the intrusion, then. 
What's wrong, Sakura? Why the long face? 
… 
Uh, well… There's a typhoon coming tonight, right? 
I was wondering if maybe there'd be thunder, too… 
Oh, right. You're afraid of thunder, aren't you? 
I've gotten over it, for the most part, but… I'm still a little scared. 
Ahahahaha! 
It's OK, I'm here for you.
Ahahahaha! 
It's OK, I'm here for you.
Shall I check on you later?
Ahahahaha! Right, it's gonna be pretty stormy tonight. 
Still, I didn’t think you were still afraid of thunder.
So what if I am still afraid?!
I can't easily just get over something that's terrified me since childhood! 
Oh… S-Sorry, that was kinda mean.
O-Ogami… You don't have to tease me like that. 
Oh… Sorry about that. 
Whatever! You must think I'm being silly, don't you?!
I have to read my lines now, so please leave me alone. 
R-Right. I'll be going, then. 
*sigh*… <br> Boy, I sure made her upset. 
…Well, better shake it off and go somewhere else.
It's all right, Sakura. I'm here for you. 
Worst comes to worst, I could hide your belly button again so the Thunder God can't find it.
Jeez, Ogami… 
Heehee, thinking about that memory makes me feel a bit calmer. 
Thanks, Ogami. 
Ogami… Thank you. 
I feel a little better now. 
Worrying about the thunder was getting in the way of my line reading. 
Now I can finally compose myself and get it done. 
Glad I could help. All right, I should get going now. 
OK. Thanks again.
Thunder, huh? She's right, it's going to get pretty stormy tonight. 
Right, guess I'll go check a different room now. 
Maybe I could come by later tonight and check on you, if that’s all right. 
Really? I don't want to impose… 
It's no problem, I'll be doing my rounds on the night watch anyway. 
Thank you. In that case, I'd appreciate it. 
Worrying about the thunder was getting in the way of my line reading. 
Now I think I can finally concentrate on it. 
Glad I could help. All right, I should get going now. 
OK. Thank you. 
I'll have to remember to come by tonight. 
Right then, I should go somewhere else. 
…You must think I'm being silly, don't you, Ogami? 
N-No, of course not. 
It's all right, Sakura, I'm sure there won't be any thunder tonight. 
… 
I'm still a little nervous, but I'll try to take my mind off it by going over my lines. 
I see. Well then, I should get going. 
OK. Thank you. 
Hmmm… I wonder if we'll get any thunder tonight.
No use wasting time thinking about it. I should go to another room. 
It's just like Sakura to have a cute nameplate like this. 
Let's go check another room. 
Yo, is that you, Boss? 
Fixing up the roof, right? Kaede told me. 
Yep. There's a typhoon headed our way, so I figured now's the time to patch up the roof. 
I don't see you here too often, Kanna. What are you up to? 
There's a typhoon headed our way, so I figured now's the time to patch up the roof. 
Basically, I'm gonna climb up on the roof and do a little carpentry. 
You're so reliable. 
You're surprisingly handy.
You, climbing on the roof?
You're so reliable. 
You're surprisingly handy.
Sure you won't break it? 
You're so reliable. We can all rest easy knowing you’re on the job.
Thanks, Boss. You can leave it all to me! 
You, doing carpentry? You're surprisingly handy. 
D-Don't be silly, I'm not handy. All I'm gonna be doin’ is poundin’ nails with a hammer, hahaha. 
You, climbing up on the roof? 
Yeah, and? Somethin' weird ‘bout that? 
You don't think I'm gonna stomp around and break the roof, do ya? 
N-Nobody said anything about that! 
I'm kiddin’, relax. Well, wouldn't be too surprisin’ if that happened, though. Ahahahaha! 
You, climbing up on the roof? Sure you won't break it instead? 
Tsch. That's mean, Boss. You didn't have to say that. 
Oh… S-Sorry, I guess I took that joke a little too far. 
What's up, Boss? Is it really that weird for me to be doin’ carpentry? 
N-No, that's not it at all… 
I grew up in Okinawa, so I'm used to typhoons. 
Fixin’ a roof like this is a piece of cake for me. 
I see… 
Hey, I know! Wanna help me out, Boss? 
This job would get done a lot faster if ya helped me out. 
Sure, I'll help! 
I'm busy right now. 
I'm not good with heights… 
Sure, I'll help! We've got this, Kanna! 
That's my boss! Good answer! 
OK, let's not waste anymore time… 
…Is what I'd like to say. This theater's huge, so it's gonna be a hassle gettin’ up to the roof. 
We'll have to climb through the attic to get to the exit leadin’ up there. 
I see. We'll be in big trouble if we fall. 
Exactly. Watch your step. Right, let's do this!! 
I'd love to help out, but… I'm busy right now. 
Tsch. That's cold, Boss. 
Oh well, if you're busy, you're busy. I'll take care of this myself. 
Sorry, Kanna. Try not to get hurt, OK? 
Of course, thanks! Later, Boss. 
Fixing the roof means we have to… climb on top of it, right? 
I'm… not good with heights. 
Ahahahaha! What are you talkin’ about? You ride on the Soaring Whale all the time! 
Let's make our way up to the roof through the attic. 
You can get a helluva view of the capital from up there. C'mon, let's go! 
K-Kanna! Hold on a second!! 
Hmmm… I don't know. 
C'mon, Boss. You can get a helluva view of the capital from up on the theater's roof. 
True… All right, sure. I'll help. 
That's what I'm talkin' about! All right, let's make our way up to the roof through the attic. 
Remember to watch your step. Let's go, Boss! 
Yahoo! We're here, Boss! 
The view's awesome, the breeze is refreshin’… This is great! 
I thought gettin’ up here would be way harder, but that took no time at all! 
Those Navy skills were somethin' else, Boss. You cleared those obstacles like they were nothin'.
We made it! Nice job, Boss. 
Man, gettin’ up here was a real pain… Nice job, Boss. 
Wh-Whatever, Kanna… Let's just hurry up and get this roof fixed! 
Oh yeah, you're bad with heights, huh? My bad. 
All right, let's get this done, then. 
You were right, Kanna. It feels great up here. I'm glad I came. 
Heheh, right? Happy to hear ya like it. 
All right then, let's get this roof fixed! 
Thanks, Boss. You were a huge help up there. 
With the roof properly patched up, we can face any ol' typhoon. 
I'm glad I could be of help. 
Right then, I'm gonna go. Later, Boss. 
Phew… That was a lot of work. 
By the way, don't forget about our eatin’ contest. It's time to settle things once and for all! 
I'll be waitin’ for ya in the dining hall starting from half past 5. See ya! 
Hmm, guess that means it's time for our final battle. That was a good way to work up an appetite, then! 
Well, I should get going too. Where to next? 
No one's here… 
I wonder where everyone's at? I'll go somewhere else. 
Oh, is that you, Maria? Mind teaching me some more about billiards? 
Yes, that's what I was waiting here for. 
Right, let's not waste any time, then. 
By the way, sir, about Reni… 
She's been acting peculiar for a while now, outside of today's rehearsal and even during battles.
So you noticed too, huh? I figured you would. 
That girl… She sort of reminds me of a former version of myself. 
Back when all I ever did was fight… When I was unable to trust anyone. 
Maria… 
…Well, now it's your turn, Captain. It's make or break. What will you do? 
Go for it. 
Don't risk it. 
OK, this one decides it all. It might be risky, but I have to go for it! 
Ah, I didn't make it. 
Hm hm hm, now it's my turn. 
Aw man, guess I lose. If only I made that last shot… 
You couldn't make that shot now, but I know you'll be able to someday, Captain. 
Just like with Reni. I know you'll make it through to her someday. 
Maria… 
I won't risk it. My chance will come if I just wait. 
Indeed. Sometimes waiting is the best option. 
It's just like us with Reni. We need to wait until she's ready to open up to us. 
I believe that day will come. I'm sure of it. 
Maria… 
Hmmm… I don't know. 
Captain, there are times when you need to cast your doubts aside and move forward. 
It's just like with Reni, you won't be able to get through to her without a strong resolve. 
Maria… 
Lost by a hair… 
But you've definitely gotten better, compared to last month. 
At this rate, you'll be able to beat me someday. 
Thank you, Maria. Care to join me again next time? 
Yes, with pleasure. 
Now then, I have to take care of something, so I'll be going. 
Will the day truly come when I can beat Maria? 
Hearing her say that does fill me with confidence, though. 
Maria's not here. I was hoping we could play some more billiards… 
But I guess I came too late. 
No one's here… 
Oh well. I'll go somewhere else. 
Is that you, Maria? Were you looking for a book? 
Yes, sir. I was looking for "The Blue Bird" by Maeterlinck. 
I was thinking of reading it again to use as a reference for our play.
Tyltyl and Mytyl, together on a marvelous journey to find the blue bird… 
Captain, do you know what the blue bird they're searching for represents? 
Eternal life. 
Happiness. 
Money. 
I'm pretty sure it's… eternal life. 
…Wrong. The blue bird in this work represents happiness. 
O-Oh… Is that so… 
Don't pretend to know what you don't, sir. 
I'm pretty sure it's… happiness. 
Precisely. Impressive, sir. You're quite knowledgeable. 
I'm pretty sure it's… money. 
…Wrong. The blue bird in this work represents happiness. 
O-Oh… Is that so… 
Don't pretend to know what you don't, sir. 
Hmmm, I have no idea. 
Hm hm hm, that could also be the right answer, in a sense. 
In the play, the blue bird is written to represent happiness. 
But what happiness means, well… That’s different from person to person. 
The blue bird that Reni and Iris are after… 
What do you suppose it means to them? 
Maria… 
Forgive me, I'm just rambling. 
Now then, there's something I need to take care of. Excuse me, sir. 
I'll be around to play billiards until 5:30. 
The blue bird, huh…? 
Well, I'd better get going. 
It's fall already. The perfect season for reading. 
I can wait till nighttime to read, though. I should go somewhere else. 
Ensign… 
Oh, Sumire. 
I've been waiting for you, Ensign. Once again, I shall teach you how to properly serve tea this month. 
OK, let's start our lesson, then. 
So, I've just finished steeping these tea leaves. 
Would you be so kind as to pour me a cup, Ensign? 
Pour it quickly. 
Pour it slowly. 
Pour it to the last drop. 
(All right, let's try pouring this out quickly!) 
Ow, hot hot hot! Crap, it spilled! 
For goodness' sake, Ensign! That's far too fast. 
Black tea must be poured out gradually to the last drop. 
That final drop is what we call the "Golden Drop." 
That is because it is even more highly concentrated with delicious tea. 
I-I see… How educational. 
(OK, I'll pour it out carefully to the very last drop) 
… 
Ensign, that is much too slow. 
If you pour it out that slowly, the tea will be far too bitter by the end. 
R-Really? 
When it comes to serving tea, you must be neither quick nor slow… 
Pour it gradually to the very last drop. 
That final drop is what we call the "Golden Drop." 
That is because it has the highest concentration of delicious tea extract. 
I-I see… How educational. 
(OK, I'll pour it out gradually to the very last drop.) 
… 
OK, I'm done pouring. How was that, Sumire? 
Splendid, Ensign. Your pouring technique was impressive. 
That last drop is what we call the "Golden Drop." 
That is because it has the highest concentration of delicious tea extract. 
You've learned quite well, Ensign. 
Hahaha, thanks. 
Do hurry up, Ensign! 
If you take too long, the tea will become bitter! 
R-Really? 
When it comes to serving tea, you must be neither quick nor slow… 
Pour it gradually to the very last drop. 
That final drop is what we call the "Golden Drop." 
That is because it has the highest concentration of delicious tea extract. 
I-I see… How educational. 
That's enough, Ensign. Let's stop here for this lesson. 
Thank you, Sumire. I learned a lot today.
I'll be waiting for you here again next month. 
Guess there's a proper method for every step of making tea, isn't there? 
Well, I've finished my tea and had a nice break. I should get going. 
Oh, Sumire, is that you? 
Oh, Ensign. Would you care to have some milk tea with me? 
Really? Well, since you asked so nicely, then sure, why not? 
Now then, I'll prepare you a delectable cup of milk tea. 
… 
Huh? You're putting in the milk first? 
Yes, that's right. Do you know why? 
To weaken the tea's flavor? 
So the milk doesn't curdle? 
Force of habit? 
Hmm, if I had to guess, I'd say it's to weaken the tea's strong flavor? 
I see. I suppose that's one way to think of it. 
“One way"? What's the right answer, then? 
Ohohohoho! <br> My apologies, Ensign, it's merely a habit of mine. 
If I had to give a reason, I suppose it's because it makes the milk easier to measure out. 
S-Seriously? Sheesh, you had me for a second, there. 
Hmm, if I had to guess, I'd say it's to prevent the milk from curdling? 
Goodness, the milk doesn't curdle, even if you pour it in after the tea. 
In that case, what's the right answer? 
Ohohohoho! <br> My apologies, Ensign, it's merely a habit of mine. 
If I had to give a reason, I suppose it's because it makes the milk easier to measure out. 
S-Seriously? Sheesh, you had me for a second, there. 
If I had to guess, I'd say it's just a force of habit? 
My, Ensign! You're quite sharp! 
Indeed, it's merely a habit of mine. 
If I had to give a reason, I suppose it's because it makes the milk easier to measure out. 
I see… 
Actually, I'm a little embarrassed you were actually able to guess that. 
Hmmm, I have no idea. 
Well, it's only natural you wouldn't know. 
That's because it's merely a habit of mine.
If I had to give a reason, I suppose it's because it makes the milk easier to measure out. 
S-Seriously? Sheesh, you had me for a second, there. 
Here, Ensign. Your milk tea. 
Thank you. Cheers. 
… 
Phew, that was delicious. Thank you. 
It would do you some good to enjoy a cup of tea every once in a while, Ensign. 
Hahaha, well, you know how busy I usually am. 
Right, I'll be going, then. Thanks again for the milk tea. 
Take care, Ensign. 
Looks like Sumire's still enjoying her tea. 
I shouldn't bother her, so I guess I'll just get going. 
Sumire might have another tea lesson for me. I'll come back later. 
Hmm… Guess no one's around. 
I thought I might find someone here, but I guess not. Too bad. 
Ah, Mr. Ensign. 
You told me to ask Orihime, so I went to her right away. 
Now I know a bunch more about pianos. Thanks a ton. 
There's not a thing I don't know about pianos. 
You're quite perceptive, Mr. Ensign. 
Hahaha, thanks. 
By the way, Chief. It's been getting pretty windy, huh? 
Yo, Chief. Getting kinda windy, huh? 
You're right. The typhoon seems to be getting closer. 
We don't have typhoons or anything back in Italy, so I'm looking forward to it. 
Oh yeah, Chief, do you know which language the word "typhoon" comes from? 
Is it Japanese?
Is it Chinese?
Is it English?
Huh? Is it not a Japanese word? 
You'd think so, but actually no. 
There's all kindsa theories saying it's originally Chinese or Arabic or what have you, but… 
…But? 
But the truth is, we don't actually know! 
H-Hey, no fair, that was a trick question! 
Ahaha, sorry. At least you learned something, right? 
Hmmm… Chinese, I guess? 
Oh, not a bad guess, Chief. 
There's all kindsa theories saying it's originally Chinese or Arabic or what have you, but… 
…But? 
But the truth is, we don't actually know! 
H-Hey, no fair, that was a trick question! 
Ahaha, sorry. At least you learned something, right? 
Hmmm… It's definitely English, right? 
Not originally. In English, "typhoon" is a loan word. 
There's all kindsa theories saying it's originally Chinese or Arabic or what have you, but… 
…But? 
But the truth is, we don't actually know! 
H-Hey, no fair, that was a trick question! 
Ahaha, sorry. At least you learned something, right? 
Hmm… Don't know. 
That's right! The answer is we don't know! 
There's all kindsa theories saying it's originally Chinese or Arabic or what have you…  
But the truth is, we still don't really know. 
Wow, I'm impressed, Mr. Ensign. 
Though, if I didn't know better, it almost sounded as if you simply didn’t know…
All right, Orihime, let's split. 
Oh, yes. We have to be going, Mr. Ensign. See you later. 
I'll be working on the Koubu later tonight, Chief, so stop by if ya got time. 
All right, gotta go. See ya. 
The wind's gotten stronger. I should get going, too. 
The weather outside is still nice, but the wind's getting stronger and stronger. 
No use sticking around here. I should go. 
I wonder if Kaede's in her room right now.
…Yeah, I should go somewhere else. 
It's Ogami. Are you there, Kaede? 
Oh, Ogami. The door's unlocked, come in. 
Right. Pardon me. 
Welcome, Ogami. Did you need something? 
Have a chat. 
Ask about Ayame. 
Nothing in particular. 
It's gotten quite windy out, hasn't it? 
Yes it has. Looks like everyone's getting ready for the typhoon tonight. 
Kanna said she was going to fix the roof while there's still time, so I think she might be in the attic. 
Maria said she was going to buy some emergency supplies, so you might find her by the entrance.
I see. Sounds like everyone's working hard. 
I would like to hear about Ayame… If that's OK with you. 
Why, of course. Hmm. What should I talk about? 
No… Nothing in particular. 
Oh, really? Hm hm, you really are an odd one, Ogami. 
Well then, I have to excuse myself. 
You're always welcome here. 
All right. Well, I should get going. Please excuse me. 
I'm glad I could talk with you, Kaede. I'll drop by again when I've got time. 
It's Ogami. Are you there, Kaede? 
Ah, Ogami? 
I'm sorry, but I have to write these reports. 
I see. Then I'll see you later. 
Sorry, Ogami. Let's have a nice talk some other time.
Oh, Ogami. 
Saki? What are you doing here? 
… 
The Flower Division, they all work as actresses on that stage. 
Some actresses, however, you'll never find up on a stage. 
What's that supposed to mean? 
Yes, whatever could it mean? 
Well then, I'd better get going. Farewell, Ogami. 
Saki… What was that all about? 
No use mulling it over. I should go. 
The seats are empty if there's no show going on. 
There's no use staying here. I should go somewhere else. 
Phew… Nothing like being in my own room to calm me down. 
Now, what should I do… 
Call someone. 
Maybe next time. 
I know, why don't I make a call? 
Reni, it's me. I just want to talk for a minute. Will you open up? 
… 
I'll try later. I still have other stuff to do. 
This place will be packed full of guests once we begin our fall production. 
Nobody's here now, though. Guess I'll go elsewhere. 
Maria? Are you there? 
Looks like nobody's home. 
It's Maria's nameplate. 
If I remember right, Maria's going out shopping around 5:30… 
I'll stop by the entrance later and see. 
OK, time to check another room. 
I wonder if Kanna is in her room.
…She's not here. 
Kanna's… Well, I guess it's more of a nametag than a nameplate. 
OK, let's check another room. 
I wonder if Sumire is in her room.
Nope, not here. 
This is a pretty subtle design, considering it's Sumire. 
Let's check another room. 
I wonder if Orihime is in her room.
Hmm. Guess nobody's home. 
The nameplate has a simple design, but it sure looks high class. 
Let's go check another room. 
I wonder if Kohran is in her room. 
There's no response. Looks like she's somewhere else. 
A gear-shaped nameplate, huh? It's just Kohran's style. 
Let's check another room. 
I wonder if Iris is in her room. 
No answer. Guess she's not here. 
At any rate, it looks like today's a day off from her studies. 
So Iris's nameplate is shaped like Jean-Paul… 
OK, I'll check another room. 
I wonder if Reni is in her room.
Reni, it's me. I just want to talk for a minute. Will you open up? 
… 
It's just a piece of paper from a notebook. I suppose that's fitting for someone like Reni. 
OK, let's check another room. 
Sumire, is that you? Didn't think I'd find you here. 
I thought I’d stop by the hangar on my way back from the stage.
If we didn't have the Koubu in our battle at Atami last month, we would've been in grave danger.
Yeah, we made it out by the skin of our teeth. 
At any rate, the Black Demon Society somehow knew we'd be in Atami. 
Don't you find that strange, Ensign? 
Yeah, how did they know? 
Probably a coincidence. 
Were they on vacation too?
Could there be a spy? 
Probably a coincidence. 
Were they on vacation too?
You're right, how did the Black Demons get a hold of that kind of information? 
…I see. So you don't have any guesses, then? 
Eh, probably just a coincidence. Nothing to worry about. 
This is not the time to be careless, Ensign. 
If the Imperial Assault Troupe's intel is leaking out to the Black Demons, we are in serious trouble! 
Y-You're right. Sorry. 
For heaven's sake! You need to take this more seriously! 
Well, it WAS summer, maybe they were there on vacation too? 
…Ensign, while I don't dislike that particular brand of humor… 
I was trying to have a serious discussion. There's a time and place for everything. 
S-Sorry. Got a little carried away. 
Could it be… There's a spy in our midst? 
You think so too, Ensign? I was wondering the same, myself. 
I discussed it with Maria beforehand. 
Well, what did she say? 
Maria stayed quiet for a while, at first. 
Then she said not to cast doubts without evidence, that I'd be playing right into the enemy's hand.
I see… 
Maria's right. We can't just take shots in the dark without evidence. 
Don't tell anybody else about this, OK, Sumire? 
Yes, understood. 
Don't stay quiet, Ensign, please say something. 
OK, but… I don't really know, either. 
Oh. How disappointing. 
Regardless, we mustn't be careless. 
Yeah, you're right, but we can't get riled up by their tricks, either. 
It's important that we keep living our lives like normal. 
Yes, I was thinking the same thing. 
Now then, I'd better get going. Take care, Ensign. 
Ah, that's right, come meet me in the salon later. 
We'll continue our lessons on tea etiquette from last time. 
Sumire's gone, I should get going too. 
Nobody's here. I thought I might find Kohran here, but I guess not. 
Well, rehearsals are over, so she's probably going to be working on the Koubu through the night. 
Huh? Looks like someone's in the bathroom. 
I'm pretty sure this is what Maria was wearing earlier… 
Th-Then that means… Maria's in the bath right now… 
I am drawn to the bath…
Go back outside. 
O-Oh, no… My body is moving towards the bathroom on its own… 
(Maria… She was soaking wet after that shopping trip.) 
(She must've felt pretty chilly, what with it being September and all.) 
(…! <br> Uh-oh, I feel a sneeze coming on!) 
Sneeze. 
(C-Crap, I can't hold it in any longer!) 
ACHOO!! 
…!! <br> C-Captain?! 
S-Sorry Maria! It's just, I, uh… 
Captain! Get out… <br> Get out this instant!! 
Y-Yes, ma'am! Right away, ma'am! 
… 
I'm sorry, Maria. I went in without really thinking… 
What's the matter with you, peeping into the bath like that?! You're the captain!! 
This is a communal living space! The least you could do is follow the basics of rules and manners!
Yes, ma'am… Understood. 
I'll be going now. Think about what you've done, Captain. 
Man, she's furious with me… Well, it WAS my fault. 
I should pull myself together and get going. 
(Urgh… Mmf… I-I think I managed to suppress my sneeze.) 
(N-Now's my chance to get out of here, quick!) 
Phew, made it out of there alive. 
If Maria had found me there, I would've been in deep trouble. 
(Maria must've gotten soaked when she went out to buy supplies for everyone.) 
(OK, let's head outside. I can't peep in the bath.) 
All right, that's enough for now. 
Take as long as you need, Maria, so you don't catch a cold. 
Phew… Right, I suppose it's time I got out. 
(Oh crap!! It looks like she's leaving the bathroom!) 
(I gotta get out of here before she sees me!) 
Phew, I think I got away before she realized I was there. 
If I'd been just a moment slower, I might not have made it. That was too close… 
Oh, Captain… Were you looking to take a bath, too? 
N-No… That's not it. 
I see. I just got out, myself. 
There's nothing quite as refreshing as taking a hot bath after a hard day's work. 
Anyway, I have to go. <br> Take care, Captain. 
It's true, nothing beats taking a bath after a long day. 
I should get going. I've still got things I need to do. 
Looks like no one's taking a bath right now. 
I'll go to a different room. I wonder where everyone else is. 
Oh, is that you, Kanna? 
Oh, well if it ain't the boss. 
Even I get full sometimes, so I was just doing some light post-meal exercise. 
I was just doing some light exercise to prepare for our eating contest. 
I come down here to train sometimes. Daily trainin’ is important, you know. 
I see. That's our Kanna. 
Whenever I feel nervous about anything, I just start workin' out. 
When I work out, it feels like the sweat washes away all my worries.
I hope Reni can get over whatever it is that's botherin’ her, too… 
Kanna… 
I know she will. 
Hmm… Might be tough. 
What if you coached her? 
It'll be all right, Kanna. I know Reni will figure things out. 
Besides, she has us to help her whenever she's in trouble. 
…You're right. You always know just what to say, Boss! 
Hmmm… That might be tough. Do you think Reni will really be OK? 
Aw, c'mon, Boss! Don't talk like that. 
Ya gotta be there for her. That's the captain's job, isn't it? 
Y-You're right. I can't be saying things like that. 
Well then, what if you helped train her? 
No, Boss. Despite all appearances, Reni's not your average kid. 
The way she's always on her guard, she seems pretty skilled already. 
Now that you mention it, there was that time she threw me to the ground like it was nothing. 
She did that to YOU?! Huh… You really can't judge a book by its cover, can you? 
I see… Still, I wonder when she picked up those combat skills. 
Yeah… I'm definitely curious. 
Don't just clam up like that, Boss. 
I'm tryin' to be serious, but you're makin' me feel silly. 
Ah… S-Sorry, I didn't mean to. 
Welp, I worked up a decent sweat, so I'm gonna get goin'. 
Later, Boss. Take care of Reni, all right? 
Take care of Reni, huh… 
Kanna's worried about Reni, in her own way. 
I don't have time to work out right now. 
I should go somewhere else. Where is everyone, anyway? 
Wh-What is this…? <br> And that smell… <br> It reeks of roses… 
Oh my, Ogami! Welcome! 
You actually came… I'm so happy… 
Come on, Ichiro, don't be shy! Come in! 
S-Sure… 
B-By the way, what exactly are you doing here, anyway? 
Hmhmhm… Ogami, do you know what the thorns on a rose are there for? 
To harm others? 
To protect itself? 
Just for decoration? 
The thorns on a rose? They're for hurting others, right? 
No, that's not it. A rose's thorns are its weapons, made to protect what's important. 
The thorns on a rose? They're for protecting itself, right? 
Yes, exactly. A rose's thorns are its weapons, made to protect what's important. 
Hmm… Aren't they just there for decoration? 
No, that's not it. A rose's thorns are its weapons, made to protect what's important. 
Hmmm… No idea. 
Then I'll tell you. A rose's thorns are its weapons, made to protect what's important. 
Of course, what WE'RE protecting isn't ourselves. 
Well then… What is it? 
That's. Our. Little. Secret! 
But never mind that, Ichiro! Stay here and play with us for a while! 
N-No, I'm good, thanks! I really ought to get going now! Excuse me! 
Oh, what a shame. Come back whenever you'd like. 
Um… We'll be… waiting for you… 
R-Right… I'll be going, now. 
Phew… It feels like the smell of roses is clinging to my body. 
Still, how did they set up that room so quickly…? 
Oh, Ogami. What's the status up on the surface? 
The typhoon's getting closer, so the wind's picking up. 
It's safe and warm down here underground. Why don't you come down to play for a while? 
Eep! I-I'll pass! 
A-All right, I gotta go! 
Ah! Ichiroooo! 
Sheesh… I'm putting my life on the line every time I step into that room. 
Oh, Ogami. 
Saki? What are you doing here? 
Oh, nothing. Just taking a walk. 
I was just wondering when this room will be used again. 
Perhaps… it might even be tonight. 
Well then, I'd better get going. Farewell, Ogami. 
Saki… What's with her today? 
No use mulling it over. I should go. 
That reminds me, Kaede spoke to me about Reni at the meeting earlier today. 
She's been acting strangely both on stage and in battle… What's wrong with her? 
I detect the faint smell of roses… 
The smell of roses in a messy storeroom… It's enough to make my head spin. 
Ooh, smells like soap in here. Must be because Maria just took a bath. 
There's no point in standing idly by in here. Let's move to another room. 
I thought someone might be taking a bath right now, but I guess not. 
Oh well, I'll just go somewhere else. 
Doesn't look like anybody's swimming in here… 
All right, I'll check a different room. 
The steam processor… An incredible machine, one of only a few in all of Japan. 
We barely ever use it, so I'm sure it doesn't feel very appreciated. 
Hmm… Guess no one's here. 
I probably shouldn't stick around. 
OK, who to call? 
Hello? <br> This is Tsubaki Takamura. 
Hey, Tsubaki? <br> It's me, Ogami. 
Huh? Ogami! <br> How'd you get my number? 
Yuri told me, actually. 
Oh, I see! I'm just a little surprised, getting called out of the blue like this. 
I just kept trying numbers till I found it. 
Really? Well thanks for going through all that trouble! 
OK, let's talk on the big screen! 
Wow, I can see you so clearly! 
Same here, I can see you very well on my end. 
Really? This feels kinda different from our usual chats at the shop. 
By the way, Ogami, did you need something from me? 
Wish her good luck.
Ask what she's doing. 
Ask her out on a date. 
I won't ask about what you're up to… but good luck all the same, Tsubaki. 
Y-Yes, sir! Thank you very much! 
I can't tell you what I'm working on, due to the nature of this assignment… 
But with you cheering me on, I know I'll do my best! 
I know I've asked this before, but… what exactly are you up to? 
I'm sorry. I can't tell you, not under any circumstances. 
I see… 
… 
…All right, Ogami, how about this? I'll tell you where I am, but that's it. 
Right now, I'm at the Imperial Assault Troupe's Hokkaido Headquarters. 
Huh? Hokkaido?! 
Yes. I can't say any more than that. Sorry. 
Tsubaki, when you get back, how about we go on a date? 
Huh? Are you serious, Ogami? 
OK then… Once I get back, I'll make sure to invite you out! 
No, nothing in particular. I just wanted to talk to you. 
O-Ogami… 
… 
… 
I… Um… I should go. Got work to do, bye! 
Ah! Tsubaki! 
<sp>
*sigh* <br> She hung up. 
At any rate, I wonder where she is and what she's doing. 
All right, Ogami, I'm in the middle of work, so I have to go. 
Tell everyone at the theater I said hi! 
Sure. Good luck with your work! 
Thank you! Call me again sometime! 
Tsubaki seems to be really giving it her all.
But still, I wonder what she's doing. 
… 
Tsubaki's not picking up. She must've gone back to work after all. 
Good afternoon. <br> It's time for Capital News. 
Days earlier, a battle broke out at Atami between the Imperial Assault Troop and the Black Demons. 
However, the site of this battle is currently enjoying somewhat of a boom in tourism. 
It's believed that the locals, who usually never get to see the troop in action… 
…are rushing to the site of their battle to do some sightseeing. 
However, it is still unclear as to why the Black Demon Society appeared in Atami… 
Nor how the Imperial Assault Troop were able to respond and arrive so quickly. 
We have with us an eyewitness from Atami to give us his side of the story. 
I never would've imagined I'd ever see the Imperial Assault Troop fight in a place like this… 
Figured I'd watch while they were here. I'd always wanted to see a robot battle in person.
Huh? Why did the Black Demons show up? 
Well, they must've come here for summer vacation! Ahahahaha! 
Next, news concerning the revised measurement law passed on July 1st last year. 
Following the enactment of the law, which adopted the metric system as the national standard… 
…elementary school textbooks have been using the metric system as of this April. 
However, the former shakkanhou system is still in wide use, both commercially and privately. 
This state of chaos caused by the two systems is likely to continue for some time. 
Finally, it's time for this week's weather forecast. 
A large typhoon is steadily approaching the Kanto region. 
A strong wind advisory has already been declared for the Tokyo metropolitan area. 
The typhoon is expected to arrive in the capital from midnight through dawn. 
Refrain from going outdoors tonight, and securely fasten your shutters before going to bed. 
That's it for Capital News, brought to you by the Capital Daily Report. 
This concludes our broadcast day. <br> Capital News, signing off. 
A red shadow opposes the evildoers lurking in the darkness of the capital. His name is Masked Red! 
Masked Red, the boy wonder of justice! Today he continues his fight for peace in the capital! 
Serial Radio Drama Masked Red, The Terrifying Mummy, Part 5 
“Y-You managed to escape those hellish sewers?! You're no ordinary boy!" 
“Prepare yourself, Dr. Kurogane! I'm putting an end to your schemes!" 
“How dare you, you insolent pest! Go, Mummy! My mightiest robot!" 
Blowing steam from its mouth, the mummy begins to pursue Masked Red! 
“I see, so that mummy was nothing more than a steam-powered contraption! In that case, take this!" 
Masked Red fires his Colt and blows open a hole in the mummy's abdomen. 
Water gushes forth from the opening, and before long, a hissing noise comes from the robot's body. 
“You fool! You're going to make its boiler explode!" 
Indeed, the mummy explodes, taking Dr. Kurogane's laboratory with it in the process. 
With the girls freed from the underground prison cells, Dr. Kurogane's scheme has been foiled! 
However, so long as evil remains in the world, Masked Red's battle never ends! 
Fight on, Masked Red! You're our hero, Red! <br> -The End 
Go, Masked Red! <br> Fight on, Masked Red! <br> Tune in next time! 
I'm worried about Reni… I should stop here. 
All right, where to next? 
Oh… 6 o'clock already… 
I should go and see Reni now.
OK, let's try talking to Reni. 
Tell me some gossip. 
I'll come back later. 
Oh yeah, Ogami, have you met Tsubomi, our new shopkeep, yet? 
Yeah, I just ran into her. She’s, uh, quite lively. 
Yes, she seems overjoyed to be working here. 
We have to be on our best behavior with a new girl on the team! 
By the way, Ogami, I have a huge scoop. 
A huge scoop, you say? 
Uh-huh! Tsubaki's out on a secret assignment but I have her call number! 
H-Huh?! You know her number? 
Yes, she has a transceiver on hand in case of emergency. 
Ready, Ogami? Her number is “13600.” 
13600… Got it. There, I got it written down. 
I went through a lot of trouble to get you that number, so you better give her a call! 
Yeah, of course. I'll make sure to contact her. 
Oh, I already figured out her number by myself. 13600, right? 
By yourself?! Wow, Ogami, you sure don't waste any time, do you? 
Wh-What's that supposed to mean? 
Hm hm, I'm sure Tsubaki was quite surprised to receive a call from you out of the blue. 
By the way, just where is Tsubaki, anyway? 
Heehee, about that… 
Yuri! That's top-secret, remember? 
Huh?! But I wanna tell him! It's OK if we only tell Ogami, right? 
Absolutely not. 
We'll tell you when the time is right, Ogami, so please just bear with us. 
…I-I understand. 
Oh yeah, Ogami, the Rose Division just finished setting up a room downstairs! 
When did they find the time to do that? 
They have all kinds of interesting stories. 
We might hear some exciting gossip from them, so let’s drop by and say hi every now and then!  
Oh boy, that's Yuri for you. 
It seems like this typhoon is hitting the Kanto region head-on. I'm worried. 
They're even telling everyone on the radio not to go out tonight. 
It's true, the scariest part of a storm like this isn't the rain, it's being hit by flying debris. 
Transit around the capital will come to a standstill, too. 
It's finally time for the autumn production to start, isn't it, Ogami. 
“The Blue Bird," right? I'm looking forward to it as well. 
It's Reni's big debut, all the patrons are talking about it. 
Ticket preorders are selling like hotcakes. 
Really? Guess everyone's looking forward to this performance. 
(But with Reni in the state she’s in right now, I wonder how it will turn out.) 
That's right, I heard some amazing news on the radio yesterday. 
Oh, you mean about that steam submarine? 
…Steam submarine? 
Yes, it seems that one of the Navy's steam submarines wouldn't resurface no matter what they tried.
Apparently, they finally pulled it out of the water with nothing but rope and manpower.
Wow, really? 
That's the honest truth. They said so on the news. 
How was your vacation last month, Ogami? 
It got pretty crazy, but I had a lot of fun. Wish you could've come with us. 
*sigh* <br> I bought a new swimsuit and everything, but I never got the chance to show it off. 
Oh? Didn't you swim in the underground pool while everyone was on vacation? 
Yeah, but that's just our pool. I'm not gonna find any cute boys to swim with there. 
Sorry, Ogami, but I'm all out of gossip for now. 
I'll have some more interesting tidbits to share another time, so look forward to it! 
I'll be back. Good luck with your work. 
OK. Thanks for coming, Ogami. 
Let me know if you hear any juicy stories!

Ayame and I almost never lived in the same household, even though we were sisters. 
Eh…? 
It's not so unusual, given our lineage. We have less a "family tree" and more a "family wisteria." 
Yet, I still knew that she was the type of person that would sacrifice her own well-being for others… 
Carrying everyone's burdens by herself… 
That's why, when I received the news that she had passed away, I made up my mind. 
I want to carry on her will. I want to protect the capital, just like she did. 
And for my own sake, too. 
…I suppose that's all I have to say. 
You know, Ogami, I came here to work of my own volition. 
To protect the peace of this city, and to cherish our audience's smiles. 
I'm sure you feel the same, Ogami. 
Yes, of course. 
So let's both do our best. 
For my sister… <br> For everyone… 
Yes, ma'am! 
Well, today I will tell you about the Anti-Kouma Corps. 
The Anti-Kouma Corps was the Army's predecessor to the Imperial Assault Troupe. 
Ikki Yoneda, Kazuma Shinguji, Shinnosuke Yamazaki, and… Ayame Fujieda. 
A special unit, comprising only those four, formed to defend the capital from evil. 
Seven years ago… A Kouma appeared in Nihonbashi. 
Even though it was just a single Kouma, the military and police were powerless against it. 
However, the Anti-Kouma Corps managed to seal the Kouma away, albeit at great cost. 
That incident made the government painfully aware of the need to defend against such evil. 
As a result, the Imperial Assault Troupe as you know it was born. 
The troupe is the fruit of the Anti-Kouma Corps' will. 
And, of the four members, only General Yoneda is still alive today. 
For the sake of those four, who protected the people from evil… We have to keep fighting. 
… 
Now then, today I'll tell you about Ayame's travels. 
In order to recruit members for the Flower Division, Ayame traveled around the world. 
She searched for suitable Flower Division candidates, girls with powerful spiritual abilities.
She sent me letters from various countries. America, France, China… 
Whenever she did, I must be honest, I envied her. 
I see, so she did all that… 
Those same candidates make up the Flower Division we have now. 
And you know what, Ogami? Recently, I've been thinking… 
The people Ayame chose truly were the best people for the job. That includes you. 
Kaede… 
Ayame entrusted the Flower Division to me, so I'll continue to give it my all. 
Don't give up. Even in the hardest of times, remember to never give up, Ogami. 
Yes, ma'am! I will do all I can to meet your expectations! 
Now then, today I'll tell you about Ayame and Major Yamazaki. 
Both Ayame and Major Yamazaki were members of the troupe's predecessor, the Anti-Kouma Corps.
Major Yamazaki was a brilliant scientist who created the foundational designs for Spirit Armor… 
And they say he had a stronger sense of justice than most. 
Anyone could see that Ayame and Major Yamazaki were deeply in love with each other… 
But their relationship crumbled when the Kouma War started. 
What could have possibly caused that? 
Now, this is pure conjecture… 
But it seems that during their battles, Major Yamazaki became obsessed with certain questions.
“What are these demons?" "Why do they exist?" 
And "how are they so powerful?" 
General Yoneda noticed that Major Yamazaki had changed, and he warned him many times. 
But, in the end, no one could change his mind. 
Not even Ayame… 
When the Kouma War ended seven years ago, Major Yamazaki went missing. 
And then in our recent battles, he appeared again as Aoi Satan. 
Justice by power… <br> Rule through evil… 
Perhaps that was his conclusion… 
Back when he appeared in front of the theater six months ago… 
I wonder what Aoi Satan… No, what Major Yamazaki was trying to tell us… 
…
