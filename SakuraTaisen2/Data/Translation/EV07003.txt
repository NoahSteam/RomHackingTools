Reni…
The Imperial Assault Troupe has arrived!!
I brought everyone with me, Mon Frère!
Iris filled us in on the situation, Captain.
Reni's being manipulated by Saki Kageyama… By Suiko…
We're helpin' out too, Boss! We'll bring Reni back to her senses!
No, wait… <br> Leave Reni to me, I'll talk to her.
Huh?! But Ogami, why?
When Reni confided her worries to me… I didn't give her a good enough answer.
So that's why, this time… <br> I have to save her!
…Understood. <br> We'll leave her in your hands, Captain.
In the meantime, we'll hold the enemies off until you've talked Reni down!
Mon Frère, please… <br> Please bring Reni back to her normal self…
Yeah, I've got this.<br>I'll get Reni out of there.
