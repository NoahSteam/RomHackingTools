Come here, Iris. You can sit at my desk. 
OK! 
Wow, your desk is so big, Mon Frère. 
Hahaha, it is pretty big but I don't actually use it that often. 
Now… How should we write this letter? 
Uhm… You can tell me what you want to say… 
…and I'll write it in French. 
OK, got it. 
All right, Mon Frère. First, we need you to say hello to Papa and Mama. 
Say hello, huh… <br> In that case, let's start with an introduction. 
“I hope this letter finds you well. I am Ichiro Ogami…” 
Captain of the division. 
Iris's boyfriend. 
The ticket puncher. 
“…captain of the Imperial Assault Troupe’s Flower Division." 
“Ichiro Ogami… captain of… Assault Troupe." 
Is that too formal? 
Nuh-huh. I think it's nice to write like how you usually say things. 
“…Iris's boyfriend." 
Tee-hee! <br> You're so bold, Mon Frère! 
But I already told Papa and Mama that you’re my boyfriend.
I’ve mentioned it several times in my letters, so don’t worry about it.
I… I see… 
“…the theater’s ticket puncher." 
Thought it'd be fun to start with a little joke. What do you think?
Hehe! I wrote the same thing in my previous letter! 
But it's funny, so we should mention it again! 
… 
…What's wrong, Mon Frère? 
Hm… How should I introduce myself? I'm not sure. 
I'll write it for you! 
“Mon Frère is the… of…" 
Hey now, what are you writing? 
Ehehe. <br> It’s… a… secret!
Now, what should we say next? 
Oh, oh. Write something about me next! 
OK, I’ll do that. <br> Let’s see… 
“It is my conviction that you must be worried about Iris." 
“It is my conviction…" <br> Mon Frère, what does "con-vic-tion" mean? 
Hmm. Let's replace it with "I'm sure," then. 
Got it. <br> So, what's next? 
Let's see… <br> "Iris is…" 
Doing quite well.
A vital asset to the team. 
She bothers everyone.
Doing quite well. 
A vital asset to the team. 
She went on a rampage. 
Doing quite well. 
Really cute. 
She bothers everyone. 
Doing quite well. 
Really cute. 
She went on a rampage. 
“Iris is doing quite well." 
Should I also say that you're quite the bundle of energy? 
Whaaat? That's how you talk about a little kid. 
I'm a grown-up, so don't say that! 
Hahaha. Sorry, sorry. 
“Iris is doing her best and is a vital asset of the Flower Division." 
"Be it onstage or during battle, Iris is a devoted teammate. Rest assured that she's flourishing here."
“…devoted teammate… rest assured…" 
Ehehehe, thanks for praising me like that, Mon Frère. I'm so happy! 
“Iris is very cute." 
Tee-hee! Thank you, Mon Frère! 
Hahaha, I think they might be pretty surprised reading this letter. 
“Iris is often selfish and bothers everyone." 
I'm not selfish! I don't wanna write that! 
That's what I meant by "being selfish," Iris. 
I need to tell your parents the full story of how you're doing here. 
Oh… Fine…
“Iris is…" 
Are you sure you wrote that properly? 
Check it yourself! 
“Iris is selfish and bothers everyone." 
“Today, she went on a rampage in the salon." 
But I wasn't being selfish. I don't wanna write that. 
And I don't wanna make Papa and Mama worry about me… 
I-I see. You have a point there. 
OK then, let's omit the part about the rampage. 
Yeah. That's better. 
… 
…What's wrong, Mon Frère? 
Hmm… I'm still thinking about what I should write. 
How about I write, "Iris is doing good"? 
R-Right. I think that'd be nice. 
OK, now for the conclusion. "I promise to…"
… 
Protect Iris. 
Ensure Iris’s happiness. 
Make sure Iris behaves. 
“No matter what kind of enemy stands before her…"
"No matter what kind of problem she may have to face…"
“I promise that I will do my best to protect Iris."
“She will always be a very precious friend to us."
…I guess that sounds a little showy, but what do you think?
Mon Frère… Thank you. 
I promise to do my best too!
"I still don’t know exactly what I can do for Iris, but…"
"I promise to ensure her happiness."
…It's a bit short, but what do you think? 
Mon Frère… Thank you.
I'm sure Papa and Mama will be happy, too. 
“I promise to make sure Iris behaves herself." 
That makes it sound like I'm being a bad kid! 
And I'm not a little kid anymore! 
Uh… OK. Let's change it to, "I promise to look after her." 
Got it. <br> "I promise… look after her." 
I'm not sure how to put it into words right now…
But the point is, I’ll continue to do my best for your sake, Iris. 
…OK, got it! 
I'll write it just like that. I'm sure Papa and Mama will get it! 
…Well now, is this OK? 
Yeah! Thank you, Mon Frère! 
You're welcome. 
Honestly, I think you're pretty brave, Iris.
Huh? Why do you say that? 
You’re always so cheerful, even though you live so far away from your parents.
You even write them letters so they don’t have to worry about you. I’m impressed. 
… 
No… <br> That’s… not true. 
The thing is… Before I came here, I had to stay inside a castle for a long time. 
…A castle? 
Yeah, when I was really little… I didn’t know how to control my power…
I was a bother to everyone, so I shut myself in my room, all alone. 
I see… 
I always wanted to play and go out with my papa and mama, but…
I couldn’t do anything except talk to Jean-Paul and his friends over and over again. 
… 
I’m not brave at all. <br> I’m just… <br> I’m just really lonely. 
Speak kindly to her. 
Cheer her up. 
Speak kindly to her. 
Encourage her. 
Sniff… 
Iris… 
Iris, you've been lonely for a long time. 
I never realized how hard it was for you. 
Sniff… 
I wish I could have been with you back then. 
Sniff… But now we're together, hehe. 
Yeah, now we're together. So, Iris… 
You can cheer up now. I'm with you. 
Mon Frère… 
Cheer up, Iris. A sad face doesn't suit you! 
I-Is that so…? 
That's right. You look so cute when you smile! 
Ehehehe… Are you sure? 
Of course. Besides, you're not alone anymore. 
The Flower Division and I will always be with you. 
Yeah… Thank you, Mon Frère! 
Ehehe, I'll always be together with you! 
Hahaha. You were just crying, but look at you now, beaming from ear to ear. 
Ehehe. It's because I'm so happy now! Everything's all good!
Iris, I need you to listen. 
You were all by yourself back then, but now, you have me and everyone else in the Flower Division. 
You're not alone anymore, all right? 
Mon Frère… 
Sorry, Iris. I can't find the right words to say, but… 
I'll try to look after you as much as I can. 
Mon Frère… 
I could never replace your parents…
But what I can do is always be by your side. 
We can chat, go out, and play together. 
You're a precious friend to everyone in the Flower Division, not just me. 
We won't let you be alone anymore. 
Mon Frère… 
Phew, it's getting late. Let's get to bed. 
Mon Frère, u-um… <br> Can I ask for one more thing? 
Oh? What is it? 
Can I… sleep in your room tonight? 
Sure, no problem. 
That'll be a problem. 
Sure, no problem. <br> We can share my room. 
Yay! Thank you, Mon Frère! 
That… may be a problem. 
It's fiiine! <br> I won't tell Sakura, OK? 
R-Right… 
U-Uhm… What should I do? 
Ah! Mon Frère, you're blushing! That's cute! 
I won't tell anyone, Mon Frère. I'll just go to sleep right away! Good niiight! 
H-Hey, Iris! 
OK, good night, Mon Frère! 
OK… Good night, Iris. 
Ehehe! <br> This makes me so happy… 
… 
Hey, Mon Frère… 
Yes, Iris? 
Let's play together some time… 
OK, I promise. 
A promise is a promise… <br> And Mon Frère, please stay… 
…by my side… always… 
… 
Yes… I'll always be there for you. 
Good night, Iris. 
Uh… It's morning already? 
Zzz… Zzz… 
Iris? Oh yeah, last night she asked to stay in my room. 
Hm… Mmmmmmm… 
Hahaha, what a cute face. She looks so innocent. 
Iris, wake up. <br> It's morning. 
Hmmm… 
…Huh? Mon Frère? 
Yaaaawn… <br> So I was dreaming, huh. 
Morning, Iris. <br> Did you sleep well? 
Yeah! I slept really well! 
Mon Frère, I saw you in my dream! 
Oh… 
What did you dream about? 
I had a dream, too. 
Ask for a performance fee. 
What did you dream about? 
I saw you in my dream, too. 
Ask for a performance fee. 
What did you dream about? 
Tee-hee, it's a secret! 
OK. Then, was it a nice dream? 
Yeah. A super nice one! 
I think… I had a dream, too. 
You had a dream as well, Mon Frère? What did you dream about? 
Uhm… What was it… 
Huh. I think I forgot. 
You forgot? Aw… <br> I wanted to hear about it. 
What was it like, huh? Should I ask for a performance fee? 
Whaaat!? <br> Mon Frère, you meanie!! 
Hahaha, just kidding. As long as it's not a bad dream, that's good enough for me. 
Yeah! Of course it was a good dream! 
Me too. I saw you in my dream last night. 
What? You saw me… in your dream? 
Yeah. I forgot how it went… 
…but the thing I remember most is seeing you. 
Perhaps we shared a dream last night. 
Yeah! I think so, too! That must be it! 
Mon Frère… Do you want to know what I dreamt about? 
I'd like to. But if you tell other people, your dream won’t come true. 
What, is that true?! 
Then I won't tell! I absolutely, absolutely won't tell anyone! 
… 
Thank you, Mon Frère. 
I’m not… lonely anymore. 
…Glad to hear it. 
All right, how about we go get some breakfast? 
Yeah! 
Ah, Sakura’s here! <br> Good morning!
I-Iris… 
Good morning, Sakura. Looks like it'll be a pleasant morning. 
Ogami… 
Come on, you two! Let's hurry up and eat breakfast! 
You're right. OK, let's have a big meal to start the day! 
…Yeah! 
Oh, hello, everyone. <br> Good morning.
Hey, you’re up early, Ogami. You getting some grub too? 
Good morning, sir. <br> Huh? What’s with the uniform? Are you going out somewhere?
Yup, I’ve got some things to take care of at the Ministry of the Army. Saki’s tagging along too.
Iris, how about you ask the manager to help send your letter? 
What’s this, a letter? Sure, I can mail this out for you. 
Really, Uncle? <br> You’d do that for me?
Of course, not a problem. Anything for my adorable Iris. 
Thank you so much, Uncle! 
The alarm?! 
It's early in the morning, but our enemies are still coming, huh. 
Ogami, I have to go to the ministry. The Flower Division is in your hands. 
Understood, sir! 
Iris, I'll make sure to send this letter, so don't worry. 
Yeah! I'm counting on you, Uncle! 
Yup, you can count on me. I'm off…<br>
Uh-oh. 
What's wrong, sir? 
Aw, my shoelace just snapped is all. It's not a big deal. 
Oh my… <br> I'm afraid that's a sign of bad luck. 
Well then, sir, we're heading out for our mission. 
OK. Watch yourselves out there! 
Yeah! I'm gonna do my best today! 
It's time to move out! Ogami, Iris, let's go! 
The Imperial Assault Troupe, Flower Division has assembled! 
Where’s the enemy been sighted?
Shibuya, according to our intel. 
It appears that Hex Mechs have been transporting some kind of material in large quantities.
If they’re in Shibuya, we can move out in the Thunderstrike! 
Thunderstrike? What's that? 
It's the pride of the Imperial Assault Troupe, an underground train used for transporting Koubu. 
It's a bullet train, so it can take us to our destination in no time. 
What do you think the enemy is planning to do with all that material they're transporting? 
They have to be assembling something! 
We should attack them right away before they have time to mount a defense. 
…We could also choose to observe the enemy’s movements to see what their objective is. 
(Hmm… Which strategy should we use?) 
Destroy the enemy now. 
Wait and collect intel. 
We'll destroy the enemy immediately. We're not gonna just let the Society do as they please!
We'll also destroy all the material they've gathered. 
We better hold back and wait for more intel. 
We still don't know their objective yet, so we shouldn't act too carelessly. 
The troupe's intelligence team, the Moon Division, is currently doing recon for us. 
… 
This just in from the Moon Division… The enemy's objective is to build a forward operating base.
They’ve marked the containers we need to destroy, so just focus on those.
Understood, destroy the marked containers. 
Roger! 
Mon Frère, give the order, please! 
Assault Troupe, move out! 
We're headed out, Iris! 
Imperial Assault Troupe, we're moving out! Our destination is Shibuya! 
Let's do our best, Ogami! 
This will be a good chance to exercise a bit before breakfast! 
Preparation for sortie, completed. 
I absolutely won't lose today! 
Mon Frère is with me, so I can't lose! 
We're heading out, Iris. Are you ready? 
Yeah! I'm good to go! 
Are you all set too, Mon Frère? Don't leave anything behind, OK? 
Hahaha. All right, we're moving out! 
Yaaaawn… Crap, that was quite the yawn. 
Ogami, don't tell me you were pulling an all-nighter. 
Actually, Sakura, last night Mon Frère was… 
Aaaaah! Iris, hold it! 
Oh… Right. It's supposed to be a secret. 
…? 
A-Anyway, Imperial Assault Troupe, move out! 
OK. I'm done with my business. And I just sent out Iris's letter, too. 
I'm a bit worried about the Black Demon Society. Well, Ogami's on the case. I'm sure he has it handled.
Now, back to the theater. 
Wh-What kind of sick joke is this… I’m going back… to… the theater. 
My precious children… They're all… waiting for me there… 
I’m not about to… kick the bucket… in a place like this!!
