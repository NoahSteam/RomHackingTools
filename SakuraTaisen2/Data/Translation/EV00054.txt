Say, Mon Frère… I'm so happy you've come back to us.
Do you know why? It's 'cause I've grown up in a lot of different ways…
You got taller, right?
Did Jean-Paul get taller?
I see… You got taller, right?
Yes! I’m 9 centimeters taller now!
That's wonderful, Iris.
I see… Did Jean-Paul get taller?
What?! Jean-Paul didn't grow at all.
O-Oh, all right then.
You're so weird…
…You're right. Your Koubu Kai is a real step up!
You're just avoiding my question!
