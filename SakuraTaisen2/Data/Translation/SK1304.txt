Sleep soundly. 
I think… I see… something… from the past. 
Seems like… it was a… nice dream… 
Yaaawn… <br> Whew, I had a nice sleep. 
But, still… <br> That was a nostalgic dream.

Mon Frère! 
Ah, Chief… 
Mr. Ensign…

Mumble, mumble…

Yo, Ogami. Dreaming sure is lovely, isn’t it?
Eeep?! 
…?! 
Ka-Kayama! Huh?
Wa…?!
Dreams are always like that, Ogami. 
“In spring, one sleeps a sleep that knows no dawn." It might be nice to just continue dreaming.
However, Ogami, there are even more ways to enjoy the holiday.
Try swapping your CD for Disc 2 and select “Long Day.”
Huh? Wha… What are you talking about?
Switch to Disc 2 and select “Long Day.” Don’t forget.
Well then, see you later, Ogami.
Ahh, what a joy it is to be able to see you even in your dream!
Ugh… 
Huh?! It was… a dream… 
Uh… To think I’d dream of Kayama of all people…
OK, this time… I’m gonna meet 
in my dream… 
Mumble, mumble… 
… 

Yo, Ogami! 
Uwaaaaah! N-Not you again, Kayama! 
What was that, Ogami?! I can’t believe that’s the first thing you have to say after our reunion. So cold.
…Never mind. I'll tell you once again. 
Switch to Disc 2 in order to select "Long Day." OK? Got it?
Well now, Ogami. I'll see you later. Adiós! 
Ugh… 
I dreamt about Kayama again… 
Thi… This time… I’m gonna meet 
in my dream… 
Mumble, mumble…

Yo, Ogami! 
…Not again. 
What do you mean, "not again," Ogami?! And right after we were reunited. You're so cold.
…Never mind. I'll tell you once again. 
Switch to Disc 2 in order to select "Long Day." OK? Got it?
Well now, Ogami. I'll see you later. Adiós! 
Ugh…

It’s a holiday… Maybe I’ll catch a few more winks…
Yo, Ogami. Dreaming sure is lovely, isn’t it?
Ka… Kayama!
