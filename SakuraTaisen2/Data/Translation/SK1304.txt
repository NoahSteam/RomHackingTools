So sorry, Mr. Ogami, but each customer is only allowed to purchase one photo at a time.

Yo, Ogami. Dreaming sure is lovely, isn’t it?
Eeep?! 
...?! 
Ka-Kayama! Huh?
Wa…?!
Dreams are always like that, Ogami. 
“In spring, one sleeps a sleep that knows no dawn." It might be nice to just continue dreaming.
However, Ogami, there are even more ways to enjoy the holiday.
Try swapping your CD for Disc 2 and select “Long Day.”
Huh? Wha… What are you talking about?
Switch to Disc 2 and select “Long Day.” Don’t forget.
Well then, see you later, Ogami.
Ahh, what a joy it is to be able to see you even in your dream!
Ugh... 
Huh?! It was... a dream… 
Uh… To think I’d dream of Kayama of all people…
OK, this time… I’m gonna meet 
in my dream... 
Mumble, mumble...

Yo, Ogami! 
Uwaaaaah! N-Not you again, Kayama! 
What was that, Ogami?! I can’t believe that’s the first thing you have to say after our reunion. So cold.
...Never mind. I'll tell you once again. 
Switch to Disc 2 in order to select "Long Day." OK? Got it?
Well now, Ogami. I'll see you later. Adiós! 
Ugh... 
I dreamt about Kayama again...
