Fwohohoho! How does it feel to be on the receiving end of the Grand Imperial Theater's defenses?
With the combined power of the impregnable Imperial Theater Defensive Wall…
And the overwhelming firepower of my weaponry, none shall pass.
Fwohohoho… According to my calculations, you will perish here.
Ogami, if we don't do something about their weapons, we won't be able to reach the theater.
I know Kayama will stop the cannons for us. We just have to believe in him.
I can't believe the enemy's managed to take over the theater's defensive wall…
I know Kayama will lower the wall for us. We just have to believe in him.
