According to Kayama, the others should be barricaded in the command room. 
Ogami… Don’t you think it’s a little too quiet?
Yeah, you’re right… <br> What happened to all those soldiers?
Don't let your guard down, Sakura. This might be a trap. 
As long as I have my blade, Arataka, I'll be fine.
OK… Let’s go.
Is everyone all right?! We're here to help! 
Aaah! Mon Frère! Sakura!! 
You're late! <br> Finally, you show up! 
Hey, what happened to that bunch on the upper floor? Don't tell me you finished them all by yourselves. 
About that… Nobody was around when we got here.
What did you say?!
For so many soldiers to suddenly disappear… <br> What could it mean?
No idea. However, the person fighting us earlier was one of the Society's Five Elements, Mokujiki.
I suppose we can assume… that the Black Demon Society is involved in this incident somehow.
I knew it… <br> Sorry we were unable to lend you our support, Captain.
No, it’s all right. We had the new Spirit Armor with us, the Tendu.
I see, so the Tenbu have finally been completed!
A single Tenbu has the strength of hundreds! With these, we have nothing to fear even from the Society!
…Wait! <br> Someone else is here!
Hehehe… <br> Excellent as always, Imperial Assault Troupe. A splendid display indeed.
…That voice! 
It’s been a long time, hasn't it… Ensign Ichiro Ogami. 
You… <br> Army Minister Kyogoku! 
I can’t believe it… <br> Are you the one leading this coup d’etat?!
Hehehe… <br> “Coup d’etat” is such an ugly phrase.
I'd prefer you call our operation a restoration. The Taisho Restoration.
What on earth are you doing here?
I only came to give my regards. A defensive line, such as this, is of no use to me. 
Heed me… <br> The capital is already within my grasp.
Stop joking around!
This is no joke, Sakura Shinguji.
Open your eyes. Don’t waste your power on such trifles as “justice.”
You’ll end up dying a dog’s death, just like your father.
Wha… <br> What did you just say?! 
Not once, but twice you’ve ridiculed my father… <br> I won’t allow it!!
Sakura! 
Draw your sword!!
I said draw your sword, Keigo Kyogoku!!
…Heh. You think you have what it takes to kill a man? To kill another human in the flesh?
…Rrrgh! <br> If you won’t draw your sword… Then I’ll make you!
Haaaaaah! 
Wha… What?! 
I won’t let you lay a finger on Lord Kyogoku…
De… Demon King!! 
…Step aside!
It's futile… <br> Your skills are nothing compared to mine. 
This fight will only make my sword, Mukei, rust.
Heh heh heh… <br> This is an amusing battle.
However, Demon King, it is time to initiate the next phase of our plan. Withdraw for now.
…As you wish.
Now then, ladies and gentlemen of the Imperial Assault Troupe… I’m afraid I must be on my way.
Wait! 
Child… Push yourself to hone your swordsmanship.
At your current level, you have no hope in taking the life of another…
… 
Sakura… 
Lord Kyogoku… <br> The Taisho Restoration Army has nearly been quelled.
Of course they have. <br> They never stood a chance.
By throwing Tokyo into disarray, they have done enough. They’ve served their purpose.
Our preparations are already complete…
I see… 
Then I shall proceed to release the seal that has been placed on Shinjuku. 
Heh heh heh… <br> The time is near. Soon, the TRUE Tokyo will awaken.
At any rate, I’m just glad you’re all OK.
But, Commander Yoneda… 
…Yeah, I know. <br> First, let’s take stock of the situation.
Ogami. Is there anything you would like to ask?
Ask about Kyogoku. 
Ask about the coup. 
Ask about the Regalia. 
I’d like to ask about Kyogoku…
Hmm. There’s no mistake, Kyoguku was the mastermind behind this upheaval.
On top of that, he even confronted us with the Demon King in tow.
Which means… 
Which means, the Black Demon Society is under his command.
Damn it, Kyogoku… <br> To think he would take things this far.
What’s the status of the coup d’etat forces?
I just received word from Minister Yamaguchi that the Navy has begun to suppress their efforts.
Squads in Yokohama, Kofu, and Maebashi have linked up and formed a perimeter around Tokyo.
That so? Then it's only a matter of time before the coup fails. 
No, we can't lower our guard. 
Not until we capture the one responsible for all this chaos.
Keigo Kyogoku… 
Commander Yoneda, what about the remaining pieces of the Regalia?
They’ve… fallen into enemy hands.
My apologies, Commander… <br> My team allowed this to happen…
Come on, we managed to secure the jewel thanks to your quick wit. 
We just need to take back what was stolen. That's all there is to it.
… 
…Commander Yoneda. 
If you don't mind… <br> Please tell me more about the Pandemonium Regalia. 
And also… about the Power of Purification. 
Sakura… 
… 
…I understand.
The Pandemonium Regalia… The ultimate sacred instruments that amplify the power of their wielder. 
Throughout the Taisho Era, there are only two people that have ever used them…
One of them was Aoi Satan… Who used to be known as Shinnosuke Yamazaki. 
Two years ago, he amplified his own power through the use of the Regalia…
…and was able to resurrect the Sacred Demon Castle from the sea. It's still fresh in all our memories.
The other person was Kazuma Shinguji. Your father, Sakura…
… 
Seven years ago… <br> When a Kouma appeared in Nihonbashi during the Great Kouma War… 
Kazuma, with the help of the Regalia… used the Power of Purification.
The power is said to put an unimaginable burden on the mind and body of its user.
Kazuma departed from this world only three months after the war…
The Pandemonium Regalia's power is beyond human… 
We can't let the Black Demon Society get a hold of something so dangerous!
Ichiro, that’s why… <br> We beg you!
You have to get it back… <br> The rest of the Regalia…
Everyone… 
Roger that! 
But where are they?
Roger that! I promise that we'll retrieve the rest of the Regalia!
Ensign Ogami… <br> Thank you so much!
When you get the Regalia back, I’ll give you a kiss!
Please… <br> Do your best everyone! 
But, we don’t know the whereabouts of the other pieces…
No need to worry about that. The Regalia emits a strong spiritual energy.
If we can locate that energy’s transmission point…
We’ll find the Regalia’s location in no time!
I-I see… 
We still have the jewel with us. 
The Society can’t do anything without all three pieces of the Regalia. This isn’t over yet!
The rest of Regalia… Two treasures we couldn't protect… 
Ichiro… Make sure to retrieve them, OK? 
…O-Of course. 
Commander Yoneda! The steam processor’s spirit radar has detected something…
We’re picking up a spirit power reading that we believe to be the Regalia!
Is that so?! <br> Where’s it coming from?
Location: Shinjuku. It appears that both of the remaining pieces are there!
Hm, so it’s finally our turn to make a move.
Now, Ogami! <br> Give the order to sortie!
Assault Troupe, move out!
Take back the Regalia!
Imperial Assault Troupe, move out! Our destination is Shinjuku! 
Roger! 
We're counting on you, Ogami! 
Everyone… We're gonna take back the Regalia! 
Roger! 
Ensign Ogami… 
And everyone in the Flower Division… 
Please take care of the Pandemonium Regalia! 
Hey Ogami! Are you dozing off or what?!
Ah… S-Sorry! 
Imperial Assault Troupe, move out! Our destination is… 
Err… What was it again? 
It's Shinjuku, Ogami… Pull yourself together. 
Oh brother… What does the future have in store for us?
OK, start the Tenbu! We're gonna take the Pandemonium Regalia back from Kyogoku! 
Sorry Ogami, but customers are only allowed to purchase one of each bromide. 
I see. That's too bad. 
So sorry, Mr. Ogami, but customers are only allowed to purchase one of each bromide.
Oh, really? That's too bad.
