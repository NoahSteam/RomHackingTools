Boss… <br> Thanks for choosing me.
By the way, can I ask why you picked me for your team?
You're reliable.
You're strong.
 Because you’re reliable, of course. I feel so reassured when I'm with you.
R-Really, ya do? Now ya got me blushin’…
Well, if ya expect that much outta me, I guess I just gotta hunker down and get it done! 
Yeah. I'm counting on you, Kanna.
I chose you because you're strong. When it comes to attacking and pulverizing, no one can match you.
Hahaha! <br> Right, I excel at those things.
Well, no need to worry as long as I'm around. Let's do this, Boss!
Yeah. I'm counting on you, Kanna.
No particular reason. I just wanted us to fight together. Is that not enough?
Hahaha! <br> That's just so like you. <br> I love it!
Well now, Boss, let's do this!
Yeah. I'm counting on you, Kanna.
