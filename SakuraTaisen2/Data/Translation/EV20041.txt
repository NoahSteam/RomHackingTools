Yes, I did it!
You did it! I knew you could, Ogami.
We're not done yet… We have no idea how powerful the enemies waiting for us in Musashi will be.
I'll do my best to help keep you on your feet!
After all, I want to be with you for as long as I can…
Sakura…
OK, we're almost there! Let's give it our all, Ogami!
Hohoho, marvelously done as always, Ensign.
Well, we're not out of the woods yet. This doesn't change the fact that we're at a disadvantage.
Indeed… And it's for precisely that reason that I do not wish to fight with any regrets remaining.
Yet… With you by my side, Ensign, I know I've nothing at all to fear.
Sumire…
Now, just a little further! Let us be off, Ensign!
Yeah!
You did it, Captain. Nicely done.
Well, the only reason I can focus on fighting is because you're here backing me up.
I feel the same… I can fight without worry knowing you're here with me.
Maria…
Now then, we're just a few steps from victory! Let's stay sharp and give it our all!
Yeah.
Now that's my boss! Outdone yourself again, eh?
Haha, must be thanks to all that sparring with you.
Heheheh… That's where puttin' in the effort every day'll get ya.
Still though… You're lookin' way cooler than usual!
O-Oh yeah…?
C'mon, Boss, we're nearly there! Get yourself nice 'n fired up, and let's push through to the end!
Yeah!
You did it, Mon Frère! You're sooo cool!
Thanks, Iris! It's all because you cheered me on.
Of course! I mean, you are my boyfriend after all.
So I'll be here by your side, no matter what!
And I will, too! Let's give it our all from here on, Iris!
Yeah, let's do our very best together!
Yeah, you and me!
I knew you had this in the bag, Chief! You're on a roll!
Nah, it's thanks to all the maintenance you do on the Tenbu.
Heheheh, I appreciate the kind words!
I keep that Tenbu of yours in tip-top shape so you can fight your heart out without a second thought!
Besides, I'm sticking by you no matter what, so there's no need to worry.
Kohran…
Welp, it's sink or swim now. Let's give it all we've got!
Yeah! Let's go, Kohran!
Nicely done there, Mr. Ensign!
Hahaha… Well, I can't let you show me up just yet, Orihime.
Why of course not! To fight like you're giving a brilliant solo is the Star Division's motto!
But I suppose us two could have a short duet together.
Orihime…
Now then Mr. Ensign, let us give these petty little foes the finish they deserve!
Yeah, let's give it our all, Orihime!
That was a good move, Captain…
We're not done yet… We have no idea how powerful the enemies waiting for us in Musashi will be.
Besides, this is a fight for the entire Flower Division. It would mean nothing if I fought alone.
Yes. Battles must be fought with forethought in mind…
…but you also keep your allies in your thoughts while fighting, too. You're an outstanding leader.
Reni…
Captain… I'm no longer a disposable chess piece, am I?
That's right. You're my dear companion.
Yes… Let's fight on together, Captain.
