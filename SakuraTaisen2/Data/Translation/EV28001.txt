The Imperial Assault Troupe has arrived!!
It's just as they said, the enemy's transporting materials to build a base…
According to the Moon Division's intel, we need to destroy the containers marked in blue.
And they said the ones marked in red are dangerous.
While the ones with white marks should be able to heal us.
All right, everyone, let's go after those blue containers.
