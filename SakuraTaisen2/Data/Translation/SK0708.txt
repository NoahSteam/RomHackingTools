I'll put the flowers right here, Papa. 
OK. Thank you, Orihime. 
But still, talk about a dramatic change. 
To think this is the same Orihime who'd always call Japanese men "spineless" or "stupid"... 
E-Ensign! That's ancient history! Forget about that already! 
It just goes to show, Japanese men are indelicato! 
Hahaha... There's the Orihime I know. 
... 
By the way, I have a favor I'd like to ask of you two... 
Seeing you two together like this has given me the sudden urge to draw. 
Once I get discharged from the hospital, would you two model for me? 
Huh?! 
I know it'd make for a great picture. 
Papa... 
Ogami, once again, please look after Orihime for me. 
Yes, sir! 
Ahh... However, if you ever plan on marrying Orihime, you'd better prepare yourself. 
After all, I'm sure you've noticed how strong-willed Italian women can be. 
...R-Right. 
Oh, stop it, Papa! Talking about marriage... Heeheehee! 
Sorry, Ogami, but each customer is only allowed to purchase one photo at a time. 
I see. That's too bad.
