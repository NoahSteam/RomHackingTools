Ah, you missed the answer! Too bad. 
Wrong answer. You still have a long way to go, Ogami. 
Wrong answer, Ogami. 
Looks like ordinary method doesn't work, does it, Ogami? 
Too bad for you. It was a bit difficult part. 
Time's out! Too bad for you. 
You shouldn't think too much, just answer it right away. 
Ah, that's too bad. Your time is up. 
Ogami, it's okay if you just use your hunch to answer difficult question. You need to answer them quickly.

Oh, Ogami. Good morning. 
Good morning. Did you sleep well last night? 
Good morning. I slept like a log, thankfully. 
Breakfast is almost ready, so wait just a little longer. 
Thanks. I'll go get changed, then. 
I'll wake him up! 
Zzz... Zzz... 
Wake up, Ogami, it's morning. 
Ah, good morning, Sakura. 
Good morning. Did you sleep well? 
Yeah, I slept soundly, thankfully. 
Really? Hmhm, glad to hear it. 
We finished making breakfast, so get changed and come to the living room, OK? 
Just 5 more minutes... 
Oh, Ogami, you're hopeless. 
We finished making breakfast, so get changed and come to the living room, OK? 
Hurry up before it gets cold!

Wake up, dear... It's morning...

Eek! O-Ogami... Were you awake this whole time?! 
Oh, jeez... Hurry and get up already! It's time for breakfast! 
OK, let's eat! 
There's plenty to go around, so eat as much as you'd like! 
Sakura made this breakfast almost entirely by herself. 
Hmhm, I tried to make it just like Mother's! 
*chew* *chew* 
... 
Well, Ogami...? How does it taste? 
It's great! This is delicious, Sakura! 
Really? Thank you so much! 
You've gotten quite good at seasoning, haven't you, Sakura? 
Thanks! I practiced while at the theater so that I can recreate your recipes, Mother. 
Though I do think the miso soup could stand to be a bit lighter. 
Huh, really? OK, you'll have to teach me how afterward! 
Um... It's OK. 
I-Is that right...? 
... 
I think the miso soup should've been a bit lighter. 
I'll teach you the trick to making it later. 
Your father was used to be finicky when it comes to miso soup. 
Wow... You absolutely have to tell me! 
I want to cook just like you... The way Father liked it! 
Hmm... Is it good or is it not... 
Come on, Ogami, which one is it? 
I think the miso soup should've been a bit lighter. 
I'll teach you the trick to making it later. 
Your father was used to be finicky when it comes to miso soup.

Back then, when I was about to be engaged, 
I called you at the night before the marriage meeting, Ensign. 
Sumire, it's you. Why are you calling so late at night? 
Ensign... 
Between myself and the Imperial Assault Troupe, which is more important to you? 
Wh-What in the world? This came out of nowhere. 
Please, answer me, Ensign. 
Sumire. 
I mean... Both are important to me. But if I had to, I'd choose you, Sumire. 
... 
Ensign... 
I mean... Both are important to me. But if I had to, I'd choose the Imperial Assault Troupe. 
... 
Yes, of course. You are the Flower Division's captain, after all. 
... 
... 
Sumire, you're important to me... and the Troupe is important to me, too. 
I really don't think I could ever choose between the two. 
Ensign... 
... 
Ah, E-Ensign... 
What is it? Is something wrong? 
...No, nothing at all. 
Well then, do pardon me. 
Hey, Sumire!

I... I... 
Wait just a damn minute!

Who are you people? 
I am Captain Ichiro Ogami of the Imperial Assault Troupe, Flower Division! 
And I'm Kanna Kirishima, also from the Flower Division! 
Ensign... and Kanna... 
Sumire. 
Sumire... 
Hoh, so you are Ogami, then. All this fuss, I presume you must know who I am, then? 
Surely you have not come here in order to embarrass me... 
...Tadayoshi Kanzaki, who has financed the troupe's activities for so many years? 
No. And the troupe is eternally grateful for the support you've given us. 
But this is a completely separate matter! 
I must object to Sumire being forced into a marriage she doesn't want! 
That's right, gramps! If you think things're gonna go just how you wanted, you're in for a rude awakening! 
Fu... Fwahahaha! Such bravado! I suppose I should expect as much, since you've come all this way. 
But Ogami, what would you say to this? 
You are aware that the troupe's financiers are pulling back their funding, are you not? 
...Yes. 
If you agree to leave peaceably right now, I will see to it that your funding is restored. 
However, if you take Sumire with you, you understand what will happen, yes? 
Grandfather! 
That's low, old man! 
Be silent, women! 
... 
... 
Now then, what will you do, Ogami? 
I understand. 
We're taking Sumire back with us. 
Ensign! 
I... can't make this decision myself. There's too much riding on it. 
B-Boss, what the hell're you saying?! 
... 
You said it yourself, didn't you, Boss?! No matter how tough things might be, we gotta do this with our own strength! 
Sumire's an important part of the Flower Division! 
...Yes. You're absolutely right, Kanna. 
We're taking Sumire back with us! 
Right...

Yeah. You're safe now. 
Captain... 
... 
Hm? Is that you, Kanna? 
Oh, Boss? 
I was just readin' the lines for the Holy Mother... This is tough. 
I've played almost nothing but masculine roles like King Lear or Son Goku up till now. 
Do you really think I have what it takes to play a feminine role like this? 
Of course you do! You'd be great, Kanna. 
Huh? R-really? 
Yeah, really. Don't think about it so hard. 
Just throw yourself into it like you always do, Kanna. 
Captain... 
Thanks, Boss. I'm feelin' a bit more confident now. 
It's true, there's some performances only I can do in the Flower Division. 
I just gotta do things my own way. Maybe a boyish heroine wouldn't be so bad. 
Heheh, now I'm lookin' forward to how this play turns out, too. 
Well, who knows? Nobody knows how things will turn out. 
But no matter what role you wind up with, so long as you give it your all, I know it'll turn out great. 
Captain... 
True, that might be tough. 
You think so too, huh, Boss? 
This is way too big of a role for me, huh... 
Sorry, Kanna. As the person picking the lead, there's nothing I can tell you. 
Ah... You're right.

It's been a long time, so let me introduce you again! 
This is my papa and mama! 
I'm Robert, Iris's father. Thank you for always looking after her. 
You may call me Marguerite. I'm Iris's mother. 
Iris has told us so much about you in her letters. 
Eheheh! Mama's really pretty, isn't she? 
You have a beautiful mother. 
Right? Right? 
When I grow up, I'm gonna be pretty just like her! 
She looks a lot like you, I was surprised. 
You're her spitting image, Iris. 
Uh-huh! I'm her child, after all! 
When I grow up, I'm gonna be pretty just like her! 
Your mother's beautiful, but so are you, Iris. 
Huh? Really? 
Yaaay! Mon Frère said I'm beautiful! 
... 
Ah! Mon Frère, you're blushiiiing! 
I'm gonna be just as pretty when I grow up, so just wait, OK?

Yes, sir. No matter what happens, I will protect Iris. 
Come visit again whenever you like. 
That way you can see Iris grow up, little by little. 
Iris... 
(Mon frere?) 
Uhhh... Mm... 
Ah... Was I... asleep? 
Oh my. Sorry for waking you up, Iris. 
I heard Mon Frère's voice and woke up. 
Hahaha, like Sleeping Beauty awoken by the prince's kiss. 
Huh? What did you say? Did Mon Frère... kiss me? 
...Huh? 
Hm hm hm... Maybe when you're a little older, Iris. 
N-Not you too...

... 
Iris? What's wrong? 
... 
Iris... You're feeling lonely, aren't you? 
Why don't you say goodbye to them, just one more time? 
But... 
Iris... Go see them. 
Your Papa and Mama want to be with you. 
But... They have to stay behind while you head to battle. 
So that's why you need to tell them "I'm coming back." 
Really? Is it really OK? 
Yeah. Go to them. 
OK! Thank you, Mon Frère! 
I'm... starting to feel a little seasick. 
Huh? Are you OK, Mon Frère? 
Yeah, I'll be fine. It'll blow over eventually. 
So... Why don't you go talk to your parents until I feel better? 
Mon Frère... 
Thanks, Mon Frère. I'll be right back! 
Please, Mon Frère... Can I talk to my Papa and Mama one more time? 
...Yeah, sure. Go ahead. 
OK! Thank you, Mon Frère! 
Here it is, Mr. Howard's home. The first house I lived in when I came to Japan. 
Wow, so this is where you learned how to invent stuff, huh? 
Yup. Now let's head inside. 
We should ring the doorbell first, just in case. I think it's this button... 
OK, let's head inside! 
Wait, don't open that door! 
Huh? 
This door will explode if you don't ring the doorbell first. 
Really? Good thing I didn't open it, then. 
All right, I'm gonna ring the doorbell now. 
*cough* *cough* <br> Wh... What the... 
Ohh! You always gotta ring the doorbell before coming in! 
If ya don't, my Anti-Thief Trap will set a bomb off on ya! 
Pops... We DID ring the doorbell. 
Oh... For real? [Are you sure?] Oh, looks like I messed up the sensitivity...

J-Just what I'd expect from Kohran's teacher... 
Now come in, you two, hurry along inside. Don't be shy! 
You must be all tuckered out from your long trip. Grab whatever seat you like over there. 
Right. Pardon me. 
Allow me to reintroduce you, Chief. This here's my teacher, Percy Howard! 
Howdy, Ogami! I've heard allll about ya from Kohran's letters! 
Hello, I'm Ichiro Ogami. 
Incidentally, that's an interesting dialect you've got, there. 
Oh, ya think so? 
Ever since I came to Japan, I've only ever traveled between Kyoto and Osaka, so that's why I talk like this! 
Which wound up rubbing off on me, too. 
I-I see... 
I am the captain of the Imperial Assault Troupe's Flower Division. Pleased to meet you. 
No, no, Ogami, ya don't gotta be so stiff! Loosen up a little! 
A simple "pleased to meetcha" will do! Just relax, OK? Relax! 
That's right, Chief. Howard will be happier if you loosen up a bit. 
R-Really? All right, I'll try. 
Pleased to meetcha! 
Hahaha! He's a funny man[, isn't he?] You're a real funny guy, Ogami! 
Yeah, Chief here's a real riot! 
Ever since I came to Japan, I've only ever traveled between Kyoto and Osaka, so that's why I talk like this! 
Which wound up rubbing off on me, too. 
I-I see... 
... 
...O-Oh? Was that all you had to say? 
You're a lot more reserved than I expected. Japanese people really are a quiet bunch. 
Well everyone's quiet compared to you, Howard! 
You must be Ichiro Ogami. Orihime told me all about you in her letters. 
I'm her mother, Carino. Thank you so much for being there for her. 
No need to thank me. I only did what I could. 
Orihime truly hated Japanese men, though. 
How were you able to get her to open up to you? 
I think it was all trust. 
Trusting each other, and responding to each other's trust in turn... 
I think that's how we came to understand each other. 
Hmhm, you're as corny as ever, Ensign. 
I understand completely. It's because I trusted in Seiya that I was able to wait until this day. 
Ogami, please keep believing in Orihime. 
All right. 
I think it was all patience. 
At first, even I didn't think we'd be able to get along. 
But I knew the day would come where she'd open up, so I just waited until then. 
...That makes me sound like a bad person. 
Hmhm, that's not it, Orihime. I understand what he means. 
I too waited a long time, just for this day... The day I could see Seiya again. 
Orihime... You should be thankful that Ogami waited for you for so long. 
Mamma... 
I think it was all love. 
W-Wait a second, Ensign! What's this all of a sudden?! 
Now, Orihime, expressing one's love is a very important thing. 
I think it's fantastic that Ogami is able to profess his love so openly. 
Mamma... 
I... don't really know, either. 
Hmhm, you're an honest man, Ogami. 
I'm sure Orihime sensed that honesty too. 
You're the man she chose. There's not a doubt in my mind that you're a wonderful person. 
Orihime. You must always treasure Ogami's feelings for you. 
Yes, Mamma. I understand. 
Right... Ensign, could you come with me for a second? 
Yeah, let's go. 
...Thank you, Ensign. 
Come with you where, exactly? 
Whatever, it doesn't matter, just follow me! 
H-Hey, Orihime, you don't need to pull! 
... 
Come on, Ensign, quit loafing around and hurry up already. 
All right Papa, Mamma, we're going to be in the lounge upstairs. 
Understood. 
We'll stay right here, so take your time. 
All right, let's go, Ensign. 
Thank you for being so considerate, Ensign. 
I bet Papa and Mamma have all kinds of things they want to talk about. 
Jeez, you're so inconsiderate, Ensign. 
Didn't you get the hint that we should leave them alone? 
S-Sorry... I didn't notice. 
...Sheesh, some things never change with you. 
Anyway, I had no idea up till now... 
No idea that Papa and Mamma loved each other that much... 
Orihime... 
I'm so glad they were finally able to reunite. 
Yeah! It's great... It really is! 
And it's all because you helped Papa and I patch things up. 
Thank you so much, Ensign! 
I'm actually jealous of them. I've never seen such a loving couple before. 
They really are. But it's OK, I've already a found myself a partner. 
You have? Who is it? Tell me, Orihime. 
Heehee, whoever could it be? 
I hope... we end up like them. 
...Yeah. I'm sure we will. 
Orihime... 
All right, Ensign, until Papa and Mamma's conversation's dies down a bit... 
Let's just stay up here a while, just the two of us. 
Yeah, let's. 
But at this rate, I don't think they'll be stopping till sunset. 
Heeehee, oh, Ensign, that's perfectly all right. 
Huh? Why's that? 
Heehee... Because, that means we can be alone together for even longer.

... 
Reni, it's me. I just want to talk for a minute. Will you open up? 
... 
...I'm coming in. 
Sorry for barging in like this. I was just worried about what happened during your rehearsal. 
...

... 
Reni? 
Captain... 
...Reni? 
I... I... What am I fighting for? 
Huh? 
I... I don't know what I'm fighting for anymore. 
Captain... What is it that YOU'RE fighting for? 
Well, you see... 
I'm fighting to protect the capital. That's our duty as the Imperial Assault Troupe. 
For justice, of course. 
...Justice?

Reni, do not be deceived! You are a killing machine. Everyone else is your enemy! 
That's not true! Reni, you have to believe in others! 
Mon Frère, take this! 
What... is that?! 
Reni, you have to remember! Remember who you are! Remember who WE are! 
The time we first met... The days we spent together... Have you completely forgotten? 
Remember how Iris poured her heart into making this flower crown for you! 
Urgh... 
I didn't know how lost you felt, how anxious you felt, how lonely you felt...

But now... Now I can tell you exactly how I feel!
