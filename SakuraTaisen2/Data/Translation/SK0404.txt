Several days after the fire incident in Fukagawa... 
WHAAAT?! 
Th-Then that means…
The old man from the restaurant was…
Indeed. That “old man” was none other than I, Kazutoyo Yamaguchi, Minister of the Navy. 
M-Minister Yamaguchi! Forgive me for my insolence, I didn’t know that was you!
I-I'm sorry for calling you "old man." 
Please, no need for apologies. I was in disguise, after all.
Who would ever think an old drunkard at a ryotei would actually be Minister of the Navy? 
W-We apologize for troubling you! 
More importantly, the way the Imperial Assault Troupe fought was truly magnificent. 
The group known as the Black Demon Society has been threatening Tokyo with their demonic power.
Additionally, there's been disturbing reports of extremist activity by those in our military. 
I don't want to make any rash moves involving our men. 
However, I promise that the Imperial Assault Troupe will have the navy's full support. 
What's more, I'm a fan of your theater shows. I can't wait to see the troupe put on their next play. 
To ensure that, I'll also pass along some words to my peers in the financial world. 
Th-Then… Does that mean… 
Are we finally out of the poorhouse?
I wish you a long life so that you can see Sumire Kanzaki's performance every day. 
Yaaaay! I love you, mister!
Hahahaha!! I'm happy to hear that. Good luck, young ones! 
Y-Yes, sir!
That's quite a relief, Captain. 
Yeah, and it’s all thanks to the reckless behavior of Sakura and Kohran.
Yeowch... That was harsh, Chief. 
Oh, Ogami... You're so mean! 
Tee-hee-hee! 
Ahahahaha... 
Sorry, Ogami. I can only sell you one photo per month. 
I see. That's too bad. 
So sorry, Mr. Ogami, but each customer is only allowed to purchase one photo at a time.
Oh, really? That's too bad.
