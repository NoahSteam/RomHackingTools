Hahh… Hahh… <br> Where are we, anyway?
We are inside a shack…
But I am glad we came to an understanding before the end.
What are you saying… <br> Grgh!
Papa!!
I-I'm fine… <br> Don't worry about me, you have to get out of here!
It is no use. There is a bomb outside the shack…
A bomb?! Why would they be targeting civilians like us?
Papa… To them, I am no normal civilian.
I… I am a member of the Imperial Assault Troupe!
Wh-What?!
But… on my own, I can do nothing. I see that clearly now.
Orihime…
