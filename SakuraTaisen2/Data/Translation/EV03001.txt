So this mansion is my hunting ground today, is it? Looks like fun.
Let's get to work, shall we. This looks to be the best hunt I've had in ages!
All of you, track down our prey at once!
…Hold it.
We won't let you do as you please!
The Imperial Assault Troupe has arrived!!
Hmph! So you're the Assault Troupe…
I will not tolerate such behavior as you prance into my home!!
You can't just barge into people's houses and do what you want! Don't ya got any manners?!
Well, not that you have much room to talk, either.
Oh, good, this would've been so boring otherwise.
I'll give you a taste of true fear!
What was that, you insignificant nobody?!
In the name of Sumire Kanzaki, I won't let you set a single foot in here!
I can't stand you… You should be more concerned about yourselves than the others!
Now, let the hunt begin! Try not to bore me!
Shaddap!
The Imperial Assault Troupe has arrived!!
