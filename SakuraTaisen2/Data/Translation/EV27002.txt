Hahaha! Not bad!
That's enough for today, Imperial Assault Troupe!
Hey, you there! <br> You look like the guy in charge. How's about tellin' me your name?
Ichiro Ogami, Captain of the Imperial Assault Troupe's Flower Division!
Heh… Ichiro Ogami, huh? <br> I'll remember that.
Next time I see ya, I'll make sure to carve it into your tombstone. Gahahaha!
He got away…
Ugh, what a dirty fight that was! I need to go home and take a shower!
…Shall we pursue?
No, let him be. <br> We can't recklessly chase after the enemy.
…
He's right! I agree!
Ah!
Thank goodness… <br> The children are safe.
…Yeah.
Protecting the capital means protecting the happiness between a mother and her children.
…
Hm? Is something wrong, Iris?
No, it's nothing… <br> I'm gonna go home now.
What was that about? <br> Iris got sad so suddenly.
You're right… <br> I'm worried about her.
