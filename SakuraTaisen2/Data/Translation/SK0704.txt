Your Excellency, the time has finally come to enact our plan. 
A state ruled by the Imperial Army… 
We of the Taisho Restoration Army will gladly sacrifice ourselves for your ideals!
Well said, Amagasa. 
The future of the capital rests on our shoulders. 
We make our move November 9th! You will be in charge of seizing the Grand Imperial Theater. 
Yoneda is a traitor who belittles the existence of our legitimate army. You will deal with him.
And… you will capture Sakura Shinguji of the Flower Division. 
If she attempts to resist… Kill her. I don't care either way. 
Yessir! <br> Leave it to me, sir! 
Heheheh… <br> The hour approaches. 
The Taisho Restoration, the dawn of a new Japan, is finally at hand. 
OK, time to get started on my night watch. 
I'm still worried about Orihime, though… 
Yo, Ogami! 
That voice… 
Oh, Kayama. <br> What do you want? 
That's cold, Ogami. After I traveled all this way, too. I'm crushed! 
…Just come inside. 
Hmph, very well. Alley-OOP! 
Say, Ogami, you're looking as troubled as ever. 
Yeah… A lot's happened. 
Come now, Ogami, have you forgotten that old saying? "After rain comes fair weather." 
The more two people quarrel, the stronger their relationship will become in the end. 
Ahh, humans are truly complicated creatures. 
That's true, no matter how much they fight, Orihime and Ogata are still family. 
Thanks, Kayama. I appreciate the advice. 
Attaboy, Ogami. Well then, farewell! Alley-OOP! 
All right, I'll stop by Orihime's room while I'm doing my rounds. 
It's 9:30 right now… That gives me a half hour till 10. 
The door's shut tight. It's properly locked. 
OK, onto the next room. 
Nothing unusual out in the lobby. 
OK, continuing the night watch, then. 
The merchandise is neatly organized. Tsubomi's pretty tidy. 
All right, nothing out of the ordinary here. Continuing my night watch. 
Yo, Boss. Out on your rounds? 
What are you up to, Kanna? 
Heheh, I got a little hungry, so I'm having a quick meal. 
Oh yeah, I didn't see Orihime come down here at all this evenin’. 
I don't know what's up with her, but she shouldn't be skippin’ out on meals. 
That's true. 
It's understandable.
That's true. Skipping meals is bad for your health. 
Glad you agree, Boss. 
All right, if she still hasn't come out by tomorrow, I'll bring her somethin’ instead. 
It's understandable. Sometimes people lose their appetite when they're worried about something. 
Y-Ya think so? I eat like a pig when I get nervous. 
Well, everyone's different. 
All right, if she still hasn't come out by tomorrow, I'll bring her somethin’ instead. 
What's up, Boss? You're spacing out. 
Oh, s-sorry, I was just thinking… 
C'mon, you all right? Keep it together! 
You should head to bed yourself, Kanna. 
*yawn* <br> Yeah, you're right. Eatin’ so much has got me all sleepy anyway. 
All right, I'm headin' to my room. Night, Boss. 
Right, I should get back to my night watch. 
Seems like Kanna's back in her room. 
Nothing particularly unusual here. I'll check another room. 
Gotta check for fire hazards… Can't be too careful. 
All right, we're clear. Let's check another room. 
Let's check this door… 
All right, it's properly locked. No issues here. 
Kasumi and Yuri have long since left the theater.
Nothing out of the ordinary here. I'll go somewhere else. 
Zzzzzzz… Zzzzzzz… 
Sounds like the manager is sleeping. Hope he doesn't catch a cold, falling asleep in his chair…
Well, I suppose I don't need to check in there. 
Nobody's here. Nothing out of the ordinary, either. 
I should get back to patrolling. 
Nothing strange here. Same as it ever was. 
I'll go patrol elsewhere. 
The dressing room at night… You can still faintly make out the smell of makeup in the air. 
Nobody's here and nothing's unusual. I should go. 
(Huh? It's Sumire.) 
(Where's she headed to at this hour?) 
(It looked like she went towards the stage...) 
Hm? I think I can hear something over by the stage. 
Sumire? 
Ah?! 
E-Ensign! 
Were you practicing your dancing, Sumire? 
O-Of course not! A natural talent like me doesn't need practice! 
I was just chasing around a bug, that's all. 
A bug? Where? 
…Right. 
A bug? Where? Where did it go? 
Well, that's… 
Oh for heaven's sake, Ensign! Try to read the room! 
Yes, it's true. I was practicing my dancing. 
Huh. I thought as much. 
And now you're going to help me with said dance practice. 
I want you to move the spotlight and have it follow me as I dance. 
W-Wait, I'm still patrolling the theater… 
No excuses! Now get to it! 
…Right. Bugs do tend to appear more often in the fall. 
Sorry to bother you, then. I'll be going now. 
Ah, Ensign… Wait a moment. 
You see, I… I actually WAS practicing my dancing. 
I didn't want anyone to see me, so that's why I said what I did earlier. 
I don't want to lie to you, Ensign… 
Sumire… 
Thank you for being so considerate of me, Ensign. 
If it's all right with you, would you perhaps mind assisting me with my dance practice? 
All you have to do is move the spotlight and have it follow me as I dance. 
Hmm… I hope I can manage. 
I know you'll do just fine. Now then, let us dance. 
… 
U-Um… 
I'm sorry, Ensign. The truth is, I WAS practicing my dancing. 
I didn't want anyone to see me, so that's why I said what I did earlier. 
As it turns out, it doesn't sit well with me to lie… 
Sumire… 
You've already found out, so there's no use in hiding it anymore. 
And now you're going to help me with said dance practice. 
I want you to move the spotlight and have it follow me as I dance. 
Huh? I don't know how good I'll be at it… 
I know you'll do just fine. Now then, let us dance. 
Phew… How was that, Sumire? 
Splendid, Ensign. Bathed in that glimmering light, I could dance with ease. 
How would you feel about becoming my personal lighting technician, Ensign? 
Uhh… Well… I… 
Ohohohoho! Relax, Ensign, I'm only kidding. 
Now then, I must be going. Take care, Ensign. 
Lighting technician, huh? I wonder if that'd suit me better than being a ticket collector. 
…Now's not the time to be thinking about that. I have to get back to my rounds. 
Phew… How was that, Sumire? 
I think you have a knack for this. 
Perhaps it wouldn't be such a bad idea to become a lighting technician as well as a ticket puncher? 
A lighting technician, huh? Hmmm… 
Now then, I must be going. Take care, Ensign. 
Lighting technician, huh? I wonder if that'd suit me better than being a ticket collector. 
…Now's not the time to be thinking about that. I have to get back to my rounds. 
Sorry, Sumire… I wasn't very good at controlling the spotlight. 
Well, it was your first time. Don't worry about it too much. 
Now then, I must be going. Take care, Ensign. 
Hmmm, I wish I'd done a little better… 
Oh well. I should be getting back to my night watch. 
Sumire had me help her with her dance practice here just a moment ago. 
So typical of her, not letting anyone see her exerting any effort. 
Nobody here except maybe some rats. 
Nothing unusual here. Moving on. 
Sumire had me help her with her dance practice here just a moment ago. 
So typical of her, not letting anyone see her exerting any effort. 
This place is always deserted, both day and night. 
Nothing out of the ordinary here. Back to my night watch. 
Oh, Mon Frère! Reni was just teaching me about the stars! 
She knows all sorts of stuff about them!
…The position of the stars can help you keep your bearings in battle. 
Guess what, Mon Frère? She taught me about the large dipper in the stars.
Oh, you mean the Big Dipper? 
If you follow the handle of the dipper alllll the way down…
…there's a star you can find at the very end. Do you know what it's called? 
The North Star? 
The South Star? 
The North Star? 
The South Star? 
The Star of Happiness? 
The North Star, right? I learned that in the Navy. 
Wow, Mon Frère, you're so smart! 
Not bad, Captain. 
I'm pretty sure it was the South Star, right? 
…Wrong. There is no such thing as the "South Star." The correct answer is the "North Star." 
Mon Frère, if you don't know something, don't pretend that you do! 
Hmmm, maybe it's the Star of Happiness? Hahahaha! 
Hahahaha! You're so funny, Mon Frère! 
Wasn't that funny, Reni? 
Y… Yes. 
Bzzzt! Time's up! 
It's called the North Star. That one, over there! 
Alpha Ursae Minoris, or the North Star, is one of the bodies that make up Ursa Minor, the Little Bear.
The Big Dipper is a chain of seven stars contained within the Great Bear constellation, Ursa Major.
Heh… They’re like a family of bears!
Even though the night sky is so big, they're so close to each other. They must get along great. 
…Yeah, you're right. 
All right, I have to get back to my patrol. See you later, you two. 
OK! Good luck with your night watch! 
A family, huh? 
Even in the vast night sky, you can find families who are close to each other, just as Iris said… 
But some families don't get along, no matter how close to each other they are. 
Could Mr. Ogata and Orihime ever patch things up? 
Oh, Mon Frère! Reni and I were just making our own Jean-Paul constellation! 
Hahaha… Don't go to bed too late, OK? 
Okey-dokey! 
Right, now back to my night watch. 
Past 10 already, huh? I should call it here. 
OK, guess I'll go talk to Orihime now. 
Oh, Ogami. 
On your night watch, Chief? Thanks for your hard work. 
Kohran, Sakura? What's up? 
It's Orihime. She didn't come out of her room for dinner. 
We tried to check up on her, but she wouldn’t let us into her room.
I was on my way to maintain the Koubu, so I thought I'd give her a holler, too… 
…But no matter what we tried, she wouldn't budge. Got any ideas? 
I'll try talking to her. 
I'll try making her angry. 
I'll try talking to her, so you don't have to worry about anything. You can rest easy. 
Really? Thank you. 
You're so dependable, Ogami. 
Seems like it's gonna be a lot of trouble, though. Even for you, Chief. 
I'll try making her angry. That might put her in a more talkative mood. 
Huh?! But that's… 
Hold on, Sakura, that could actually work. 
This is Orihime we're talking about. If we make her mad, we could maybe get her to talk. 
I think that's a great plan, Chief. Good luck. 
Come on, Ogami, say something! 
Seriously, Chief. You need to have your head in the game, especially at a time like this. 
Well, see you two later. I gotta go work on the Koubu. 
Good luck with Orihime, Chief! 
I'll be going to my room, then. 
Good night, Ogami. Good luck with your night watch. 
Hmmm… Will Orihime really talk to me? 
At any rate, I guess I'll continue my night watch for now. 
Brr, it's cold… Winter's almost here. 
Gotta make sure the door's properly closed… OK, let's check another room. 
The chandelier's shining so brilliantly. 
It doesn't look like this light will go out till morning. That's the Imperial Theater for you. 
Day or night, this place never changes much. 
Everything seems normal here. OK, where to next? 
Nobody's here. The fireplace has been put out, too. 
All right, nothing unusual here. Let's check another room. 
Figures nobody'd be playing in here at this hour. 
I should get going. There's nothing unusual here anyway. 
I've still got some time left. 
I still haven't talked to Orihime, either… I should get back to my night watch. 
Kaede? Are you in there? 
I better check another room, I guess. 
Yes, who is it? 
Um, it's Ogami. 
Oh, Ogami? Good job with the night watch. 
There's nothing unusual to report in my room. 
If you want to talk, could you come back tomorrow? I'm writing my report right now. 
I see. Understood. 
Well then, good night, Kaede. 
Good night, Ogami. 
Kaede said she was writing her report, right? I shouldn't bother her. 
Brr, it's cold. As you’d expect, the nights have started to get chillier.
I don't see anything unusual here, so let's go somewhere else right away. Brr, cold… 
I'd love to take some time to flip through a book, but I'm on patrol right now… 
Perhaps I'll come back to read some other time. 
I wonder if Reni is in her room.
No answer… 
Her nameplate's just a piece of notebook paper, as usual. 
Let's check another room. 
I wonder if Sakura is in her room.
Yes, who is it? 
It's Ogami… 
Ogami? Thanks for going on your night watch. 
There's nothing unusual in my room, if you were wondering. 
I see. OK then, good night. 
All right. Good night, Ogami. 
She said she was going to bed. If there's anything I need from her, I'll just bring it up tomorrow.
What a cute nameplate, typical of Sakura. 
Let's check another room. 
I wonder if Kanna is in her room.
No answer. Did she go somewhere? 
Zzz… No, I couldn't eat another bite… 
Sounds like even Kanna's asleep. 
Kanna's… Well, I guess it's more of a nametag than a nameplate. 
OK, let's check another room. 
Maria? Are you there? 
(Maria's reading in there. I probably shouldn't call out to her.) 
Who is it? 
Um… It's Ogami. 
Captain? Did you need something? 
I'm here on my night watch. 
I'm here to hang out. 
I wanna talk about Orihime.
I'm here on my night watch. Noticed anything unusual? 
Good work, sir. Nothing particularly out of the ordinary here. 
I'm reading right now, but I'll be going to bed in a moment. 
Got it. All right then, good night, Maria. 
Good night, Captain. 
Right, back to the night watch, then. 
I'm here to hang out. Thought you might be feeling a little bored. 
Sir, isn't it time for your night watch? 
Besides, I'll be going to bed after I've finished reading a little more. 
O-OK… 
Oh well. Guess I'll continue on my night watch. 
Actually… I'm here to talk to you about Orihime. 
…I see. So you've noticed too, haven't you, Captain? 
Wait right there, I'm opening the door. 
Orihime has indeed been acting strangely since noon. She didn't even come down for dinner… 
Hmm… What do you think we should do? 
I think it'll be up to you to do something, sir. 
The Flower Division is at its best when the hearts of its members and its captain are as one. 
So long as Orihime keeps shutting herself off from you, the problem won't be solved. 
And the one who'll get her to open up is… you, sir. You're the only one who can. 
… 
It'll be all right, Captain. I know you can do it. Have a little faith. 
Right then, I'll take my leave now. I'm going to read some more in my room and then call it a night. 
Good night, Captain. Best of luck on your night watch. 
So it really is all up to me, huh? 
Orihime… I wonder if she'll even listen to me. 
Are you on your night watch, sir? If so, there's nothing unusual in my room. 
I'm reading right now, but I'll be going to bed in a moment. 
I-I see. All right, good night, Maria. 
Good night, Captain. 
Right, back to the night watch, then. 
It's Maria's nameplate. 
OK, onto the next room. 
I wonder if Iris is in her room.
No answer… 
So Iris's nameplate is shaped like Jean-Paul. 
Let's check another room. 
I wonder if Kohran is in her room.
No answer… 
A gear-shaped nameplate, huh? It's just Kohran's style. 
Let's check another room. 
I wonder if Sumire is in her room.
Doesn't look like Sumire's in. 
…Who is it? 
It's Ogami… 
I have no desire to speak with a peeping tom. 
(Oh boy, she really is mad.) 
(I'll just make her angrier if I persist, so I'll leave her be.) 
Yes, who is it? 
It's Ogami… 
Oh, Ensign, on your night watch, are you? Good work. 
There's nothing unusual in my room. 
I was just about to go to bed myself. Good night, Ensign. 
OK, good night. 
Right, time to get back to my night watch. 
Sumire said she's going to bed already. I should leave her alone. 
This is a pretty subtle design, considering it's Sumire. 
Let's check another room. 
Past 10 already, huh? I should call it here. 
OK, guess I'll go talk to Orihime now. 
Nobody's here, and everything seems normal. Better get going. 
Even when all the humans are asleep, the machines down here never stop working. 
Right, I should get back to work myself and patrol the theater. 
It feels like a hospital at nighttime here, I don't like it. 
Nothing out of the ordinary here. I should get going. 
Looks like no one's taking a bath right now. 
I'll go to a different room. I wonder where everyone else is. 
Smells nice here, like soap… Sumire was just taking a bath here earlier, right? 
I'm starting to feel kinda funny… I should get back to my patrol. 
Huh? Looks like someone's in the bathroom. 
These are… Sumire's clothes. 
So that means… Sumire's in the bath right now… 
I am drawn to the bath…
Go back outside. 
O-Oh no… My body is moving towards the bathroom on its own… 
Ahh, this feels so good. There's nothing better than a bath after a rehearsal. 
(Sumire...) 
(Hmm, I can't see very well through all this steam. Maybe if I get a little closer...) 
(C-Crap!) 
...! <br> Who goes there?! 
Make an excuse. 
Run away. 
Make an excuse. 
S-Sumire… I can explain. 
E-Ensign?! 
I was doing my rounds, so I thought I'd check the bathroom for anything unusual, and-- 
E-Enough of your excuses! Get out this instant!! 
Y-Yes, ma'am! 
… 
I'm sorry, Sumire. I walked in without thinking… 
“Sorry” isn't good enough! 
I can't believe you'd walk in on a lady in the middle of her bath! 
I know… I really am sorry. 
…And here I thought you were different from other men, that you were a true gentleman. 
What a shame. Now then, I have to go. 
Serves me right, I guess… Man, I screwed up. 
I don't feel great, but I guess I'll just go back to my patrol for now. 
(I gotta get out of here before she sees me!) 
Phew, I think I got away before she realized I was there. 
If I'd been just a moment slower, I might not have made it. That was too close… 
Ah… Uhm… I… 
E-Ensign?! 
H-Hey, Sumire… Fancy meeting you here. 
Wh-What are you saying?! 
Get out! Get out this instant! 
Y-Yes, ma'am! 
… 
I'm sorry, Sumire. I walked in without thinking… 
“Sorry” isn't good enough! 
I can't believe you'd walk in on a lady in the middle of her bath! 
I know… I really am sorry. 
…And here I thought you were different from other men, that you were a true gentleman. 
What a shame. Now then, I have to go. 
Serves me right, I guess… Man, I screwed up. 
I don't feel great, but I guess I'll just go back to my patrol for now. 
She must be relaxing in the bath after practicing so hard. 
I should go. I wouldn't want to bother her. 
OK, doesn't seem like Sumire noticed I'm here. 
I'm still on patrol, so I should go somewhere else. 
Phew, that was refreshing. 
I suppose I should be getting out. 
(Oh crap!! It looks like she's leaving the bathroom!) 
(I gotta get out of here before she sees me!) 
Phew, I think I got away before she realized I was there. 
If I'd been just a moment slower, I might not have made it. That was too close… 
Ah, Ensign. 
H-Hey, Sumire. Uh… Were you in the bath just now? 
Yes. I washed off all the sweat I worked up during rehearsal and I'm feeling refreshed. 
Perhaps you should take a bath too, Ensign? You seem to be working up quite the sweat yourself. 
No, I'm still on patrol, so I'll do it later. 
I see. Well then, I'll be taking my leave. 
Take care, Ensign. Good luck on your night watch. 
I should do as Sumire says and get back to my patrol in earnest. 
Looks like no one's taking a bath right now. 
I'll go to a different room. I wonder where everyone else is. 
Apparently the pool down here can heat up the water using underground boilers. 
Leave it to the Imperial Theater to have a pool you can use even during the winter. 
The training room… Nobody's here at the moment. 
Well, nothing unusual here. Onto the next stop. 
It's a total mess in here, as usual. 
Nothing out of the ordinary here, apart from the smell of roses. Right, onto the next room. 
G-Good evening. 
Oh my, Ensign Ogami. What did you need at this hour? 
Uh, I'm here on my night watch. 
Oh, good work. We were just about to start our debriefing. 
You should join us, Ichiro! 
We can talk all about beauty while we sip on this rose tea Kiku prepared for us. 
O-Ogami… If you don't mind… I'd like you to have some. 
It's so cold and lonely this time of year… You can stay here if you'd like, Ichiro. 
I'll be sure to steal a kiss from you by sunrise! 
Y-Yokihiko! You… You can't do that! 
That's right, Yokihiko! Ensign Ogami belongs to everyone! 
I… I'm in the middle of my rounds, so… I have to go. 
Ah, Ichiro! 
Sheesh… I was in trouble for a second, there. 
At any rate, better pull myself together and continue my night watch. 
Now then, let's begin the debriefing. 
It's fall already, don't you think we should come up with a new theme to match the season? 
Fall is a gloomy season, so we should display our beauty with a more somber mood. 
Um… I think… We should try something a bit different… 
All right then, we'll make this the topic of today's discussion. 
(Wh-What on earth are they even talking about...?) 
Oh, but fall means we definitely have to… 
B-But… I think… 
So basically, to sum things up… 
(They seem to be deep in conversation, so… I think I'll just go.) 
Kohran… You're always working so hard on maintaining the Koubu. 
Oh, Chief. Same to you with your night watch. 
Seriously, thanks for always taking the time to chat with me. 
I brought some manju today. Want some? 
Manju? Well, since you offered, why not? 
…Wow, delicious! These manju are great, Kohran! 
I bought 'em from Tsurukamedo. Glad to hear you like them. 
By the way, you really like the Koubu, huh? 
We humans have to eat food and take baths, right? 
It's the exact same with the Koubu. 
You keep them nice and clean, and once they're finished fighting, you give them a good meal. 
I'm just doing the obvious, that's all. 
Still, I'm sure the Koubu are very happy that you do so much for them. 
Heheh, well they ARE called Koubu, it's only natural they'd be Kou-verjoyed! 
Ahahahaha! 
Oh, a wise guy, eh? 
Ahahahaha! 
Ahahaha! You're hilarious, Kohran! 
Really? You thought that was funny? Heheh, I'm glad it hit! 
…Ahahaha! Th-That was really funny! 
Hmm, it took you a while to laugh at that one. 
Y-You're just imagining things. 
If you say so… I was hoping you'd laugh a bit more, though. 
Oh, a wise guy, eh? 
Aww, I've done it again! 
Ahahaha! That was a perfect straight-man response, Chief! 
Looks like you finally found your comedic footing! 
…N-No good, huh? I just came up with it on the spot, but I still thought it was kinda amusing… 
Hmm… That wasn't very funny. 
Hmm… Guess it wasn't inspired enough. 
Alrighty then, we had ourselves a nice break, time to get back to work. 
Thanks for the manju. I'll be getting back to my night watch now. 
Let's both give it all we've got, Chief! 
Sure thing. See you later, Kohran. 
Well… I ought to get going, too. 
Oh, hey Chief. Thanks for going on patrol for us. 
Don't overdo it, Kohran. You stay up too late and you'll catch a cold. 
Thanks, Chief. 
All right, I'm gonna get back to work. Good luck with your rounds! 
Looks like Kohran's still working. 
I should get back to my night watch, too. 
Past 10 already, huh? I should call it here. 
OK, guess I'll go talk to Orihime now. 
I wonder if Orihime will even listen to me. 
…Who is it? 
It's Ogami. There's something I wanted to talk to you about. 
That MAN asked you to come talk to me, didn't he? 
I don't have anything to say to you, Mr. Ensign! 
Orihime… 
(I can't back down, not now!) 
(I have to open this door and talk to her!) 
(Now's not the time to be looking at that.) 
(I can't leave Orihime alone like this.) 
Orihime… Please open the door. 
No. 
Orihime, please, listen to me! 
No means no! 
Orihime… If you won't listen to me, then please let me hear your side of the story. 
Could you tell me what you think about your father? 
How stubborn you are! This has nothing to do with you! 
Actually, it does! 
You're right, but…
Actually, it does! I can't leave one of my partners in the Flower Division alone like this! 
Partner this, partner that… It is all you ever say! 
I don't recall ever being partners with a Japanese man! 
You're right. I have nothing to do with your family, not directly. 
But I'm worried about you! Isn't that reason enough?! 
Mr. Ensign… 
…No matter what you say, I will not be opening this door. 
…Mr. Ensign? Are you still there?! 
I already told you, I'm not opening this door! 
Orihime, please! 
That's cowardly, Orhime!
Orihime, please! Open the door! 
Aghh, shut your mouth! I don't want to hear another word! 
Orihime! 
… 
That's cowardly, Orihime! If you truly believe what you think is right, then say it to my face! 
…I don't care what you say, I don't feel like talking to any Japanese men! 
Orihime! 
Aghh, shut your mouth! I don't want to hear another word! 
Orihime! 
… 
Hmph! You are giving me a silent treatment now? 
Ah, thank goodness! Finally some peace and quiet. 
Give up and leave. 
Oh well. It's late. I'll go back to my room for tonight. 
But Orihime, I want you to know one thing. 
I don't think it's right to hate your father like this forever. 
I just want to help you two patch things up, that's all. 
All right, I'll be going now. Good night, Orihime. 
… 
… 
…Are you still there, Mr. Ensign? 
Yeah. I'm not leaving here until you open this door. 
Fine then, you can wait out there till the morning. 
… 
Why don't you just give up already, Mr. Ensign? 
And why don't you just give up and open the door already? 
Hmph! 
… 
No matter how long you stick around, Mr. Ensign, I'm not opening this door. 
The hour is late, just go to bed already. You're being a nuisance. 
Oh well. You're right, it's late. I'll go back to my room for tonight. 
But Orihime, I want you to know one thing. 
I don't think it's right to hate your father like this forever. 
I just want to help you two patch things up, that's all. 
All right, I'll be going now. Good night, Orihime. 
… 
… 
Mamma mia… You really are stubborn, you know that? 
…Come on in. 
Thanks, Orhine. 
All right, what did you want to talk with me about, anyway? 
Ask about Carino. 
Ask about Ogata. 
If you don't mind, could you tell me more about Carino? 
I don't know what that man told you, Mr. Ensign… 
But it's his fault that Mamma became so sad… 
Mamma… She tried so hard not to cry in front of me… 
But she was always in tears whenever she was alone…
All because of him… All because he wasn't faithful… 
There's no way I could ever forgive him! 
Never will I forgive him for making Mamma so sad… Never! 
Orihime, you called him "unfaithful" just now… 
But it seemed to me like Mr. Ogata truly loved Carino. 
That man is tricking you, Mr. Ensign! 
He may claim that he loved my mamma… but, it's an obvious lie!!
You were separated from your father when you were just a child, right, Orhime? 
So how did you recognize that Mr. Ogata was your father? 
…Before I came to Japan, I asked my mamma to give me a photograph of the man. 
I was thinking that if I ever saw him, I'd make him apologize.
There, is that good enough for you? Now go back to your room, Mr. Ensign! 
Orihime, can't you make amends with Mr. Ogata?
Of course not! He's the man who abandoned Mamma and I! 
Now please leave, Mr. Ensign! 
… 
Orihime… 
It's just like Kayama said, those two will never make up unless they talk to each other.
Is there really nothing I can do? 
I have no right to call myself her father. 
I… I won't be fooled by him! Never! 
… 
If only there was a way I could get them to talk face to face… 
I know! I'll take Orihime to see Mr. Ogata tomorrow, by force if I have to! 
That's all I CAN do. All right, I'll just have to try! 
Sorry Ogami, but customers are only allowed to purchase one of each bromide. 
I see. That's too bad. 
So sorry, Mr. Ogami, but customers are only allowed to purchase one of each bromide.
Oh, really? That's too bad.
