Thank you for allowing me to accompany you, Captain.
If you don't mind, I'd like to know why did you choose me.
Well…
I need you.
You're our greatest asset
It's because I need you, Maria. Isn't that obvious?
I want you to be by my side in our battles.
Captain…
Thank you very much. I will give it my all to meet your expectation.
OK, Maria. I'm counting on you.
Because you're our greatest asset, of course.
When it comes to battling together, I can rely on you more that anyone else.
Thank you very much. I'll do my best to meet your expectations.
OK, Maria. I'm counting on you.
I'm sorry, I blurted a weird matter out of my mind.
Even if you have no reasons, being chosen is already enough for me.
…Thank you.
Well then, Maria. Let's go! 
Roger!
