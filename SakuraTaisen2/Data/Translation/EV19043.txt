Thank you for allowing me to accompany you, Captain.
If you don't mind, I'd like to know why you chose me.
Well…
I need you.
You're our greatest asset.
It's because I need you, Maria. Isn't that obvious?
I want you to be by my side in our battles.
Captain…
Thank you very much. I’ll do my best to live up to those feelings.
OK, Maria. I'm counting on you.
Because you're our greatest asset, of course.
When it comes to battling together, I can rely on you more that anyone else.
Thank you very much. I'll do my best to meet your expectations.
OK, Maria. I'm counting on you.
Ah… Sorry for asking such an odd question.
Even if you don't have a reason, being chosen is already enough for me.
…Thank you.
Well then, Maria. Let's go! 
Roger!
