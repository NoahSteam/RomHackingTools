Your time to shine has come, Ensign.
Please, do your best for me…
You mustn't overexert yourself…
Now, here I come!
Watch me, Ensign!
What would you do without me?
I-If this keeps up…
Ensign… I'm so glad…
You're the only one I know who can protect me, Ensign.
M-My body moved on its own, that's all.
How could I be so careless…?
I can't bear to… leave you behind, Ensign!
Splendid, Ensign.
My, Ensign, so gallant!
That was nothing.
Did you see that, Ensign?

Let's end this quickly so we can go home.
I think we might be in trouble!
This is fun!
Eyes on me, please!
You just can't rely on Japanese men!
I'd kill for a shower!
To think I'd be shielded by a Japanese man…
Don't overdo it, Mr. Ensign…
Sheesh, you're hopeless!
I can't take it anymore!
I have to retreat. I can't keep going… Captain…
Not bad!
That was super cool, Mr. Ensign!

Interesting…
You OK, Suiko?
You'll burn brilliantly…
Prepare yourselves.
Ahahahahaha!
I'll burn you to a crisp!
You… Pieces of trash…
I'll show you what I've got.
I'll be gentle.
Hm hm hm… I won't lose.
Not bad. Just as I expected, Assault Troupe.
Urgh… So strong…
Now it's my turn.
My calculations are flawless.
I-I won't let it end like this…
This, too, falls within my calculations.
Ngh… This was not part of my calculations…
I'll hunt you down!
I'll make this quick.
I'll squash you like a bug!
Don't think you've won…!
This isn't over yet!
I'll end this.
Here I come, Assault Troupe!
No, not yet!
You've improved…
Urgh… I'll have my revenge…
You shan't be forgiven…
Know thy sins…
Battle is always uncertain…
Love is dead…
Ngh… Not bad…
Don't touch me!
You haven't even begun to feel this city's grudge…
In the end… I'll be the last one standing!
At this rate, I'll… Ngh!!
Don't get cocky, you hypocrites!
