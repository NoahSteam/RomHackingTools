Good morning, Captain. 
Good morning. Our vacation ends tomorrow, doesn't it? 
We should all go to the beach today. 
All right, I'm gonna swim my ass off! 
Let's play together, Reni! 
Still, it was quite a shock to learn that Reni's a girl. 
Yeah, for real. Why didn't you say so sooner? 
…No reason. I didn't think it was necessary. 
Were you ever aware of this, Ensign? 
Of course I knew. 
I had a hunch. 
I had no idea. 
Yeah, of course I knew. 
Hmmm… <br> So you peeped on her in the bath, knowing she was a girl? 
Eegh?! <br> H-Hang on a second, Sakura! 
I don't want to hear it! 
Ahahaha! <br> She's mad at you. 
I had a hunch that Reni might be a girl. 
But I thought it might be rude to just ask her directly whether it was true or not. 
My, Ensign… That reserved judgment is quite fitting for a captain. 
Reni, as fellow girls, let's be friends! 
OK… 
I had no idea. I thought she was a boy this whole time. 
Really? And you still peeped on her? 
N-No! That's uncalled for, Kohran. 
Ahaha, kidding, I'm kidding! 
… 
Well, you sure went quite real quick. That's pretty suspicious… 
You must've had quite the shock yourself when the ensign went in the bath, didn't you, Reni? 
Not really… There's no significant difference between men and women. 
*sigh* <br> Aren't we philosophical today. 
The beach, huh? Yeah, let’s end things right and have a blast! 
All right, everyone, let's meet up in the lobby once we're all ready. 
Okey-dokey! 
Right, I should head back to my room and get ready, too. 
Let's see, now. <br> Swimsuit, check… 
Pardon me, Captain. <br> It's Maria. 
Oh, Maria? Come in. 
Please forgive the intrusion. 
We only have two days left of our vacation, sir. 
Don't you think we should call the theater and let them know how we're doing? 
Yeah, you have a point.
What a pain… 
Yeah, you have a point. <br> All right, let's give them a call.
Yes, please do. 
What a pain… <br> I just wanna go to the beach. 
I know how you feel, Captain, but it's important to keep in contact. 
Kaede and the others are probably wondering how things are going here. 
O-OK, let's give them a call, then. 
You want to go to the beach as soon as you can, don't you, Captain? 
Let's contact the theater first, then we can spend all the time we want at the beach.
You're right. <br> Let's give them a call. 
…Huh? <br> Captain, where's the Kinematron? 
The Kinematron? <br> It's right there, on the desk… 
It's not here! Huh… <br> Where on earth did it go? 
Let's try searching the room. I'll help you look. 
Right, I appreciate it. Crap, where could it have gone? 
That's strange… <br> We've searched the place from top to bottom but I don't see it anywhere. 
If the Kinematron's really gone missing, we're in trouble. 
Yes. We'll have lost our sole means of contacting the theater. 
What should we do, Captain? 
Let everyone know.
Look for it a bit longer.
Let everyone know.
Look for it a bit longer. 
Forget about it. 
We should let everyone know. We might have a problem on our hands. 
That’s… true… 
… 
…Maria? 
Let's look for the Kinematron a bit longer. <br> We might be on the verge of finding it. 
Yes, you're right. It's too soon to be causing a stir. 
Eh, forget about it. <br> I'm sure somebody's just borrowing it. 
Now is not the time for jokes, sir! 
The Kinematron is our primary means of communicating with the theater. 
We can't just "forget about it"! That's far too irresponsible! 
R-Right, sorry. 
Hmmm… <br> What could've happened to it? 
… 
Captain, perhaps we shouldn't tell the others about this. 
Everyone in the Flower Division has been looking forward to this beach trip. 
I don't want to worry everyone during their well-earned vacation. 
Maria… 
Telling them about this situation will only stress them out. 
Let's search for the Kinematron ourselves a while longer. 
Got it. We'll look for it, just the two of us. 
At any rate, I'm glad you're here to help. 
Hmhm, the feeling's mutual. 
Right then, let's search the inn. 
Oh, Ogami and Maria. 
You two came at just the right time! 
Oh, you've changed into your swimsuits already? 
Orihime insisted we try on our bathing suits right away… 
So… that we could compare them. 
Well, Mr. Ensign, which one do you like best? 
O-Orihime! 
Oh yes, and I won’t accept an answer such as "I like them both equally." 
I like Sakura's swimsuit. 
I like Orihime's swimsuit. 
I like them both equally. 
I, uh… <br> I like Sakura's swimsuit. 
Ogami… 
Thank you, Ogami. <br> I'm happy to hear it! 
*sigh* <br> Figures that Mr. Ensign would have no sense of fashion. 
Well, I did not expect much from you, anyway. 
I, uh… <br> I like Orihime's swimsuit. 
Heheh! I didn't think you had an eye for fashion, Mr. Ensign! 
… 
Sakura… 
No, it's fine. Orihime's bathing suit IS quite nice, after all. 
I, uh… <br> I like them both equally. 
I just told you that I wouldn't accept that answer! 
Wh-What can I say? <br> They're both nice… 
Mamma mia, this is why you can't trust Japanese men, they're so wishy-washy! 
Ah… 
Hmmm… <br> I don't think I can answer that question. 
*sigh* <br> It just goes to show, Japanese men are so indecisive. 
Ah… 
(Captain, let's try asking them about the Kinematron, indirectly.) 
Right… 
Seen the Kinematron around? 
Have you been in my room? 
Nice weather we're having.
Hey, you two haven't seen the Kinematron anywhere, have you? 
S-Sir, what part of "indirectly" didn't you understand?! 
Oh… Right… 
…? 
Kinematron? You mean that communicator of yours? 
I haven't seen it. <br> What about you, Sakura? 
Sorry, I haven't seen it either. 
I see… 
Say, did either of you go into my room between last night and now? 
(Nicely done, Captain. <br> Good thinking.) 
Why would I ever go into your room? 
I haven't been there either. 
I see. Hmm… 
Uh, nice weather we're having. 
Yes, it's perfect swimming weather.
…Is that really all you wanted to talk to us about? 
That's a little TOO indirect, sir… 
R-Right, sorry. 
… 
We won't get any information if you keep quiet, sir. 
Y-You're right. I guess I was spacing out a little. 
What are you two muttering about? 
Oh, sorry. It's private. 
Anyway, we have to go now. You two enjoy yourselves. 
OK. See you at the beach. 
I look forward to seeing your swimsuit, Maria. 
Hmm, doesn't sound like either of them knew. 
I've been staying in the same room as them… 
But I haven't seen the Kinematron in there either. 
I see. All right, let's look elsewhere. 
Oh, Ogami and Maria. Did you need something else? 
Y-Yeah… 
… 
What's wrong? Your eyes are darting all over the place. 
No, it's nothing. 
Doesn't seem like it's here after all, Captain. 
Apparently not. <br> Let's check another room. 
Looking at everything in the room EXCEPT for the girls in swimsuits… <br> What a strange man you are. 
Hmhm, sorry, we didn't mean anything by it. 
OK, Captain, we should go. 
Doesn't look like it's here after all. 
Yeah. <br> Let's check elsewhere. 
Why do you two keep coming here? 
She's right, sir, there's nothing left to see here. 
You're right. Let's check somewhere else. 
Oh for the love of-- <br> What do you want?! 
Hmm… Where on earth could it be? 
If only we could find some sort of clue… 
Captain… 
And Maria, too! <br> What's wrong? 
N-Nothing, it's just… 
What are you two up to? 
We just took a bath together! Isn't that right, Reni? 
Yeah. 
Right, you're both girls, after all. 
Right, today would be your last chance to bathe in the hot springs, huh. 
Why don't you take a morning bath, Mon Frère? <br> It feels great! 
Shall we, Maria? 
Shall we, everyone? 
I'm busy right now. 
That sounds pretty nice, actually. Shall we, Maria? 
Wh-What are you saying? 
Have you already forgotten about your little incident yesterday? 
Oh, right, that happened. 
We have more important things to do right now, sir. 
Now's not the time for jokes. 
Y-Yeah. 
Let's go get ready for the beach, Reni. 
Roger. 
OK, bye-bye, Mon Frère! 
All right then. <br> Shall we, everyone? 
C-Captain, what are you saying? 
You wouldn't be saying that if Reni wasn't a girl, would you! You're such a pervert, Mon Frère! 
Let's go, Reni! We have to get ready for the beach! 
Roger. 
I'd love to, but I'm busy right now. 
Really? <br> It feels so good, though. 
Well then, Reni, let's get ready for the beach! 
Roger. 
OK, bye-bye, Mon Frère! 
Thank you, Iris, but the captain's a little busy, so he can't take a bath right now. 
Really? You must have a lot on your plate, Mon Frère. 
Well then, Reni, let's get ready for the beach! 
Roger. 
OK, bye-bye, Mon Frère! 
… 
Doesn't seem like either of them knew anything about the Kinematron. 
I don't see it anywhere in the changing room, either. 
Not a single clue to be found… Let's check another room. 
Seems like Iris and Reni have left. 
And I don't see the Kinematron anywhere. We should go. 
As expected, nobody's here. 
No matter how much we look, I don't think we'll find the Kinematron here. 
Doesn't seem like anything's changed since we last looked. 
Yeah. <br> Let's check another room. 
Oh, if it isn't Maria and the boss. 
Hey, Kanna. 
I'm waiting for the others. I wanna make sure we all head down to the beach together. 
You guys finished getting ready? 
Yeah, we're ready. 
No, not yet… 
Yeah, we're ready. 
Go on ahead if you want.
Yeah, we're ready. We can head to the beach whenever. 
Captain, we're still not finished with our important business! 
Oh, right, sorry. 
“Important business"? Whaddya mean? 
N-Nothing, Kanna, don't worry about it. 
No, not yet… 
C'mon, guys, hurry it up. 
Sorry, Kanna. We'll be ready in a little bit. 
No, not yet. We'll still need some time to get ready. 
You can all go on ahead if you want. We'll meet up with you there. 
…Got it. <br> Man, you're sure takin’ your sweet time, though. 
Sorry, Kanna. We'll head straight down to the beach once we're done. 
We need a bit more time to get ready. Can you wait just a little longer? 
If we're taking too long, you can go on ahead, we don't mind. We'll meet up later. 
…Got it. <br> Man, you're sure takin’ your sweet time, though. 
Sorry, Kanna. We'll head straight down to the beach once we're done. 
All right, just come to the entrance once you're ready. 
If you're late, we can meet up at the beach, that's fine. 
Thank you, Kanna. 
See ya later. <br> Be quick about it, OK?
Everyone's really looking forward to this beach trip… 
Yeah. We have to find the Kinematron, for their sake. 
Yes. Let's do what we can. 
Kanna and the others are waiting just outside the entrance. 
Kanna's waiting just outside the entrance. 
Heyyy, Boss! You ready? 
Are you ready yet, Mon Frère? 
Sorry, not yet! <br> I need a bit more time. 
For crying out loud… <br> We'll leave you two behind if you don't hurry! 
We'll be waiting by the entrance, so come once you're ready! 
The Kinematron's nowhere to be found. 
Captain, why do you suppose it went missing? 
Maybe someone took it? 
Maybe I left it somewhere? 
Maybe someone took it? 
Maybe I left it somewhere? 
I can't say just yet. 
Maybe someone took it? 
That's definitely a possibility. 
But if any of us in the Flower Division had it, I'm sure they'd report that to you. 
Yeah, you're right. 
Maybe I left it somewhere and forgot about it?
Did you take it outside at all? 
No, it's been in my room the whole time. 
Then I don't think that's the case. 
Hmmm… I can't say just yet. 
I don't want to assume any wrongdoing at this point in time. 
Just as I'd expect from you, sir. I feel the same way. 
Hmmm… I have no idea. 
Indeed, we don't have any clues at all. 
At any rate, we can't say for sure without looking around some more. 
Yeah. <br> Let's check another room. 
No matter where we look, I'm not seeing the Kinematron anywhere. 
Let's check a different room, sir. 
Oh, Ogami and Maria. <br> What's the matter? 
I could ask you the same thing. Why are you still in your yukata? 
Everyone's going to the beach, but I have sensitive skin, so I'm staying here to keep watch. 
Seeing as this room is empty, I thought I'd take a nap here. 
And what about you two? <br> Why haven't you gotten ready for the beach? 
You see, uh… 
I forgot something in here.
Seen the Kinematron around? 
You see, uh… We're just strolling around the inn. 
My, you two must be good friends. I'm jealous. 
Could it be that you’re both planning on taking a bath together? 
S-Saki! Please don't tease us like that. 
Oh my, I'm sorry. <br> I didn’t mean to make fun.
No, I just forgot something in this room. 
Oh my, that's no good. <br> By all means, take a look around. 
Pardon us, Saki. <br> We'll just be a second. 
By the way, what was it that you forgot? Do you want me to help you find it? 
N-No, that's fine, we'll look for it ourselves. 
(Good thinking with that excuse, Captain.) 
(Yeah, not bad for something I just came up with on the spot.) 
What are you two whispering about? 
N-Nothing. OK, Maria, let's start looking. 
We've checked every nook and cranny, but it looks like it's not here. 
So it seems… 
You didn't find it? <br> That's too bad. 
By the way, Saki, have you seen the Kinematron anywhere? 
…Kinematron? 
Oh, you mean that transceiver of yours? 
I haven't seen it anywhere. Did something happen to it? 
No, it's nothing. 
Really? <br> Well, all right, I guess. 
(Hmm, I can't think of any reason Saki would run off with it.) 
Hmhmhm, why are you staring at me so intently, Ogami?
I feel kind of embarrassed with you looking at me like that. 
Oh, sorry, I was just deep in thought. 
…We should probably head to another room, Captain. 
You're right. <br> See you later, Saki. 
Come by again if you ever need anything. 
Doesn't look like the Kinematron is here. 
Indeed. <br> Let's check another room. 
Zzz… Zzz… 
Seems like Saki's asleep. 
She did say something about wanting to take a nap, didn't she? 
… 
(Saki looks pretty sexy, sleeping in a yukata like that…) 
What exactly are you looking at, Captain? 
N-No, I was just, uh, looking for the Kinematron. 
Really? Because it looked to me like you were just staring at Saki. 
Doesn't look like the Kinematron's in here after all. 
Indeed. Let's look elsewhere. 
Zzz… Zzz… 
…You really seem to like this room, sir.
N-No, it's not what you think… 
Then we should be going. We've been here plenty of times already. 
…Captain, please try taking this more seriously. 
S-Sorry. 
Oh, if it isn't Maria and the chief. 
Hey, Kohran. 
What are you doing out here? 
I was just picking up the leftovers from our fireworks last night. 
I cleaned up a bit last night, but I couldn't get it all, since it was dark out. 
Really? <br> That's nice of you, Kohran. 
By the way, you been making good use of the Kinematron, Chief? 
You should try getting in touch with the theater, seeing as you brought it all the way here. 
Y-Yeah. 
Actually… 
Y-Yeah. <br> I'll make sure to do that. 
Thanks a bunch, Chief. <br> With the Kinematron here with us, we've got nothing to worry about. 
Actually… <br> About the Kinematron… 
C-Captain?! 
Hm? What about it? <br> Did it break or something? 
N-No, it's nothing. Don't worry about it, Kohran. 
(Captain! I thought we agreed to keep it a secret from everyone!) 
(Oh… Sorry.) 
(Sorry, Kohran. You worked so hard to make the Kinematron…) 
…What's up? You two went quite real quick. 
It's nothing, Kohran. 
Well, I'm gonna stay out here for a bit longer and clean up after the fireworks some more. 
You two go get ready for our beach trip. 
Thank you, Kohran. <br> Let's go, sir. 
Yeah. Later, Kohran. 
Kohran worked hard to make the Kinematron. We have to find it, for her sake as well. 
Yeah… 
Oh, you're back? <br> Didja need something? 
N-No, not really. 
Hmm, sounds kinda fishy! You two've been lurking around for a while now. 
And when I try asking you about it, you seem kinda on edge. 
Y-You're just imagining things. 
All right, sir, let's get going. 
R-Right. Later, Kohran. 
All right. Well, later. 
Kohran's pretty sharp, isn't she? 
We should be careful not to cause her any undue worry. 
Huh? Kohran's gone. 
She's probably not too far off, cleaning up after the fireworks. 
We should get going. I don't think the Kinematron's here in the yard. 
Well, if it is here, I'm sure Kohran will find it while she's cleaning up. 
Oh, Maria and the ensign. 
Did you come here to cool yourselves off? 
Something like that… 
Our holiday is almost over. 
What about this trip left the biggest impression on you, Ensign? 
Our rowdy first night. 
The fireworks. 
The beach. 
Our rowdy first night.
The fireworks. 
Your swimsuit. 
Our rowdy first night.
The fireworks. 
The hike. 
Our rowdy first night.
The fireworks. 
Bathing in the hot spring. 
Hmm… Probably how rowdy we got on our first night. 
Yes, pillow fights aren't exactly high-brow entertainment, but they do get the blood pumping. 
Are you forgetting about the scene you caused by sneaking into the captain's room, Sumire? 
Oh, right. That did happen too, didn't it. 
Hmm… Probably setting fireworks off with everyone. 
Those fireworks certainly were beautiful. 
The senko hanabi, the rockets… They were equally beautiful. 
Hmm… Probably our trip to the beach together. 
Ohohohoho! <br> I knew you'd say that. 
Going to the beach with you also left the biggest impression on me. 
Hmm… Probably the hike on our second day here. 
I hear Orihime fell into the river. 
And then the captain fell in too, haha. 
Hahaha. I got completely soaked, but it makes for a nice memory. 
Hmm… Probably when I stayed at the inn to relax in the hot spring. 
Yes, but please refrain from diving while in the hot springs from now on. 
Good grief. I was quite surprised to hear about that myself, you know. 
I-I already said I was sorry. Besides, it's not like I did it on purpose… 
Yeah, definitely the part where your swimsuit came off. 
Ensign, please! <br> You're so crude. 
Sumire's swimsuit? <br> What's this about, Captain? 
N-Nothing, nothing at all. 
So much happened during this trip, it's hard to put it all into words. 
That's certainly true. 
At any rate, I'm glad we were able to have such a wonderful summer vacation. 
We only have two days left. Let's enjoy ourselves as much as we can at the beach today. 
Yeah, we will. 
Now then, if you'll excuse me. Take care. 
A wonderful summer vacation, huh? 
We have to find the Kinematron, for everyone's sake. 
That's right! Why didn't I think of that sooner? 
What's up, Maria? 
Wait here a moment, Captain. I'll be right back. 
H-Hey! Maria! 
…And she's gone. <br> What's she in a hurry for? 
… 
… …
… … …
…She sure is taking her time. 
Captain! <br> Sorry to keep you waiting! 
What was that all about, Maria? 
Captain, take a look at this. 
That's… That's a piece of the Kinematron! 
Where did you find this, Maria? 
I thought I'd ask the innkeepers about the Kinematron, just to be safe. 
Unfortunately, nobody here has seen it, but… 
While their children were taking a walk on the beach, they picked this up. 
Then that means… <br> Someone took the Kinematron out of the inn! 
What's more, there's a high likelihood that it's already been smashed to pieces. 
I was told exactly where the children found this. Let's have a look, Captain! 
OK, let's hurry! 
According to what the kids said, it should be somewhere around here. 
Yes. 
But why would there be pieces of it on the beach? 
Someone must've taken the Kinematron here and broken it. 
That's a reasonable assumption. But… 
Who would do that, and why? 
…!! <br> Captain, over there! <br> I see something shining! 
What?! Where?! 
In the shade over there. Let's take a look. 
There's no mistaking it… This is my Kinematron! 
It's just as I thought. Someone took the Kinematron, brought it here, and smashed it. 
But why would anyone do that? 
Could it be a burglar? 
Could this be a prank? 
Was someone using it? 
Could it be a burglar? 
To block communications?
Was someone using it? 
Could it be a burglar, looking for something expensive? 
If that were the case, wouldn't they have taken something that looked more expensive? 
It doesn't seem like anyone else's valuables were stolen. 
You're right. <br> It'd definitely be weird for a burglar to only steal this. 
In which case, there has to be a different reason. 
Yes, perhaps. 
Could it be someone playing a prank on us? 
Hmmm… <br> This seems a bit too extreme to be a prank. 
You're right. <br> In which case… 
Could it be that someone wanted to use it? 
Yes, it's certainly plausible that someone intended to use it. 
But if all they wanted to do was call someone, then there'd be no need to break it afterward. 
Yeah, that's definitely true. 
Could it be… Whoever did this was trying to block our communications? 
Yes, I was thinking exactly the same thing. 
Hmmm… I have no idea. 
Indeed, all we can do is speculate. However… 
This is just a hunch, but… 
I believe the culprit doesn't want us making any transmissions. 
We brought the Kinematron with us to contact HQ in case of emergencies… 
You don't think they’re trying to prevent that, do you? 
I'm not sure yet, but it's certainly possible. 
In which case, we have to proceed with extreme caution. 
First we need to find some kind of clue relating to the culprit. 
OK, let's investigate the area. 
Roger that. 
Captain, it appears there's a cave over there. Shall we investigate it? 
All right, let's have a look. 
It seems to be a natural formation. It's pretty dark inside. 
I know, I’ll use this lighter to illuminate our path.
Captain, ignite the end of this stick and throw it into the cave.
O-OK… Like this? 
It seems to still be burning. Let's go in. 
What was that for, Maria? 
If the fire's still burning, that means the air inside is safe to breathe. 
I see. You always know just what to do, Maria.
Hmhm, my past experience came in handy. 
Right then, let's move on, sir. 
This cave just keeps on going… 
The ground is quite slippery and wet, too. 
It could be that the ocean water reaches this point in the cave when the tide rises. 
I don't really know how to swim, so… I'm a little nervous. 
I see… <br> Well, we'll be fine, so long as we're careful. 
At any rate, we should watch our step. 
We could get hurt pretty badly if we fell in here. 
Right. 
Seems like this is where the cave ends. 
Captain, come look at this! 
Is this… a wireless transceiver?! 
Who's making calls in a place like this? 
…! 
The transceiver! 
Seems like a transmission's coming in, but from who?! 
What should we do, Captain? 
Answer it. 
Ignore it. 
All right, let's try answering it! 
It could lead to a clue. 
Right, let's try it. 
No, let's not. 
We don't know who’s on the other end, we can't risk exposing ourselves. 
But this is the perfect opportunity to find out who the culprit is. 
Let's do it, Captain. I think it's worth the risk. 
…OK. Let's answer it. 
Let's do it, Captain. This is the perfect opportunity to find out who the culprit is. 
…OK. Let's answer it. 
If there's a transceiver here, it’s possible the culprit could show up at any time.
You keep watch, Captain. I'll answer the transmission. 
OK, got it. <br> It's all yours, Maria. 
…Yes. 
Suiko, is that you? <br> It's me, Kongou. 
(Kongou?! As in the Black Demons' Kongou?!) 
How's the plan coming along? Did you manage to destroy their communication device?
Yeah… 
Heheh, really? <br> Then the Assault Troupe's a bunch of sitting ducks! 
You really are one hell of a woman. 
(A woman? The owner of this transceiver is a woman?) 
By the way, why's your voice sound all weird? 
…I have a cold. 
Gotcha. Heheh, so even YOU catch colds, huh? 
…That's none of your business. 
Gahahaha! Right, I'll start heading over there with reinforcements, like we planned. 
Speaking of which, should I approach from the sea or the mountains? 
(What should I tell him, Captain?) 
(Hmm… Let's see…) 
From the sea. 
From the mountains. 
(Tell him to come from the sea. We'll cut him off at the beach.) 
Right, send in your reinforcements by sea. 
From the sea, huh? Gotcha. 
Well, you may not even need the extra muscle since they're unarmed, but better safe than sorry.
(Tell him to come from the mountains. We'll cut him off at the base.) 
Right, send in your reinforcements through the mountains. 
From the mountains, huh? Gotcha. 
Well, you may not even need the extra muscle since they're unarmed, but better safe than sorry. 
… 
All right, wait for me, Suiko! 
…We've got quite the situation on our hands, Captain. 
Yeah. I can't believe the Society’s plans have gotten this far without us noticing. 
They intended on picking us off unarmed, with no way of contacting the theater. 
We should get in touch with HQ as soon as we can, sir, and have them bring the Koubu to us.
Yeah. Thankfully, we can just use this transceiver. 
Hello, you've reached the Imperial Assault Troupe's Ginza Headquarters. 
Kaede? This is Ogami! 
We have an emergency! We've received word that the Black Demon Society is on their way! 
What did you say?!
Someone destroyed the Kinematron so that we couldn't get in touch with you. 
What a mess… <br> We'll be right there with the Soaring Whale! 
OK, please hurry! 
There, that should do it. OK, Maria, let's hurry and get back to the others! 
Yes, sir! 
Ah?! Captain! <br> Look, behind you! 
D-Damn! The tide must've come in at some point! The exit's completely flooded! 
The Black Demons will be here at any minute, but now we can't get out. 
… 
(That's right, Maria said she doesn't know how to swim…) 
Captain, you go on ahead and escape. 
Huh?! What are you saying, Maria?! 
You don't want me to leave you here, do you? 
I don't want to hold you back, sir. 
As someone who abandoned her country and lost her family… 
…You and the Flower Division are priceless to me. 
Maria… 
The others need you, sir. 
You have to get out of here, quickly! I don't want to lose them as well! 
Maria… You're a part of the Flower Division, too. 
There's nothing to be afraid of. Just hold my hand and I'll get us both out of here. 
But, sir… 
Cheer her up gently. 
Forcefully encourage her. 
It's all right, Maria. <br> I'll never let you go. 
Please… <br> You have to believe me. 
Captain… 
Don't be absurd, Maria! There's no way I'm leaving you behind in a place like this! 
Come with me! We’re getting out of this cave together!
Captain… 
Maria… You'll come with me, won't you? 
…All right. <br> I'll go with you, sir. 
… 
… 
Captain… <br> Will you… protect me? 
Maria… 
Of course I will. I'd be unfit to be captain if I couldn't. 
All right… 
Now, Maria, take my hand. 
I promise I won't let go. 
Please… Believe me. 
OK… 
All right then, here we go! 
… 
(C'mon, Maria… <br> You've got this!) 
… 
(Just 10 meters left…) 
… 
(5 meters left…) 
… 
(We're almost there, Maria!) 
… 
(…!! <br> She's gone limp!!) 
… 
Thank God, she's still breathing! 
Maria… Maria!! 
Maria, stay with me! 
… 
At any rate, let's get you on the shore! 
… 
Maria… 
Hold her hand. 
Pray. 
Hold her hand. 
Pray. 
Perform mouth-to-mouth.
I promised you, Maria. I won't let go of your hand. 
Mmm… 
Ah! Her hand's gripping mine back! 
…Ah! 
Maria, are you all right? 
I never let your hand go, just as I promised. 
Captain… 
…No choice but to employ mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. 
M-Maria… 
Mmm… 
…Ah! 
Maria, a-are you awake? 
C-Captain…? 
You look… disappointed, somehow. 
O-Of course not! <br> I'm so glad you're OK. 
She seems to be breathing normally. There's nothing left to do but pray. 
(Maria, please, wake up!) 
Mmm… 
Ah! She's regained consciousness! 
…Ah! 
Maria, are you all right?! 
C-Captain… <br> Did you… save me? 
It's all right now, Maria! You did great. 
Captain… 
… 
Mmm… 
Ah! She's regained consciousness! 
…Ah! 
Maria, are you all right?! 
C-Captain… <br> Did you… save me? 
Yeah. You're safe now. 
Thank you, sir… <br> I mean it. 
I'm just glad you made it out of there safely. 
I can still feel the warmth and strength of your hand, Captain. 
You held onto me till the very end.
Of course. I promised I wouldn't let go, didn't I? 
Captain… 
…! 
That noise! <br> It's the Soaring Whale! 
Sorry to keep you waiting, Ogami! The Koubu are prepped for airdrop! 
Understood! 
Let's go get the others, Captain! 
Yeah. Black Demons, it's time for you to see what the Flower Division can do! 
Sorry Ogami, but customers are only allowed to purchase one of each bromide. 
I see. That's too bad. 
So sorry, Mr. Ogami, but customers are only allowed to purchase one of each bromide.
Oh, really? That's too bad.
