Transmission from inside Musashi, incoming… 
… 
“Engaged Kongou at the entrance. Hostile eliminated, proceeding to Musashi core." 
Ooh! All right!! 
“Additionally, since comms will be impossible past this point, this will be our final transmission…" 
…Over. 
So we won't be hearing from them anymore…? 
You don't have to worry about Ichiro and the others! They're definitely coming home! 
He's right, Tsubaki. We can't be getting all gloomy now! 
I'm certain that… Ogami will be coming back. 
C'mon, Tsubaki! Smile, smile! 
Y… Yeah. You’re right.
This battle is sure to be a fierce one…
Yes… 
Ogami… Believe in yourself. 
Believe in your will… Your strength…
And… Come back to us alive! 
Sorry Ogami, but customers are only allowed to purchase one of each bromide. 
I see. That's too bad.
