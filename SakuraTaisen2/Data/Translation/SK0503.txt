Yaaaay! <br> The beach! The beeeeach!! <br> C'mon, Mon Frère, hurry! 
Ohohoho… <br> The children seem lively. Now, Ensign, let's make our way to the shore.
All right, time to show you the swimming skills I picked up in the Navy! 
C'mon, Reni, hurry! <br> Let's go for a swim! 
…I'll pass. 
Why? The water feels great! C'mon, already! 
Now, Iris, if Reni doesn't want to, you shouldn't force it. 
Ensign, inflate this boat for me, will you? 
Ah, OK. <br> I'll be right there. 
Sheesh! Sumire's hogging Mon Frère to herself already! 
We'll do it together, then, Iris. You wanna help out too, Reni? 
…Roger. 
Ohohohoho! <br> Keep it up, Ensign! <br> This feels great! 
All right, let's crank up the speed! Here we go! 
Come on, Sumire, let me ride on the boat already! 
She's right, Sumire. How about switching places with Iris for a while? 
Seriously, this is why I can't stand children. 
Wait, Sumire, don't stand up on the boat! 
Oh, Ensign, you think I'd lose my balance over something as trivial as this? 
…Whoa! <br> Wh-Whoawhoawhoa! 
Ah! <br> Sumire's gonna fall! 
Help Sumire. 
Careful, Sumire! <br> Grab onto me! 
Whoooooooooa! 
E-Ensign! 
W-Wait, Sumire, don't cling onto me so hard! 
Ahhh, we're falling!! 
Whoooooooooa! 
Sumire, are you all right?! 
Huh? What's this? I-Is this what I think it is?! 
Ensign! That's… <br> That's my swimsuit!! 
Y-You're right! When did that fall off? 
Well, at least we managed to catch it, right? 
… 
H-Huh? Are you mad, Sumire? 
Give me back my swimsuit THIS INSTANT! 
Oogh… You didn't have to go this far… 
Hmph! Now stay there and think about what you did! 
Hahaha! You look like the ball of rice in a kid's meal. 
Now I just need to plant a flag and… All done! 
I-Iris… 
Heheh, OK, let's make you into an even bigger ball! 
Reni, help me with his feet! 
…Roger. 
Y-You too, Reni? <br> You guys are so mean… 
Zzz… 
Moooon Frère, wake uuuup! C'mon, get up already! Mon Frère!! 
Hm? Oh, must've dozed off at some point. 
Ah, I slept like a baby. *yaaawn*… 
Huh?! 
Ta-dahhh! 
R-Reni…? 
…Is this really that surprising? 
What do you think, Mon Frère? Isn't Reni cute? 
I'm shocked. 
She… looks cute. 
That's a nice swimsuit. 
I really am shocked. I never thought I'd see Reni in a swimsuit. 
Hm hm, you'll hardly attract any men in a swimsuit like that, though. 
A swimsuit like Sumire's isn't hydrodynamic. Results in too much wasted energy. 
… 
OK, that's enough, you two… But boy, what a surprise. I think it suits you, Reni. 
Doesn't it, though? You look super cute in it, Reni! 
… 
She… looks cute. 
Ahh, you say that about every girl, don't you, Ensign? 
So what? Reni IS cute! 
Mon Frère said you were cute, Reni! Isn't that great? 
…Cute? 
Uh-huh! He complimented you! 
I-I see… 
That's a nice swimsuit. 
Goodness, Ensign, it's rude to compliment the outfit and not the one wearing it. 
Yeah! Especially when she looks this cute, too! Isn't that right, Reni? 
I don't mind… A swimsuit is the most functional outfit for the beach, that's all. 
Goodness… So typical for the both of you. 
… 
Don't be so quiet, Mon Frère, say something! 
Oh, sorry. This was really sudden, that's all. 
Goodness… As boorish as ever, Ensign. 
C'mon, Reni, let's go swimming! 
Ah! Wait a minute! 
Hahaha! See, Reni? Doesn't that feel great? 
A-Aah… The water's cold. 
Hehehehe! Yaaay, yaaay! 
Goodness, children sure are energetic, aren't they? 
It would seem that even Reni is no match for Iris. 
You’re right. When you see them together like this, you realize Reni really is just a normal girl.
It was worth coming here just to see this side of her.
All right, here we go! <br> One, two…! 
YOOHOO! 
Boy, this feels great! <br> What a nice change of pace! 
Ahh, the air here's great! Not a whiff of smoke or steam! 
*pant* *huff* <br> Hey… you three… Wait uuup… 
Oh, whoops, almost forgot about Orihime! C'mon, hurry it up! 
*pant* *pant* <br> Mamma mia. 
Japanese mountains are so hard to climb! They're full of trees and skinny, zig-zagging paths! 
Man, you're pathetic. You could easily just run up a mountain like this. 
Do not compare me with a meathead such as you! 
Ooooh, you look just like Sumire, glaring at me like that. 
Keep making faces like that and you'll turn into a grump just like her! 
Achoo! 
What's wrong, Sumire? Why are you sneezing when it's this hot out? 
Huh… How peculiar. 
Well, looks like Orihime's regained her energy. 
Enough of the lazing around, let's go already! 
Big words for someone who was keeled over wheezin’ just a second ago. 
Eh, not that I mind. <br> Let's go, Boss. 
Hey, why don't we head down to that river over there? 
It looks real clean. Let's go dip our toes for a bit. 
Sounds good. Let's go. 
All right, full steam ahead! 
Urgh! You little-! 
Ahahaha! That's it, Boss! Keep it up! 
Hahaha, looking good, Chief! Like a real pro fisherman! 
You caught a living fish with your bare hands? How incredible! 
Are you one of those Hokkaido bears, Mr. Ensign? 
Hahaha, I think a bear would be better at this than me… Ah!! 
Hey, Orihime! That fish is coming your way! 
KYAAAAH! 
O-Orihime! <br> Are you all right? 
I am NOT all right! My clothes are totally soaked! I don't believe this! 
Help Orihime up. 
Laugh at her. 
Here, Orihime, take my hand. Can you get up? 
… 
C'mon, no need to hold back. 
All right then, I won't! HYAH!! 
Ahahaha! Guess even you can screw up sometimes, Orihime. 
…What did you say? 
Oooh, now I am angry! Let's see how funny you think THIS is!! HYAH!! 
Hey, Mr. Ensign! Quit your staring and lend a hand to me! 
(Huh, it's not every day that Orihime asks me for help.) 
Sure. Here, Orihime, grab my hand. 
You fell for it! HYAH!! 
Whoooooa!! 
Hmph! That's what you get for throwing fish at people! 
Ahahahaha! That looks awful refreshing, Boss! 
Yeah, guess this is what they mean when someone's "dripping with charm"! 
Now cool off your head and think about what you did, Mr. Ensign! 
Y-You're so cruel, Orihime… 
Ah… The water's great. 
Sitting in a hot spring like this washes all my weariness away. 
(…Hm?) 
Open air hot springs are supposed to make your skin really smooth! Come on, let's go in! 
Hmhm, no need to rush, Sakura, the hot spring's not going anywhere. 
That reminds me, this is apparently a mixed bathing hot spring. Do you think someone's already in? 
Huh?! Mixed bathing?! Why didn't you tell us sooner? 
(Eep! Nobody said anything about that!) 
(This is bad! I gotta find a place to hide!) 
Heehee, it's all right. It's only us staying at this inn. 
N-Now that you mention it, you're right. 
(They're gonna find me! I've got no choice but to dive!) 
Oh, good, looks like nobody else is here. 
(Phew… Seems like I didn't get caught.) 
Really? I get the feeling we're not alone… 
(…!) 
Are you sure you're not imagining things? Look, there's no one else here. 
Heh, you're right. Must be my imagination. 
Heehee, but if Ogami were in here, it'd cause quite the commotion. 
… 
(Urgh… This is starting to hurt.) 
Come up for air. 
(I have to tough it out…) 
Ah… I've never seen a hot spring with water this cloudy before. 
This is what's called a "nigori-yu" hot spring, Maria. 
The baths at the theater are nice, but nothing beats a real hot spring. 
You're right. My body and soul feel so relaxed. 
(Urk… Guh…) 
Come up for air. 
(Urk… This is getting harder and harder…) 
You're so stylish, Saki. I'm kind of jealous. 
Heehee, thank you, Sakura, but you're pretty attractive yourself. 
Oh, please. I'm still so young… 
*sigh* <br> I wish I could be like you and Maria. 
You're you, Sakura. You're wonderful just the way you are. 
Heehee. By the way, this spring is really hot, isn't it? And there's so much steam, too. 
(Urghhh… Y-Yep, it sure is hot… I'm at my limit!) 
Come up for air. 
(I-I can't last any longer! I have to come up for air!) 
(Phew! Now I can finally breathe.) 
(All right, it's so steamy you can't see a thing! I can hide again!) 
Still, it's nice to go on vacation with everyone like this. 
Heehee, you just like being with Ogami, don't you? 
Th-That's not… Quit saying weird things, Saki! 
Hmhm, you're beet red, Sakura. 
Th-The water's just hot, that's all. 
W-Well I think it's about time I got out! 
Heehee, you're so cute when you're embarrassed. 
Well, Maria, we should get going, too. 
You're right. Let's go. 
(Am… Am I in the clear?) 
*GAAAAASP* 
I managed to avoid getting caught. That was too close. 
Boy, that was one heck of a long bath, though… 
(I-I can't take it anymore!) 
Blehhh… 
Eeek! O-Ogami?! 
C-Captain?! What are you doing here?! 
Oh, it's just like I said. It's no big surprise men would be here, too. 
Well, we might as well bathe together, since we're all here. 
I-I'm done for… <br> My head is spinning… 
O-Ogami?! Ogami, wake up! 
Please keep it together, sir. 
Ungh… Where am I? 
Oh, Captain, you're awake. 
Ogami? Thank goodness. 
You really are a handful, Captain. 
Right, I collapsed in the bathing area, huh… 
Yes. I'm glad it wasn't anything too serious. 
Now, putting all that aside, sir… 
I know we're on vacation, but we can’t keep causing scenes like this. 
She's right! The innkeepers had to carry you out of there and everything, it was an ordeal. 
O-OK, I'm sorry. 
Heehee. Try as you might, you just couldn't leave, could you? 
Well, next time that happens, don't hesitate to pop out and say hi. 
S-Saki?! 
Oh, what's the matter? It's a mixed hot spring, why shouldn't we bathe together? 
A-Anyway, if this ever happens again, we're going home and leaving you behind! 
Y-Yes, ma'am! I'll be careful from now on! 
Oh, were you taking a bath in the hot springs too, Ogami? 
Y-Yeah, I just got out. 
Oh? But we were just there, weren't we? 
I-It was a really short bath, in and out. 
Captain, you should take advantage of the hot springs while we're here. Take your time. 
S-Sure, I'll do that. 
Hey, Ogami? Could you teach me how to put on a yukata later? 
My belt keeps coming loose, I don't know what to do. 
Huh?! You want ME to teach you? 
Yes, I want you to teach me each and every step in great detail. 
Great… detail? 
Ogami, your face is all red… 
Oh, that's cause I, uh, dove under the water earlier, yeah. 
…You dove in a hot spring? 
Ah, c-crap! What I mean is, uh, well… 
Captain! Care to explain exactly what you meant by that? 
(Sheesh… In the end, I was destined to be caught red handed, wasn't I?) 
…And so we all had a great time at the beach. 
Heehee! <br> It was fun, huh, Reni? 
Yeah… I guess. 
Haha, some things never change. Well, going to the beach in the first place is a big step for you, Reni. 
That's a big difference from a certain someone who was wheezin’ all the way up the mountain earlier. 
Hmph! Japanese mountains are just like Japanese men: unpleasant! 
Heeheehee, maybe you should've stayed at the hot springs with us. 
The water was great. My skin feels all smooth now. 
Hmhm, well, at any rate, we all got to blow off some steam. 
All right, let's cap it off with another pillow fight tonight! 
Wait, Kanna! Haven't we advanced beyond such crude pastimes? 
Yeah, last night you ripped the pillowcase and got yelled at, remember? 
All that being said, though, it's still a bit early to be going to bed. 
I know! Why don't we all set off some fireworks? 
Fireworks? That's a great idea, Sakura. 
Fire-works? I don't know what those are. 
Uhh… I wonder how you say "fireworks" in your country… 
Well, the best way to learn is to watch! Let's step out to the yard! 
So this is a firework. It's a bit plain, but kind of pretty. 
These are called "senko hanabi." They're Japanese fireworks dating back centuries. 
What a cute little light, huh, Mon Frère? 
Yeah. 
This isn't gonna cut it. 
Yeah. It's endearing how it keeps looking like it's going to go out, but never quite does. 
Uh-huh! <br> I wanna light one now! 
Hang on, guys! Senko hanabi are fine and all, but you can't just settle for that! 
Hmm… I don't think this is gonna cut it. Don't we have something a bit more flashy? 
Well said, Chief! I was waiting for someone to say that! 
Heheh, that's nothing, Iris. Senko hanabi are fine and all, but you can't just settle for that! 
That's why I've prepared my own specially-made fireworks, just for such an occasion! 
Wow, that looks impressive. Fire it off and show us! 
You got it, Chief! Once it goes off, I wanna hear your best chant! 
OK, is everyone ready? <br> Here we go!! 
Tamaya! 
Sakanaya! 
Tamaya! 
Sakanaya! 
What do you say again?
Taaamayaaa! 
That's the spirit, Chief! Good choice! 
OK, one more time! <br> All together, now! 
Taaamayaaa! 
Sakanaya! 
Hang on just a sec! "Sakanaya"? Like a fishmonger? 
Ensign, when someone sets off fireworks, it's tradition to shout either "tamaya" or "kagiya." 
Ahahaha! Sure, fishmonger, why not? Why sweat the small stuff? 
Yeah, I like "sakanaya" better. Let's go with that! 
Saaakanayaaa! 
Hahahaha! That's so weird! 
Oh brother. After all the trouble I went through with these fireworks, we're going with "fishmonger"… 
Um… What was I supposed to say, again? 
Wha-- C'mon, Chief, I thought you were ready! Your timing really sucks! 
Ensign, when someone sets off fireworks, it's tradition to shout either "tamaya" or "kagiya." 
For a chant like this, timing is everything. 
OK, one more time! <br> All together, now! 
Taaamayaaa! 
…You're killing the vibe, here, Chief. 
S-Sorry, I don't know the right timing. 
Don't think about it so hard. When the fireworks go off, just shout "tamaya." 
OK, one more time! All together, now! 
Taaamayaaa! 
Phew… <br> Today was a lot of fun. 
Y'know, taking a nighttime dip in the outdoor hot spring doesn't sound too bad right now. 
Yeah, I think I'll do just that. 
Reni, is that you? Bathing? 
Yeah… 
Guess you can't bathe with the others since you're a guy, huh? 
Well, we're both men here, so we can help each other wash up… Wait, huh? 
Say, Reni, your chest looks… kinda… feminine… 
… 
U-Uh… N-No way… 
Reni… You wouldn't happen to be… a girl, would you?! 
…Yes. 
Wh… WHAAAAAT?! 
*pant* *pant* <br> I can't believe Reni was a girl this whole time… 
…Jeez, I got so carried away, I ran all the way out here. 
Ah… ACHOO!! <br> M-Maybe I should head back to my room for now… 
Hm? Is someone there? <br> …No way! 
Whoa!! R-Reni?! Were you here this whole time?! 
Yeah… 
S-Sorry! I'm leaving!! Take all the time you want!! 
… 
Whew, that was quite the shock… 
…Jeez, I got so carried away, I ran all the way out here. 
Didn't seem like Reni was phased at all, though. 
It's easy to forget Reni's a girl when she's stoic like that all the time. 
Sorry Ogami, but customers are only allowed to purchase one of each bromide. 
I see. That's too bad. 
So sorry, Mr. Ogami, but customers are only allowed to purchase one of each bromide.
Oh, really? That's too bad.
