You did a great job, Iris. 
Yeah! It's all because I had Mon Frère with me! 
And because my new friend Reni was there, too! I wasn't lonely at all! 
Reni's great and all, but I still don't think Japanese men are all that dependable. 
Hahaha. Harsh as usual, Orihime. 
Reni, our next battles may get harder, but let's keep doing our best, together. 
...I don't mind. I came here to fight, after all. 
With battles of this caliber, we can't afford to be anything less than perfect. 
Huh? Looks like there's someone contacting us. 
I'll check it now. 
Hehe! Mon Frère! 
What is it, Iris? 
Don't forget your pro-mise with me! 
Promise...? 
Oh, Mon Frère! You promised to play with me, remember? 
O-Oh. Right. 
OK, when we get back, we're going on a date, first thing! Teehee, it's decided, then!
Together we'll go shopping, have lunch and then, and then... 
We'll aaaalways be together, no matter what! 
Er, boy... I made quite the promise, didn't I? 
O-Ogami, everyone! It's terrible!! 
What's wrong, Sakura?! Did something happen?!
I just got a transmission from Saki. 
Commander Yoneda... Someone just shot Commander Yoneda... 
Wh... What did you say?!
