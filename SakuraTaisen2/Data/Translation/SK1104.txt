How are you feeling, everyone? 
My head still hurts a little... 
The Tenbu are acting up. What's going on? 
... 
The problem lies with... the Tenbu themselves. 
What?! What are you talking about, Kohran?! 
Spirit Armors work using the Spirit Power of their pilots. 
Naturally, that means the stronger the pilot, the stronger the Spirit Armor's output. 
But the Tenbu don't just use their pilots' Spirit Power... 
They absorb what we call "city energy" from veins deep in the earth, and use it as power. 
I see... So that's why they're so much stronger than the Koubu. 
The bridge's spiritometer has been recording super high readings, the needle's ready to fly right off.
It seems like the Octagram of Demonic Calling unleashed a ton of city energy... 
And Musashi's sucking it all up into the air over Tokyo. 
And in turn, the Tenbu are absorbing all that energy. 
At this rate, the Tenbu will go completely haywire... Rendering themselves and their pilots kaput. 
No... We've come so far, and now we can't use the Tenbu anymore? 
Mon Frère... What should we do? 
Abandon the Tenbu. 
Fight, even if it's risky! 
Give up. 
I can't let anyone put themselves at any further risk. 
But then... How are we gonna fight? 
Uh, well... 
We have to keep fighting, even if it's risky! The Tenbu's all we've got! 
Captain! If we do that, we'll all die before the battle's even begun! 
But what other choice do we have?! 
...We have to give up. There's nothing else we can do. 
Captain! How could you say something like that?!
But... what else CAN we do? 
Let's think this through. There's got to be something we can do. 
You're right. We'll find a way through this, so long as we don't give up. 
Not to worry, everyone. We may not be able to ride the Tenbu anymore... 
But thankfully I also loaded the Koubu Kai into the hangar, just for such an occasion! 
Plus, I prepared Koubu units for Orihime and Reni as well!
Huh?! Kohran, are you serious?! 
Yep, I never lie. You'll see once we get to the hangar. 
Yaaay! C'mon, everybody, let's go see the Koubu! 
It's true! The Koubu... They're all there, ready to go! 
The city energy won't have any effect on the Koubu. 
We should be able to fight within Musashi with no problems! 
The Tenbu fought hard for us. 
We can’t let their effort go to waste, so let’s get in there and give it everything we got!
Yeah, let's do our best! 
Won't we be weaker, though? 
Yeah, let's do our best, everyone! We've still got the Koubu! 
That's right. If the pilots are tough, then the Koubu are more than capable. 
We're all much stronger than we used to be! We've got a fighting chance! 
But... Won't we be weaker? 
With the Tenbu, we were finally on equal footing with the enemy. Will the Koubu really cut it? 
We'll be fine! If the pilots are tough, then the Koubu are more than capable. 
We're all way stronger than we used to be! We've got a fighting chance! 
... 
Chief, I know you might be worried about the Koubu... 
But if the pilots are tough, then the Koubu are more than capable. 
We're all way stronger than we used to be! We've got a fighting chance! 
Hey, everyone! If we could have your attention, please! 
Well, how do we look? Now we have Flower Division uniforms, just like everyone else! 
Wow... Where did you get those? 
They had these made for us to go with our Koubu. 
They look great on you. 
Now you're truly one of us.
They look great on you two. 
...Thanks, Captain. 
Of course it does! There's not an outfit in the world that looks bad on me! 
With these uniforms, you two are now truly part of the Flower Division. 
...Yes.
Heehee, well said, Ensign! 
Heehee, I see you're speechless by how perfectly it fits, Ensign! 
We share the same Spirit Armor, the same uniform, and the same emotion. 
The Flower Division is now fully united, wouldn't you say, Captain? 
Yeah. Now the real battle begins. 
Right then, let's get back to the bridge. 
Commander Yoneda's likely waiting for us. 
Good, you're all here. 
In one hour from now, the Mikasa will finally reach its destination. 
We'll ram into Musashi and you'll destroy it from the inside. It'll be extremely difficult.
I don't want to sugarcoat anything, so I'll be blunt. 
The odds of your success are… extremely low. 
Does... Does that mean we might die? 
To put it simply, yes. 
But at the same time, I believe in you. 
I believe that you'll come back from this. 
The future of the capital rests on your shoulders. We're all counting on you. 
Heheh, I'm tremblin' with excitement now. 
We'll show 'em what we're made of! 
Good. Now then, you're dismissed. 
Everyone get some rest and prepare yourselves for the infiltration mission! 
Yes, sir! 
(1 hour until the infiltration mission... This battle is about to reach its climax.)
Ogami. 
Kaede? What is it? 
The final battle is almost at hand.
Like Commander Yoneda just said, this is likely to be a grueling fight. 
...Right. 
Everyone in the Flower Division is putting on a brave face right now... 
But I'm sure they must feel anxious, deep down. 
So please, Ogami, go talk to them. 
I know you'll be able to lift their spirits. 
Understood. 
What a pain... 
Understood. I'll be there to support them. 
Thank you, Ogami. I knew you'd say that. 
You mean I have to talk to everyone? What a pain... 
O-Ogami! What are you saying? 
Is this the kind of attitude the captain of the Flower Division should have?!
At a time like this, you have to be there for your comrades!
Y-Yes, ma'am... Sorry. 
Hm hm, what's the matter, Ogami? 
N-Nothing, just... I don't know if I can do it. 
Hm hm, you're the captain of the Flower Division, aren't you? Keep it together. 
Now please, go talk to them, Ogami. 
Right, understood. 
Sakura... 
Oh, Ogami. 
What's the matter? 
Sorry, you shouldn't have to see me like this... 
... 
You're worried about your father, aren't you? 
...Yes. I'd be lying if I said I wasn't worried. 
My father taught me how to use a sword. I know how strong he is. 
When we fought in Shinjuku and Akasaka... I think he might have felt some hesitation back then. 
But now... I'm certain he'll be coming at me with everything he's got. 
... 
I have to defeat him. He's the Demon King now. He's not my father. 
If I vanquish the Demon King... My father's soul will return. That's what I believe. 
Right. We'll win this! 
We don't have a choice. 
You're right. We'll win this! No, we HAVE to win this! 
For your sake as well! 
Ogami... 
It'll be difficult, but... We don't have a choice. 
We have to believe in justice! We can't lose to evil! 
...Right. 
Ogami... I feel... lost. I don't know if I can surpass him... 
Sakura... I know you can win! 
And we'll all return to the theater, together! 
Ogami... 
You can do it, Sakura! 
Yes, sir! 
All right, go back to your quarters and rest up before the mission. 
OK. Thank you. 
I'll see you later, Ogami. 
Sakura... This must be so hard for her, but she's really trying her best. 
Right, I should get going too. 
I'm so glad you're here, Ogami. 
It's because you're here, that I... 
Sakura... 
Ogami... 
... 
Sometimes... I wonder. 
I wonder what things would be like if I had never met you. 
But no matter how much I think about it, I never come up with an answer. 
I can't imagine a world without you, Ogami. 
Sakura... 
So please, Ogami, stay with me... 
Stay with me... forever... 
Sumire. What are you doing in a place like this? 
...Huh? 
O-Oh, Ensign. How long have you been standing there? 
I just got here. 
I-Is that so? My apologies. 
I was just looking at this perfume catalog, and I was so caught up, I didn't notice you. 
But... that's a clothing catalog. 
...Huh? O-Oh my... 
... 
Are you nervous? 
This isn't like you. 
Are you nervous, Sumire? 
... 
Am I not allowed to be? 
...Huh? 
This isn't like you, Sumire. 
... 
What exactly do you mean by that? 
...Huh? 
Must I always be brave? 
Do you find it odd that I'm feeling anxious? Is that what you're trying to say? 
Sumire... 
... 
... 
Even I get nervous sometimes. 
As a member of the Flower Division... As a woman... Even I feel nervous. 
... 
I'm sorry, Ensign. I didn't want you to see me like this. 
Sumire... 
I'll be all right now. I feel better having talked to you. 
Right then, I'll be taking my leave, Ensign. 
Sumire... 
Even I… Even I don't want to lose! 
I want to live and be with you, Ensign! 
Sumire... 
Ensign... 
I can... hear your heartbeat... 
We're about to go to battle. I'm nervous too, see? 
I don't want to die yet, either. I want to be with you. 
Ensign... 
Sumire, all of us are going to make it through this alive.
We're going to return, side by side. Together, always.  
Yes, Ensign... 
We'll return from this... together. 
Right then, I'll be taking my leave. 
Sure. Go to your quarters and get some rest. 
... 
Ensign... I found a lovely outfit in this catalog. 
Perhaps when we get back... You could join me for some shopping? 
Of course, that sounds great. 
But I thought you said this was a perfume catalog. 
Goodness, Ensign! You're such a tease. 
Anyway, good day, Ensign. 
Right, I ought to get going, too. 
Ciao, Ensign! 
Hi, Orihime. 
Even in the Mikasa you're just wandering around, as usual. 
Can I guess what it is you're doing? 
Sure, go ahead. 
You're trying to cheer everyone up. I'm right, aren't I? 
That's right, ya got me. 
I've gotten to know you pretty well, Ensign. 
Now it's your turn to guess. 
My turn? 
What do you think I was doing here? 
Getting a snack? 
Waiting for me? 
You have free time right now, so... I guess you were getting a snack? 
*sigh* <br> You're so clueless, Ensign. 
Even though I was waiting here this whole time to cheer you up... 
Huh? You waited for me? 
Could it be that you were waiting for me? 
Correct! Way to go, Ensign, you got it. 
Huh, really? 
Hmmm... Don't have a clue. 
Heehee, you're so clueless when it comes to these things, Ensign. 
I was waiting for you here so I could cheer you up. 
Huh? You waited for me? 
This battle's going to be the fiercest one we've ever fought. 
But I believe in you, that you'll lead us to victory. 
Orihime... 
The theater's become a very important place for me. 
Everyone in the Flower Division's important to me. 
Ensign... Let's make sure we all come back from this together. 
Yeah, of course. We're all coming back to the theater together. 
All right, Ensign, I'll be going now. 
Right. Get plenty of rest before the mission. 
You got it. Well, see you later! 
Ah, I forgot something very important! 
Something important? What is it? 
...Hm hm hm. 
…*kiss* 
O... Orihime... 
That was for good luck. 
So that you make it through this alive... 
So that we can be together forever... 
A good luck charm from me. 
Orihime... 
All right, Ensign, I'll be going now. 
Right. Thanks for the good luck charm. 
It's our little secret, you got that? 
Orihime... 
Right, I should get going too. 
Looks like Sumire and Orihime have both gone back to their quarters. 
Right, I should go somewhere else. 
Ah, Captain... 
Maria, is that you? Were you thinking about something? 
Yes... Sitting here has made me remember a few things. 
Like the countless times we've deployed for battle from this very room. 
... 
Captain, do you feel confident about this mission? 
Do you think... we can win? 
Yeah, of course we can! 
It might be hard... 
Yeah, of course we can! 
If we combine all our strength, there's no way we can lose! 
...Yes. I think so too. 
It might be hard. Kyogoku's unlike any enemy we've faced before. 
To be frank... It'll probably be an uphill battle. 
Yes, it's just as you say. 
But with the way we are now... I have no doubt that we can win. 
We don't know what the enemy's capable of, so I can't really say. 
Discreet, just as I expected from you, sir. 
But with the way we are now... I have no doubt that we can win. 
The Flower Division's always overcome any hardship we've faced. 
We never gave up… Even when all seemed lost, we overcame every obstacle. 
And it's all because we had our captain. 
It's thanks to you, sir, that we're able to fight beyond our full strength.
... 
So long as all of us give this battle everything we've got, we can win. 
So long as you're with us, Captain... We WILL win. 
Maria... 
Maria. For the Flower Division, victory doesn't come with just winning the battle. 
Only when every single one of us comes home alive can we truly call it a victory. 
Yes, I know that. We will come back alive, every one of us. 
Yeah, we will. 
I'll be going now. Excuse me, Captain. 
We'll meet here again before the mission starts. 
Right, I should get going too. 
OK... 
... 
Captain... I have a favor to ask of you. 
What is it, Maria? 
Please don't leave me... Don't die. 
Make sure we both come back from this alive. 
I don't want this locket to become another memento... 
Maria... 
I promise you, Maria. I won't die and leave you all alone. 
And I'm not going to let you die, either. 
When we go back, it'll be the two of us together, along with the rest of the Flower Division. 
Sir... Thank you. 
By the way, do you still not feel like showing me what's in your locket? 
I'm sorry, but no matter how much you ask... 
Aw, that's not fair, Maria. I asked nicely and everything! 
Hm hm hm, forgive me, sir. 
I'll be going now. Excuse me, Captain. 
We'll meet here again before the mission starts. 
Maria... 
Right, I should get going too. 
Looks like Maria went back to her quarters. 
I should head somewhere else, then. 
Oh, Boss! What's up? 
Just going around checking up on everyone. 
Kanna, were you exercising just now? 
Yeah. I just couldn't sit still. 
But... I'm having a hard time movin’ my body. 
Heheh, it's not like me to feel nervous, but I guess I am. 
Kanna... 
You should get some rest. 
Is there anything I can do? 
You should get some rest, Kanna. Our battle in Musashi is likely to be the hardest we've ever fought. 
...Yeah, you're right. 
Thanks, Boss. I feel a bit calmer now that I've talked with you. 
...I see. 
All right then, get plenty of rest, OK, Kanna? 
Is there anything I can do to help? 
I could talk with you, spar with you, whatever you need. 
Hahahaha! A sparring match sounds good right about now, but I'll have to pass. 
I'd feel bad beatin' you to a pulp right before the final battle.
Hahaha, you've got a point. 
Thanks, Boss. I feel a bit calmer now that I've talked with you. 
...I see. 
All right then. Get plenty of rest, OK, Kanna? 
Haha, my bad. Didn't mean to make you worry. 
I'll be fine. I've always been able to pull it together when it counts. 
When the final battle comes, I'll show you what these fists of mine can really do. 
I see. I'm looking forward to it, Kanna. 
Boss... Thanks. 
With you here, I feel confident in myself. 
With you here, I feel confident that I can't lose, no matter who I'm up against. 
Kanna... 
Get some rest before the mission, OK? 
Yeah. See ya, Boss. 
... 
Boss! 
Kanna?! 
Sorry if that was kinda sudden, Boss... 
But I just felt like doing this with you. 
... 
I've... never been good at expressing myself with words. 
I want to lend you spiritual strength... The strength of an Unaigami. 
Kanna... Thanks. 
Boss... 
Right... I'm gonna rest for a bit. 
Yeah... 
... 
Let's make it back alive, Boss. Let's make it back together! 
Yeah. When it's time to go home, we're going back together. 
I swear I'll protect you, Kanna. 
And I'll protect you too. I'll protect my dear captain. 
Kanna... 
Kanna said she was going to take a rest, right? 
I'll leave her alone till it's time for the mission. 
Oh, Mon Frère... 
Iris? What's wrong? What are you doing here? 
... 
I was just... looking outside. 
It's not every day you get to see the top of the clouds like this, huh. 
I always thought that Heaven was on top of the clouds. 
But where we're going... It's not Heaven, is it? 
... 
If we die... Where do you think we'll go? 
Mon Frère... Do you know where Heaven is? 
Who knows? 
We can’t go to Heaven yet. 
Who knows? Not me. 
I see... So you don't know either, huh... 
But if everyone knew where Heaven was, everyone would be trying to go there, right? 
Then Heaven would get overcrowded. 
Heheh... That's true. 
We're not going to Heaven just yet. There's still all kinds of stuff you want to do, right, Iris? 
I... I want to go on a date with you. 
Hahaha, I see. Then it's way too early for us to go to Heaven. 
...Yeah. 
Iris... You don't have to think about that kind of stuff yet. 
We're still alive. We don't need to worry about being dead. 
Y-Yeah... 
So long as we're alive, there's all kinds of happy, fun things we can do. 
So don't think about dying, OK? 
OK, got it! 
I read in a book once that Heaven was a place full of happiness. 
But I'm the happiest whenever I'm with you, Mon Frère. 
Iris... 
Thanks, Mon Frère. I feel a little better after talking with you. 
OK, I'm gonna go now. Bye-bye, Mon Frère! 
Heaven, huh...? 
Right, about time for me to go, too. 
Hey, Mon Frère? Could you... hug me? 
...Huh? 
I want you to hug me... 
...Yeah, sure. 
Heehee! Yaaaay! 
We'll be together forever, Mon Frère! 
Let’s make sure we both make it back from this fight.
We're going home together no matter what! 
Yeah. No matter what. 
Uh-huh! That's a promise, Mon Frère. 
Thanks, Mon Frère. I'm gonna go now. 
All right, get some rest before the mission, OK? 
OOOK! See you later, Mon Frère! Bye-byyye! 
Let's go on a date when we get back! 
Hahaha. So it's a date, huh? 
Right, I'd better get going. 
I can see the capital down below. 
We can't afford to lose. We have to defend the city. 
Doesn't look like anyone's in the hangar. Guess I'll go somewhere else. 
Chieeef! 
That voice... Is that you, Kohran? 
Sorry I'm not in uniform, Chief. Been kinda busy. 
Kohran... Maintaining the Koubu, I take it? 
This final battle's gonna be the Koubu Kai's shining moment. 
I was just running one last inspection on these babies. 
I see... 
We can always count on you. 
Don't overdo it. 
I'm sure the Koubu will give it 120% now that you've serviced them. 
We can always count on you, Kohran. 
Aww, Chief... You don't need to say that. 
It's only because you're here that I'm able to work this hard. 
Kohran, servicing the Koubu's all well and good, but don't overdo it, OK? 
I'll be fine. I always feel the most at ease when I'm fiddling around with machines. 
Working on the Koubu might even be more relaxing for me than resting in my room. 
Hahaha, I see, sounds about right for you. 
...Thanks for looking out for me, Chief. I mean it. 
I'm so happy you're there for me. 
What's wrong, Chief? You're looking kinda serious. 
Lemme guess, you're worried about the Koubu's power? 
No, that's not it... 
It's thanks to you we all got this far, Chief. 
It's thanks to you that we've grown and become stronger. 
The way we are now, we'll be able to squeeze out every last drop of the Koubu's power. 
Kohran... 
Wipe the oil from her face. 
Leave. 
Kohran, you've got a little oil on your face. 
Ah, Chief, you don't have to wipe it off for me or anything... 
It's fine, hold still. 
Chief... 
Your hand is so... warm. 
I hate to admit it, but as much as I love machines, they don't have the same warmth your hand does. 
It's because you're alive that your hand's so warm... 
And it's because I'm alive that I can feel that warmth. 
Kohran... 
Ogami... No matter what happens... Let's make it out of there alive. 
I want to keep feeling this warmth. 
Yeah. We will. We're getting out of there alive. 
Yeah. 
Ah... Ahahaha! Sorry for saying all that weird stuff, Chief. 
Right, well... Back to work, back to work. 
OK, I'll be going, then. Good luck with your maintenance, Kohran. 
All right, see ya later in the command room. 
Kohran must be working on the Koubu somewhere where I can't see her. 
I don't want to get in the way of her work, so I'll just get going. 
Hey, Reni. Were you resting in here? 
...Yeah. 
How do you like your new Flower Division uniform? 
...Yeah. 
... 
Reni... 
... 
I haven't been exercising at all, but my palms are drenched with sweat. 
My heart rate is also faster than usual. 
We're not even fighting yet... Have I gone crazy? 
Reni... 
You're not crazy at all. 
So even you feel nervous…
You're not crazy at all. You're just feeling nervous. 
I'm... nervous? 
It's natural to feel nervous before entering a big battle like this. 
... 
So even you can feel nervous, huh, Reni? 
Nervous... 
The way your hands are sweaty and your pulse is higher, it must be because you're nervous. 
... 
I'd only ever read about this in books before. 
So this is what it's like... to be nervous. 
My present symptoms do seem to match. 
... 
I was thinking about a lot of things just now. 
What would happen if we lost... If we died... 
I'd never thought about that sort of thing before. 
And when I did... My heart rate got faster. 
That happens to me too whenever I think about losing a battle or dying. 
It's because I don't want to lose. Because I don't want to die. 
Because I don't want to be apart from the people I care about. 
... 
I... don't want to be apart from everyone, either. 
I don't want to lose. I don't want to die yet. 
It's all right, Reni. We won't lose, and we won't die. 
I'll protect everyone in the Flower Division... and you. 
Captain... 
I think the symptoms of my nervousness have cleared up. 
Hahaha, glad to be of some help. 
Get some rest while you can. I'll be going. 
...Thanks, Captain. 
Captain... I'm actually fine, right? 
I'm not sick or anything... right? 
Reni... 
OK, let me see your face, then. 
Ah... 
Yep, you're fine. Same as always. 
Captain... 
You don't have to worry, Reni. So long as you believe in me... in everyone... you'll be all right. 
...Yeah. 
Though... It feels like my pulse has gotten even faster than before. 
All right, I'll be going now, Reni. 
OK. <br> Captain... Thanks. 
Reni said she'd be resting before we have to depart, right? 
I'll leave her alone till it's time for the mission. 
Wh-What is this place?! 
Ah, Mr. Ogami! 
Arf, arf! Woof! 
Ah! Tsubomi and 
! 
What the heck is this room? 
Heheh, the Grand Imperial Theater transformed so it could fit inside the Mikasa…
That’s why the seating area is now flipped upside-down.
I see, so that's what this is. 
By the way, I didn't know you two were aboard as well. 
Whoa, this room's upside-down, too. 
Looks like I'm in the audience seating area. 
Ah, Mr. Ogami! 
Arf, arf! Woof! 
Ah! Tsubomi and 
! 
You two also came aboard?
Heheh, yup! I can't work on the bridge just yet... 
But everyone's letting me help with making tea and meals. 
Now all my hard work as a waitress is starting to pay off! 
I see... 
We can’t do much besides support you all from the sidelines…
But we’ll do our best to help in any way we can! Good luck guys!
Arf, arf, arf! 
Haha, thanks Tsubomi, 
. 
 
and I are rooting for you, Mr. Ogami! 
Arf, arf! 
Hahaha, thanks. 
I'll do my best, on everyone's behalf. 
Wh-What is this place?! 
Ah, Ensign Ogami! 
Eep! Y-You're all here too? 
What even is this room, anyway? 
The entire Grand Imperial Theater was transformed to fit inside the Mikasa. 
So now our room's upside down, too. 
I-I see. So that's what this is. 
Oh, this area’s upside down as well. Looks like it's the Rose Division's room. 
But then... That means... 
EEEEEK! Ichirooo! 
Ensign Ogami! Good work out there! 
Ogami... 
So you're all aboard the Mikasa, too. 
But of course. We wouldn't dream of missing such a historic battle. 
When the time comes, Ensign Ogami, you must win with beauty... 
Fight with love in your heart... 
And come back safely, no matter what. 
Everyone... Thank you. 
Go give that dumb ol' Musashi a thrashing, Ichiro! 
I know... you can do it... Ogami. 
The Rose Division, the secret unit of love and beauty, will be supporting you from the Mikasa. 
OK. Thank you. 
Ah, Ogami. Nice fighting earlier. 
Seriously, for a second there, I thought the Mikasa was done for! 
But we were able to break through the Kouma's defensive line! Nice job as always, Ogami! 
Thank you, everyone. 
But it's thanks to all of you that the Mikasa's gotten this far. 
We'll be counting on you for the infiltration, too. 
Yes, sir. Just leave the Mikasa to the Wind Division! 
On that note, we're going to go on a short break ourselves. 
Let's make this mission a success! 
Oh, Ogami. Did you need something? 
Not really, I just sort of wandered into here. 
Is that so? If you're looking for Commander Yoneda, he's taking a rest in another room. 
...I see. 
It's finally time. 
I'm trying to cheer everyone up, just like you said, Kaede... 
But I think the one who's the most nervous about going into battle might be... me. 
Ogami, anxiety and fear aren't anything to be ashamed of. 
I'd be lying if I said I also wasn't feeling anxious right now. 
But yet... I'm not worried. 
I know you and the Flower Division can defeat any enemy! 
The commander and myself, we believe in all of you... So we're not worried. 
Kaede... 
You and the Flower Division are protecting the capital's future. Good luck, Ogami. 
...Yes, ma'am! 
Ogami, have you talked to everyone yet? 
No, not all of them. 
Your words and actions can help support everyone. 
It might be hard for you, but please, take care of the Flower Division. 
Right, understood. 
Sakura... She's not in her cabin. 
I'll go check elsewhere. 
Sakura seems to be resting in her quarters. 
I'll leave her alone until it's time for the mission to begin. 
Doesn't seem like Sumire's here. 
I wonder where she could've gone? 
Sumire seems to be resting inside. 
I should leave her alone until it's time to begin the mission. 
Maria? I wonder where she could be... 
Oh well, I'll go somewhere else. 
Maria seems to be resting inside. 
There's only so much time to rest before the mission begins, so I'll leave her be. 
Huh? Iris isn't in her cabin. 
Hmmm, where could she have gone? 
Iris should be resting inside right about now. 
I'll leave her alone, at least until it's time for the mission.
Kohran's not in her quarters. 
It's possible she could be in the hangar right now. 
Looks like Kohran's still working on the Koubu in the hangar. 
With her on the job, I have no doubt the Koubu will be in perfect shape for the mission.
Orihime? Doesn't look like she's in. 
Oh well, guess I should go to another room. 
Orihime's taking her siesta until the mission starts. 
You don't have a lot of time, but get plenty of rest, OK? 
All hands reporting for duty, Commander Yoneda. 
Hm. Everyone's looking a lot better. 
Good. It's finally time to put our plan into motion, then. 
Commander. <br> I have just one question. 
The inside of Musashi is bound to be crawling with a countless number of Kouma. 
How are we supposed to make it through a swarm of enemies like that? 
An astute observation, Maria. Just as I'd expect from you. 
But not to worry. <br> I've come up with a plan. 
There's just one way left to seal away evil. 
It's called... "The Rite of Four Swords." 
The Rite of... Four Swords? 
A technique capable of sealing away evil, using four spirit swords passed down since antiquity. 
These four weapons are made up of two swords and two blades. 
Commander Yoneda's Divine Blade Mekkyaku... 
Major Yamazaki's Luminous Blade Mukei... 
Colonel Shinguji's Spirit Sword Arataka... 
And finally, my older sister Ayame's Divine Sword Shirahatori. 
Wait, those are all... 
That's right. They're all members of the Anti-Kouma Corps, the precursor to the Imperial Assault Troupe. 
The Anti-Kouma Corps was made up of the inheritors of each of these swords. 
Eight years ago, during the Kouma War, when the Kouma appeared in the capital... 
The four of us attempted the Rite of Four Swords in an effort to seal them away. 
However... <br> We unfortunately lacked the power needed for the ritual. 
The Rite of Four Swords had failed, and we couldn't seal away the Kouma. 
In the end, Kazuma... He sacrificed his life and used the Power of Purification. 
... 
Ogami already has my Divine Blade Mekkyaku, and Sakura has the Spirit Sword Arataka. 
I'd like you two to perform the Rite of Four Swords. 
Huh?! <br> You want... US to do it? 
You two are the only ones who know how to wield a sword. 
Besides... With you two performing the rite, I know it'll succeed this time. 
Deep within Musashi must lie the source of the demonic energy powering it. 
If you can destroy that power source with the Rite of Four Swords, you can seal away the evil. 
... 
…Understood. 
…Understood. I'll give it a shot. 
And you, Sakura? 
Yes! Ogami and I will do it together! 
Thank you, both of you. 
We're entrusting all of our futures to you two. 
... 
Let's do this, Ogami. 
Let's seal away this evil, with our power, for our futures. 
Yeah. Let's give it a shot, Sakura. 
Thank you, both of you. 
We're entrusting all of our futures to you two. 
Commander Yoneda. We've finished our inspection of our six main engines. 
Preparations are complete, ready to begin the mission! 
It's finally time. Right, to the bridge! 
Awaiting your orders, Commander. 
This ship is about to engage in a full-scale assault against Musashi! 
After we hit the Musashi with the main cannon, we'll ram directly into it! 
Following that, we'll launch the Thunderstrike, loaded with all your Koubu. 
The Mikasa will then withdraw immediately thereafter. 
Finally, the Flower Division will infiltrate the core of Musashi and destroy it from the inside! 
I'm counting on you, Ogami! 
Yes, sir! 
Main engines, accelerate to full power! 
Main engines, outputting at full power! 
Mikasa, full speed ahead. <br> Destination: Musashi!! 
Destination: Musashi! 
Commander! The main cannon is ready to fire! 
It's finally time, Commander. 
Yeah... <br> Time to give 'em one hell of a show! 
Whoooooa! 
S-Status report, now! 
Main engines... <br> All operational! No anomalies detected! 
No anomalies detected in the spirit energy systems, either! 
The Mikasa has successfully penetrated Musashi! 
Good, so we did it, huh? 
Heheh, looks like we're finally up. 
We're counting on you, everyone. Once you get back, we're gonna have ourselves a party! 
We'll be supporting you from the bridge, everyone! 
To all of you in the Flower Division: even in the midst of battle, never forget about beauty. 
Ichirooo! I'm gonna give you so many smooches when you get back! 
I'll be praying... for your safety. 
I know you can do it, everyone. 
You'll have to tell me aaaall about what the inside of Musashi was like once we get back home! 
Please... Make sure to come back home! 
Thanks, everyone! 
The time has finally come. 
Kaede... 
Before you go off to fight... There's something I want to ask you. 
What's your attitude going into this battle? 
We're coming back alive! 
We must win at any cost!
We're going to defeat Kyogoku... And we're coming back alive! 
Very good... <br> You pass, Ogami. 
We must defeat Kyogoku, no matter the cost! 
In that case, if you're serious... Then I can't let you go. 
Huh?! 
What's your answer, Ogami? 
R-Right, it's kind of a difficult question, so I was just thinking hard about it…
...Keep it together. You're going to make me worried if you go out like that. 
That battle two years ago... My older sister, Ayame, was the troupe's deputy commander at the time. 
Ayame gave her life to put an end to that battle. 
But we can't keep protecting peace at the cost of people sacrificing their lives. 
I think you know how that feels for the ones left behind. 
... 
Promise me, Ogami. 
Promise me that you and the others will come back home alive. 
Kaede... 
You must not die. <br> You mustn't even think it's OK to die. 
Ogami... You'll promise me that, won't you? 
I promise. 
I promise. <br> We're all coming back from this together! 
...Thank you, Ogami. 
Ogami... Answer me. 
Ogami, this is one of the four swords: the Divine Sword Shirahatori. 
The Demon King... <br> No, Colonel Kazuma Shinguji holds the Luminous Blade Mukei. 
With it, you should be able to perform the Rite of Four Swords. 
Yes, ma'am. 
Now, you'd better get going. We're all waiting for your safe return. 
OK, we'll be right back! 
Captain, the Flower Division is ready to deploy. 
The Thunderstrike has finished undergoing maintenance as well. 
I see... <br> So it's finally time. 
Time for the final battle. 
Everything's gone according to plan so far. 
It's our turn from here on out! 
The Koubu are in tip-top shape! 
I'm gonna do my very best! 
The climax starts here. 
Everybody, don't let your guard down. 
Yeah. Time to get fired up! 
Awaiting your orders, Ogami! 
Awaiting your orders, Ensign! 
Awaiting your orders, Captain! 
Give us the order, Boss! 
Waiting for your orders, Mon Frère! 
Waiting on you, Chief! 
Awaiting your orders, Ensign! 
Your orders, Captain! 
Assault Troupe, move out!
We're coming back alive!
Imperial Assault Troupe, move out! It's time for our final battle! 
Sir, yes, sir! 
All pilots aboard the Thunderstrike! Time to infiltrate Musashi! 
We're coming back from this... alive! Only when every one of us returns will it be a true victory! 
Yes, sir! 
All pilots aboard the Thunderstrike! Time to infiltrate Musashi! 
Everyone... I don't have anything special to say. 
We're all coming back from this together, just like we always do! 
Yes, sir! 
All pilots aboard the Thunderstrike! Time to infiltrate Musashi! 
Sorry, Ogami. I can only sell you one photo per month. 
I see. That's too bad. 
So sorry, Mr. Ogami, but each customer is only allowed to purchase one photo at a time.  
Oh, really? That's too bad.
