It's been a long time since you've visited Sendai, right, Sakura?
Yes. I haven't been home ever since I left for Tokyo.
My mother, grandmother, and their helper, Gonjii, live there.
I wonder how they're doing…
I'm feeling kind of nervous about meeting your family.
You don't need to be so formal with them, Ogami.
Well, that's easy enough for you to say, but…
You both seem very close, don'tcha?
Huh?
Oh, pardon me.
I was watching how well you two were getting along and the words just slipped out.
Are you visiting this young lady's home to announce your marriage?
Well, something like that.
N-No, that's not it.
Well, something like that.
O-Ogami!
Ah, I knew it. That's exactly what I thought the moment I laid my eyes on you.
Good luck, young man.
Y-Yes, ma’am.
Sheesh, Ogami…
N-No, that's not it. We're, uh, how do I put this…
Th-That's right, we're not getting married or anything…
Oh, is that so? I'm terribly sorry.
In that case, are you running off in secret to elope?
Th-That's not it at all, ma'am!
(What kind of people does she think we are?!)
U-Um, you see…
Ah, I knew it. Youth is a wonderful thing.
That being said, though, this isn't the kind of decision to make lightly.
You should properly introduce yourself to the girl's parents, for her sake as well as your own.
Y-Yes, ma’am.
Sheesh, Ogami…
That old lady totally thought that you and I were getting married.
Riding the train like this is nice every once and a while.
It's been half a year since I've been home, half a year since that whole mess happened.
Really? Has it already been that long since we broke into your estate?
We might've gone a little overboard at the time…
That's true. In fact, if I were you, Ensign…
I'd prepare to get an earful from Miyata, our butler.
H-Hey, wait…
It's OK, I'm not afraid.
…I'm going home.
H-Hey, wait… What if we get into another fight?
Oh, Ensign, I'm only kidding.
Miyata may be stubborn, but he's not unreasonable.
Besides, that's all in the past now. I'm sure nobody minds anymore.
Oh, I-I see…
It's OK, I'm not afraid. I didn't do anything wrong.
I see. As I expected, Ensign.
I feel the same way. There's nothing for us to be ashamed of.
We can walk through those gates with our heads held high.
Yeah, sure.
…I'm going home. <br> I'm scared now.
What are you so afraid of, Ensign?
B-But…
If you are confident in your actions, then there's no need to be distressed.
We should walk through those gates with our heads held high. Am I wrong, Ensign?
Y-Yeah. <br> I get what you mean.
I see… I suppose that's possible.
Oh, Ensign. I was merely joking.
You need not worry, nobody in the Kanzaki estate would be so obstinate.
Besides, we didn't do anything to be ashamed of.
We can walk through those gates with our heads held high.
I see. You're right.
Count Hanakoji's estate is in Yokohama, right?
Yes. We should arrive there shortly by train.
I haven't visited the Count since last spring, when I left for the US.
Right, you were off in America.
If I remember right, didn't you live in the States some time ago?
…Yes. I found myself in America after defecting from Russia.
Afterwards, I was scouted by the Imperial Assault Troupe and came to Japan.
I'm used to greeting the New Year in foreign countries by now…
Maria…
Let's enjoy ourselves.
How does Japan compare?
It's just the two of us this New Year's. Let's enjoy ourselves.
…Yes, you're right. Thank you, Captain.
How does the Japanese New Year stack up, from your point of view?
It's quite enjoyable. Eating ozoni, visiting temples…
But no matter which country you go to, New Year's remains the same.
The desire for the next year to be a good one is the same no matter where in the world you are.
I see…
I'm sorry. I was rambling.
No, it's fine.
But getting to be alone with you, sir… I think this will be a great holiday.
Yeah, I'm glad I can be with you, too.
Let's have a great New Year, Maria.
Yes, Captain.
Woo! The ocean breeze feels great, doesn't it, Boss?
Yeah, it does. It's a little cold, though.
Unlike the capital, it's always hot in Okinawa, even in winter.
…Sorry for draggin’ you out all this way, though.
It's all right.
I had nothing better to do.
It's all right. Besides, I wanted to spend the New Year with you anyway.
Boss… Thanks.
I think this is gonna be the best New Year's ever.
Kanna…
Eh, I had nothing better to do anyway.
Oh, is that how it is, Boss?
In that case, maybe you'd prefer swimmin’ in the freezin’ ocean?
Eep! I-I'll pass!
Hahaha! Relax, I'm kiddin’.
Right, let's get inside and have ourselves a snack.
Huh? But we just had lunch.
So what? Eating tons of different food is one of the best parts about traveling!
C'mon, Boss, let's go already! Hurry!
Hahaha, got it.
At this rate, I'm gonna put on a few pounds before we even reach Okinawa…
Eheheh! <br> I'm so glad I get to go out with you, Mon Frère!
Hahaha. You sure are excited, aren't you?
Uh-huh! It's kinda like we're on a date!
Hey, Mon Frère. Do you wanna… hold hands?
Sure, why not?
I'm kind of embarrassed…
Sure, why not?
Heheheh, thanks! I feel so happy…
Don't let go of my hand until Papa and Mama's boat gets here, OK?
OK, got it.
There's so many people here… I feel kind of embarrassed.
Jeez, way to spoil the mood, Mon Frère!
B-But Iris… We can't just hold hands on the train…
Whatever! You're such a wimp, Mon Frère!
BLEHHH!
(Oh boy, this date is quite the handful already...)
Well, since you're being so quiet, Mon Frère…
I'll just go ahead and hold your hand!
H-Hey, Iris! Wait a second!
It's all right, Mon Frère! After all, we're a couple!
…Say, do you think those two are...?
Good heavens, what a dazzling pair those youngsters make.
Heheheh! <br> We're the center of attention, Mon Frère!
Hahaha… L-Looks like it…
Ahh, a relaxed boat ride like this ain't so bad every once in a while.
Haha… That's for sure.
Sorry for dragging you all the way out to Kobe, Chief.
It's all right, I wanted to meet this Mr. Howard of yours anyway.
Heheh… <br> What kind of person do you think Mr. Howard is, Chief?
He must love machines.
He's probably very serious.
He's probably really funny.
He loves machines, right?
Haha, that's right! He's something like a teacher to me, y'know!
He's probably a very serious person…
Nah, he's not serious in the least!
He's getting up there in age, and he loves to mess with machines.
Wow… He likes machinery just like you.
Yep, that's right. He's something like a teacher to me, y'know!
He's probably a really funny guy, huh?
That's right! He loves surprising people with the weird stuff he invents.
Hahaha, sounds kind of like you.
Haha, well, he was my teacher, y'know.
Hmm, I have no idea what kind of person he could be.
He's a funny old guy who loves coming up with weird inventions to surprise people with.
Well, to tell the truth, he's something like a teacher to me.
Before I joined the Imperial Assault Troupe, I was living with Mr. Howard in Kobe.
He taught me a whole lot about machinery during that time.
I had no idea…
Well, if you wanna know more, you'll have to meet him to find out!
By the way, Chief, you feeling hungry at all?
Now that you mention it, I could go for something to eat.
Heheh, that's why I brought some candy, just for such an occasion!
Good thinking as always, Kohran!
Leave it to me! All right, let's head inside and have a bite together.
Hm hm… <br> I still can't believe Mamma would travel to Japan.
When I wrote to her about Papa, she came right over.
She really must've wanted to see Mr. Ogata.
By the way, Mr. Ensign, what kind of person do you think my Mamma is like?
Beautiful, like you.
Quiet, like you.
Scary, like you.
I imagine your mother is beautiful, just like you.
You imagine correctly! My Mamma is really pretty!
I hope you're looking forward to meeting her!
I imagine your mother is a quiet person, just like you.
You shouldn't say something unless you actually mean it, Mr. Ensign!
I am not a "quiet person," if I do say so myself!
R-Right. Sorry.
I imagine your mother's scary, just like you.
A-Am I really that scary?
Hmm… Not lately, I guess.
You used to be quite outspoken, though.
C-Come on, now, that was so very long ago.
My mamma is very pretty, AND very nice!
Even if you make a mistake, she won’t get mad at you. So just relax.
Hmm… I have no idea what kind of person she could be.
My mamma is just like me: elegant, kind…
And most of all, beautiful!
I hope you're looking forward to meeting her!
Eeek!
Whoa… Are you all right, Orihime?
This is my first time riding a Japanese train… How unstable it is!
Hahaha, this is your first time, huh?
…Mr. Ensign, can I hold onto your arm so I don't fall over?
Huh? You're not gonna use the handles?
I'd prefer to hold onto you, Ensign.
Look, I will just lock your arm with mine!
Hahaha, this is kind of embarrassing. But, eh, oh well.
…Are all these people also going to visit the shrine?
This train is headed towards Meiji Shrine, so maybe.
…
Captain… Why did you invite me out?
Because I wanted to.
Because you were alone.
I just wanted to go with you. Is that not enough of a reason?
No, it is… Lately I feel like I've come to understand that sort of sentiment.
I see…
I just thought you might be lonely all by yourself.
I wasn't particularly lonely. It's always been like that for me.
But wouldn't you rather be with someone than all by yourself?
…I won't deny that.
Hmm… I dunno, I guess.
I see… You didn't have a reason, then.
Ah… S-Sorry, I didn't mean to offend you.
No, it's fine.
Oh, looks like we're almost there.
Let's enjoy ourselves, all right, Reni?
…Yeah.
Well, we finally made it to Sendai.
Everything outside of the station is covered in snow.
But thank goodness the weather's nice and clear.
All right, Ogami, shall we start heading towards my home?
Yeah, let's.
Why don't we take a detour?
Yeah, let's. I'm sure you want to see your family as soon as possible.
That’s true. OK, let’s be on our way.
Why don't we take a detour while we're here, Sakura?
Huh? A… detour?
Yeah, do you know any interesting places nearby?
Interesting places, huh? Let's see…
Oh, I know. There is one place, but…
It's not exactly a famous landmark of Sendai or anything. Is that all right?
Huh, where is it?
Heehee, you'll just have to wait and see.
All right, Ogami, follow me.
Is there something in these woods, Sakura?
Straight ahead, do you see that large tree, Ogami?
…I do, but it seems to be nothing but a stump.
Do you remember the story I shared with you a year or so ago?
The story about the time I climbed a tree as a kid with my childhood friend, Takeshi…
And how Takeshi was seriously hurt after lightning struck the tree while he was climbing…
Eh? Then this tree is…
…That’s right, this is the same tree that was struck by lightning all those years ago.
What’s this? Is… Is that you, Sakura?
Huh?
I knew it, it IS you! Long time no see!
...?
What, have you forgotten about me? It's me, Takeshi! Takeshi Matsumoto!
Huh?! Takeshi?! Takeshi, is that really you?! Wow, it's been ages!
Are you here for the holiday?
Classes are out for the New Year, so I’ve come home for the holiday.
…Huh? Who's this, Sakura?
Ah, this is Ichiro Ogami.
I'm currently working at a theater in the capital where he's always looking out for me.
I see… Pleased to meet you, Ogami. My name is Takeshi Matsumoto.
I'm Ichiro Ogami.
You were hit by lightning… 
I'm Ichiro Ogami.
You were hit by lightning… 
I'm Ichiro Ogami.
I want to know you better.
You were hit by lightning… 
Ichiro Ogami. Pleased to meet you.
And it’s the other way around. Sakura’s the one who's always looking out for me at the theater.
Haha, so formal! You sound just like a soldier, Ogami.
…
…Um, oh yeah! What are you up to these days, Takeshi?
Hey… Aren't you the guy that got struck by lightning when you were little?
Hahaha! Sakura told you about that, did she?
It was quite the mess back then, but I made it out alive.
Now a Jizo statue's been placed here to prevent such an accident from ever happening again.
I see…
That reminds me, what are you up to these days, Takeshi?
If you don't mind, I'd like to get to know you better.
O-Ogami! What's this all of a sudden?!
Hahaha, you're a funny guy, Ogami!
If you want to know more about me, then I'll gladly tell you.
Come on, Ogami, say something.
Oh, it's fine. I'm the one who interrupted you two, after all…
Nowadays, I'm studying to become a doctor at Tohoku Imperial University's medical department.
It's thanks to doctors that I managed to survive being struck by lightning.
Ever since then, I've wanted to work in a profession where I can save lives.
I see… So you're a university student now.
And I hear you're a famous actress in the capital, right?
I'll be working hard to become a doctor, so let's both keep doing our best, OK?
…Thanks, Takeshi.
Well, looks like you've found yourself a nice guy, so I guess there's nothing for me to worry about, huh?
Oh, stop it, Takeshi!
Hahaha! Sorry, sorry.
All right then, Ogami, if you'll excuse me.
Sorry, Ogami. Takeshi's always been like that.
It's all right, I don't mind.
It's nice that you got to see each other again after so long.
Yes. I'm glad that Takeshi seems to be doing well.
All right, it's about time I showed you where my home is.
When I was little, I was climbing trees with my childhood friend, Takeshi…
Lightning struck the tree Takeshi was on, and he got seriously hurt.
This is the very tree that got struck by lightning that day.
Wow… So it was this tree, huh?
Takeshi managed to survive somehow.
But now there's a Jizo statue placed here to prevent such an accident from ever happening again.
I had no idea…
I've been afraid of thunder and lightning ever since…
This place holds a lot of memories for me.
I see. I suppose it is a landmark of sorts, for you.
Thanks for showing me, Sakura.
No, thank you for coming here with me.
All right, let's get going to my house.
Hmm, yeah, there's nowhere in particular I want to go, so let's just do that.
OK. Right then, I'll show you the way.
This is my home, Ogami.
Wow… What a nice house.
Heehee, it's just old, that's all. Come on in.
Oh… Sakura.
Ah, Mother… <br> Happy New Year.
I’m finally home again.
Happy New Year, Sakura. Now then, it's cold out, so please, come in…
Well now… <br> Who might this be?
This is Ichiro Ogami, captain of the Imperial Assault Troupe's Flower Division.
Oh my, how nice of you to visit. I am Wakana Shinguji, Sakura's mother.
Pleased to meet you.
Pleased to meet you, Mom.
Uh… P-Pleased to meet you…
Pleased to meet you, Mom.
Pleased to meet you, I'm Ichiro Ogami.
Pleased to meet you, Mom. I'm Ichiro Ogami.
O-Ogami! You can't just call her "Mom"!
Straight to the point, isn't he, Sakura?
Uh… P-Pleased to meet you! I'm Ichiro Ogami.
I apologize for the late greeting.
You can relax, Ogami.
O-Ogami…
Ah… S-Sorry for the late introduction. My name is Ichiro Ogami.
Thank you for always being there for my daughter.
Sakura always makes sure to write about you in her letters.
M-Mother! You don't have to mention that…
Now then, you must be tired from your long trip. Please come inside.
Yes, ma'am. <br> Pardon the intrusion.
You can use this room while you're staying here, Ogami.
Would this happen to be...?
…Yes. It was my father's room when he was still with us.
His photo is above the desk…
It's a picture from when he was transferred to the Anti-Kouma Corps.
So this is Colonel Kazuma Shinguji…
He looks like a just man.
He looks like a calm man.
He looks like a kind man.
He was a man with a strong sense of justice, wasn't he?
…Yes. He fought as a part of the Anti-Kouma Corps, the precursor to the Assault Troupe…
In that sense, he's both my father and my superior officer.
He looks like he was a calm man.
…Yes. I'd say he was a rather quiet person.
He seems like he was a kind man.
…Yes. He was a valiant man with a strong sense of justice.
He was always the kindest person in the room.
This room's remained untouched since my father departed for the capital.
We left everything just as it was, as though he were to come home at any minute.
But my father… will never set foot in this room again.
All that's left is this photograph in his place…
…
But deep in my heart, the memory of my father lives on.
The times he’d give me piggyback rides… How he taught me swordsmanship…
Those memories are precious to me.
Sakura…
…Sorry, I've been rambling nonstop, haven't I?
Right, Mother's waiting for us in the living room. Let's go, Ogami.
Yeah, OK.
Allow me to reintroduce myself. My name is Wakana Shinguji.
Thank you for looking after Sakura.
N-Not at all, ma'am…
You two have come a long way.
Relax, and think of this home as your own.
Yes, ma'am. Thank you for your hospitality.
Mother, where's Grandmother?
Your grandmother left with Gonjii to visit the hot springs.
They'll likely be back in a day or two.
In that case, I'll introduce you when they get back, Ogami.
OK, sounds good.
You two must be exhausted. I've already drawn a hot bath, so by all means, enjoy it before dinner.
Sakura, could you bring Ogami your father's yukata?
Yes, of course!
Here you go, Ogami. This belonged to my father, but please wear it.
I’ll borrow it for now.
That may be a bad idea…
All right, I'll borrow it for now.
Heehee… That yukata sure brings back memories, doesn't it, Mother?
Yes, it truly does…
I don't think that's a good idea. It was your father's… Wouldn't that make it a keepsake of his?
It's all right, Ogami. I'm sure my father would want you to wear it.
She's right, Ogami. Now then, don't be shy.
I see… All right, if you insist.
Hmm…
There's no need to hesitate, Ogami. Take it.
I'm sure my father would be happy to see you wear it if he were here.
…All right then, if you insist.
How about trying it on to see if it fits?
Yeah, sure.
…How's this?
Wow… You almost look like Father… Doesn’t he, Mother?
Yes indeed… It suits you well, Ogami.
Th-Thanks… Much obliged.
All right, Sakura, could you show Ogami where the bathroom is?
Also, if you could light the fire for the bath, while you're at it.
Yes, of course!
Heehee, it's been so long since I've had to heat up a bath like this.
Now then, Ogami, let me show you the way to the bathroom.
OK, thanks.
Phew, that felt great. It'd been ages since I took a wood-fired bath.
Ogami? It's Wakana. May I come in?
Y-Yes, ma'am! C-Come in.
Pardon the intrusion.
How was your bath? I know it isn't much, but we boil the water every day.
R-Right, Sakura lit the kindling for me, so the water was great.
Sakura learned how from her grandmother, she's quite good at it.
By the way, Ogami…
Y-Yes.
Sakura hasn't been causing any of you trouble, has she?
Not at all.
Now that you mention it…
Not at all. She's been very helpful when it comes to cleaning and cooking…
And she's passionate about her work on stage.
I see… That's a relief.
Now that you mention it… She IS always glaring at me…
I'm so sorry. She can have a one-track mind at times.
…I knew it, she has been causing you trouble after all.
In any case, Sakura's always cheerful and hardworking.
I see… Just knowing my daughter is living a happy life is a relief.
…
…Ogami, could you join me outside for a moment?
Huh? OK…
…
…
I feel like I've missed out on life. I got married, lived at home, raised a child… And that's it.
As such, I'm a little jealous of Sakura…
…
*sigh* <br> What’s more, being a parent can often be tiresome.
In the end, the children act like they grew up all on their own…
Ogami, what do you fight the demons for?
In my case, I fight…
To protect the peace.
For the ones I love.
Protecting the peace in the capital ensures everyone there can be happy.
If I can help with that, even just a little bit, then I'm glad.
And… so that no more lives may be lost in vain.
I fight to protect the ones I love.
I fight so that no one precious to me will be lost fighting in vain.
I fight… so that they may live.
I… don't really know how to sum it up.
…
I'm sorry for asking such boring questions…
Now then, keep warm and have a good night's sleep.
Thank you.
The owner of this room, Colonel Shinguji, gave his life to protect the capital.
But… Was that really the right choice?
Well, Ensign, we've made it.
…It's been a while since I was last here.
Looks like the gate Kanna kicked down has been repaired.
Yes, even the gates of the mighty Kanzaki estate are no match for that brute's inane strength.
Why didn't you put a stop to her, Ensign?
No, I… <br> Y-You're right. Sorry.
This is where you had an altercation with Miyata, correct? I heard all about it afterwards.
I'm at your side today, so there's nothing for you to worry about. Now then, let's go in.
Boy, this mansion never ceases to amaze me.
Don't just stand there, Ensign, come along.
Even on the inside, this place is huge…
Everything's so big, my neck's starting to hurt from looking up all the time.
Oh, Ensign… You'll get lost if you keep gawking about like that.
Ah, Mistress Sumire! Is that you?
Hello, Miyata. How have you been?
I have been fortunate enough to remain in perfect health.
Now if you ever find yourself a suitor capable of being a proper husband…
I, Kyosei Miyata, can pass on from this world with no regrets.
Ohohoho… Same as ever, I see, Miyata.
I have brought a guest with me today.
This is Ensign Ichiro Ogami. I trust you remember him, don't you?
Ohh, Master Ogami! I must apologize for the trouble I caused you last time.
No, I should apologize.
You guys were tough.
No, I should be the one apologizing. We did get pretty violent…
Nonsense! You and the Flower Division were merely acting in Mistress Sumire's best interest.
I was unable to properly recognize it at the time.
What's more, the way you protected the manor afterward…
Was more than enough to make up for your uncouth behavior.
Even now I feel unbearable shame for the way I treated you!
Come now, Miyata. The ensign has forgiven you as well…
So please, forget about what happened and treat the ensign with your usual hospitality.
Yes, my lady! I swear on my life!
Man, you guys were tough. That was a hell of a fight.
Forgive me, sir! I am positively mortified at my behavior!
I was unable to recognize that you and the troupe only had Mistress Sumire's best interests at heart.
And what's more, you fought valiantly to protect the manor. You have my gratitude.
To think I would send our guards after you…
Even now I feel unbearable shame for the way I treated you!
Come now, Miyata. The ensign has forgiven you as well…
So please, forget about what happened and treat the ensign with your usual hospitality.
Yes, my lady! I swear on my life!
Forgive me, sir! I feel the utmost shame for my behavior!
You and the Flower Division were merely acting with Mistress Sumire's best interests at heart.
I was unable to properly recognize it at the time.
What's more, the way you protected the manor afterward…
Was more than enough to make up for your uncouth behavior.
Come now, Miyata, the ensign understands already, there's no need for the passionate speech.
By the way, Miyata, do you know where Grandfather and the others might be?
W-Well…
What's the matter? Take me to them, Miyata.
…Very well. Right this way.
Tadayoshi, Master Shigeki, and Mistress Hinako are preoccupied with greeting guests for the New Year.
You're right… Looks like a real handful.
…
M-My lady? Will that be all?
…Very well. I had a feeling this would happen.
Right then, Ensign. Let's make our way to my room.
Miyata, if you could tell my father and the others that we've arrived.
Y-Yes, my lady. Understood.
Now then, Ensign, allow me to show you my room.
Here we are. Please, come in.
Wow, so this is your room…
Everything is just as I left it before departing to join the Imperial Assault Troupe.
What a nice, cheery room.
It's a bit plain.
Is that a stuffed animal?
What a nice, cheery room.
Ohohoho… <br> You honor me with your compliments, Ensign.
It's a bit plain compared to your room at the theater, isn’t it?
Yes, my bedroom in the theater is decorated just the way I like it.
Hahaha, I see.
…Huh? Is that a stuffed animal I see?
D-Did I not mention that I've had this room since childhood?
Even I had stuffed animals when I was a young girl!
You don't have to get upset. I think it's kind of cute.
So even you doted on stuffed animals when you were a kid…
Goodness, you're impressed by the strangest things.
…Ensign, give me your honest impression, won't you?
Oh, uh, right. <br> It's… nice?
Ugh! That's hardly what I'd call an impression!
A proper gentleman must come up with a tasteful remark at a time like this!
R-Right…
Now then, Ensign, how about some tea?
Wait just a moment while I boil some water for us.
Sure. Thanks.
I'll put the Kinematron right here. Now please, make yourself at home.
Huh… So this is the room Sumire grew up in when she was little…
Hm? There's a stack of papers here.
Looks like there’s all kinds of stuff written on them…
Give them a read.
Now I'm curious. Maybe I'll read just a little bit.
"Dear Ensign, how has the past year treated you?"
"So long as I'm writing this letter, I should keep you abreast of my present situation."
"I have been… arranged to be wed."
Th-This is… a letter to me.
"As I write this, you're at sea, on the other side of the world."
"I await your return, alone, as the isolation tears me apart."
Wait… Are all of these letters to me?!
Sorry to keep you waiting, Ensign. The tea's-
…Ah! A-Are those...?
Ah… W-Well, uh…
E-Ensign! Don't read other people's letters without permission!
S-Sorry! I just found them here and got the urge to…
For goodness' sake! After I made you some tea, no less!
As punishment, you're going to drink this freshly-boiled, piping-hot water!
Eep! Th-That's going a little too far, Sumire!
(Sheesh… Don't do anything you wouldn't want to get caught doing, I guess.)
No, I shouldn't. I can't just snoop around people's rooms on a whim.
Sorry to keep you waiting, Ensign. The tea's ready.
Ah… O-OK!
(Good thing I didn't read them, or else Sumire definitely would've caught me.)
(Still… I can't help but wonder what's written on them.)
Ensign? Is something the matter?
N-Nope, nothing at all! Now then, let's enjoy this tea!
…Delicious. That was excellent, Sumire.
Naturally. I carefully prepared this tea to the best of my abilities.
Anyway, I wonder if your parents are still busy receiving guests…
It's always been like this. They're constantly busy, even during New Year's.
They might even make us wait until evening.
Hmm… I see…
…
I know! I just had the most wonderful idea!
Oh? What is it, Sumire?
I'll cook something for you, Ensign!
Huh?! Did you say… cook?!
Indeed. I'll put my heart and soul into crafting a culinary delight just for you.
I'm not sure about this…
I can't wait to try it!
I’m not sure that’s such a good idea. I mean, have you ever even cooked before?
Well now! That's quite rude to say before I've even been given a chance!
I don't need experience! Cooking is all about intuition!
R-Right…
Just wait in the hall and let me take care of it.
Sumire's cooking, huh? Hmm…
Well, I certainly am interested in how it'll turn out.
Right, I'll go ahead and wait in the hall, then.
Sumire’s cooking, huh… I can't wait to try it!
Ohohohoho, I figured as much.
With my natural intuition and talent, I'll make you a meal beyond compare!
Now then, Ensign, if you could wait in the hall until I've finished preparing your food.
It's not every day I get the chance to try Sumire's cooking.
OK, I'll go ahead and wait in the hall.
Now then, Ensign, if you could wait in the hall until I've finished preparing your food.
Soon you shall behold the cooking born from my boundless talent and intuition!
Hmm… I wonder what kind of dish it'll be.
Guess I ought to wait in the hall for now.
It's almost been an hour… I can't wait to try Sumire's homemade cooking.
Apologies for the wait, Ensign!
I have finally completed my special dish.
Really? I can't wait to see what it is!
Um… This is my first time cooking, so…
I'm not terribly confident, but if you enjoy it, then I'll be more than satisfied.
I'm just happy I get to eat something you made yourself, Sumire.
Ensign…
Right, let me bring out your entrée!
Bon appétit!
Wow! That's… That's an impressive dish!!
I started with the staples of gourmet dining, using foie gras, caviar, and truffles as a base.
Then I seasoned it with soy sauce to add some Japanese flavor.
Since I figured you were tired from the trip, I also enriched it with a little salt…
And I added just a pinch of sugar as a secret ingredient in my special, all-natural butter sauce.
You're always exhausted from work, so I poured my heart into making a meal that will revitalize you.
I… I see. Thank you, Sumire.
Now then, please, help yourself.
D-Down the hatch!
(Th-This flavor… Words can't even begin to describe it...)
Well, Ensign? How does it taste?
I'm not a fan…
I-It has a unique flavor.
I'm not a fan…
I-It has a unique flavor.
D-Delicious!
I'm not a fan…
Oh, Ensign, you're such a picky eater.
All right then, try the caviar and soy sauce stir fry.
I've never tasted anything like this before! I-It's unbelievable!
Ohohoho… <br> How typical of you to hide your embarrassment.
But if you enjoy it, simply say so. There's nothing to be ashamed of.
Y-You're right. Ha… Hahaha.
Um, how should I put this… It has a… unique flavor.
Ohohoho… <br> Yes, only I could be capable of such an exquisite flavor.
Y-You might be right.
D-Delicious! This flavor is unspeakable… Unspeakably good!
…I'm a little concerned it took you so long to answer.
N-No, that’s just because I was savoring every last bite!
Oh, Ensign. You flatter me.
Ah… It's so delicious that words fail you, is that it?
Well don't mind me, take your time and enjoy the food.
Aren't… Aren't you going to have some, Sumire?
I'm perfectly content with just watching you, Ensign.
Sumire…
Oh, don't mind me, please keep eating. There's plenty left for you to enjoy.
I… I see! Glad to hear it! Hahaha…
Oh, Sumire… <br> Welcome home.
(Hm? Was that...?)
Welcome home, Sumire. Sorry we were so preoccupied with our guests.
It's been like this ever since I was a child. I'm used to it.
I truly am sorry, Sumire… After you came all this way…
Oh, and you brought your boyfriend with you.
H-Hello.
Ah… I am Shigeki Kanzaki, Sumire's father… Uh, thank you for looking after my daughter.
I'm Hinako. Charmed.
Thanks for having me.
Sorry about last time.
Hello… Thank you for having me.
My, you're a handsome one, aren't you? Please, make yourself at home.
All right. Thank you, ma'am.
I'm terribly sorry about last time.
Last time? Oh, not at all, I'd already forgotten about it.
Please, make yourself at home.
Yes, ma'am. Much obliged.
Oh, there's no need to be so nervous.
Just relax and make yourself at home.
Yes, ma'am. Much obliged.
…Hm? What happened to this food?
Oh, this is Sumire's, she made it all by herself.
What?! Sumire cooked for you?!
Sumire's almost never set foot in a kitchen before, and now she's cooking…?
Yes, I cook. I'm capable of that much, at least.
Right, Ensign, allow me to clean up for you.
Thanks, Sumire. The food was delicious.
We still have some matters to attend to, so if you'll excuse us!
Let's talk some more later, Ogami.
Yes, ma'am. Thank you very much.
Sumire's parents… That was a little nerve-racking.
Sorry to disturb you, Ogami.
(Th-That voice!)
It's been a while. I'm Tadayoshi, Sumire's grandfather. You remember me, don't you?
O-Of course.
…So, how is the Imperial Assault Troupe these days?
You don't regret taking Sumire with you at the expense of my financial support, do you?
Not at all.
A little.
I don't regret it at all, sir. Sumire's a valuable member of the team.
Fwohoho… <br> Enthusiastic as ever.
Keep up the hard work, then, so that you won't have to come crawling back to me later.
Yes, sir!
Well… I do regret it a little bit.
Fwohoho… <br> Aren't we honest?
But a man never goes back on his word. You must take responsibility for your choices.
I will.
Hmm… That's a tough question.
Fwohoho… <br> What happened to all that enthusiasm from before?
A man never goes back on his word. You must stay true to your beliefs and never falter.
…Yes, sir.
Now then, I'll be taking my leave. Give Sumire my regards.
Huh? You're not going to see her yourself?
Sumire left us. I have no intention of seeing her.
Now, if you'll excuse me.
…
Wow… So this is the Count’s estate.
Hello, Count Hanakoji. Are you home?
That voice… Maria, is that you? And is that Ogami with you?
Welcome. I've been waiting for you two.
Apologies for not keeping in touch, sir. Thank you for all your help with the troupe.
Hahaha… You're the only man fit to lead the Flower Division, Ogami.
You two have come a long way. Please, come in.
Yes, sir. Pardon the intrusion.
I see, so Yoneda's also doing well. Very good, very good.
By the way, Maria, thank you for accompanying me to America last year.
Don't mention it, sir. I was glad to go back after so long.
You were a great help while we were there. Again, allow me to express my thanks.
By the way, I recall you were looking for something at the jeweler's back then. Did you ever find it?
You visited so many jewelry stores, so I figured…
C-Count Hanakoji! Please don't speak about that in front of the captain!
Oops, forgive me. I forgot I wasn't supposed to talk about that. Hahaha…
Huh?
Talk to Maria.
Talk to Hanakoji.
Maria… What were you looking for at the jewelry stores?
N-Nothing… <br> Nothing at all.
Oh, Count Hanakoji, look what you did.
Ah, I really am sorry. It just slipped out.
What exactly was Maria looking for, Count Hanakoji?
Well, I honestly don't know.
All I know is she was quite serious about visiting as many jewelers as she could.
…That's enough of that talk, you two.
(Hmm… Now I'm really curious.)
Never mind that, Captain, it's nothing important. It's a personal matter.
I see… Still, now you've got me curious.
Anyway, I'm glad you two came all this way to see me…
But my family never really observed New Year's, so I'm not doing anything particular to celebrate.
It must be quite dull for you to stay here, so why don't you two instead have yourselves a nice date?
All right, we will.
Huh?! W-We're not…
All right, we will.
Well, now. So you only want to go on a date because you're bored, is that it, Captain?
For what it's worth, I think you two make a lovely couple. Now, go on and have fun.
Oh, for goodness' sake! Please don't tease us, sir.
Huh?! W-We're not… We can't just go on a date…
Well, it is New Year's, after all. Maybe a date wouldn't be so bad for a change.
All right then, have fun, you two.
Yes, sir…
You don't have to think about it so hard. We're just going out together, that's all.
Going out together is what you'd call a "date," though, isn't it?
Oh, for goodness' sake! Please don't tease us, sir.
OK, where should we go, Maria?
I think I might have mentioned it to you before, Captain…
But I know a great café bar here in Yokohama.
Captain, I know a great café bar here in Yokohama.
If it's all right with you, why don't we stop by?
Sure, let's check it out.
I dunno, sounds fancy…
Sure, let's check it out. Might as well while we're in Yokohama.
Really? Then I'll take you there.
A café bar, huh? I dunno, sounds fancy…
It's all right, Captain. It's a quiet place, ideal for relaxing.
We might as well go while we're in Yokohama.
You're right. OK, let's go.
Hmm… What to do…
Captain, why don't we stop by while we're already in Yokohama?
Yeah, you're right. Let's check it out.
I want to see what kind of place this old haunt of yours is, anyway.
Thank you. Now then, I'll show you the way.
All right, we're here. This is the café bar, Captain.
Wow, this place looks fancy.
Let's head inside.
What a relaxed atmosphere. Figures you'd enjoy hanging out here.
You think so? I'm glad you like it.
Talk about Maria.
Talk about Hanakoji.
Talk about Maria.
Talk about Hanakoji.
Talk about the jewelers.
Talk about Maria.
Talk about the jewelers.
Talk about Hanakoji.
Talk about the jewelers.
Talk about Maria.
Talk about Hanakoji.
Talk about the jewelers.
It's been so long since we've been able to go out together like this.
That it has. I've been thinking of bringing you here for a while now, too.
This peace may be fleeting, but I want to cherish it while it lasts.
Yeah, I agree.
…Being here with you truly makes me happy, Captain.
Well at any rate, Count Hanakoji's a funny guy.
Yes, being one of Mr. Yoneda's old friends, it makes sense he'd be quite the joker.
But he's also a reliable ally, always caring for the troupe and thinking about the peace of the world.
Now that I think about it, we really ought to express our gratitude to him.
That reminds me… What exactly were you looking for at those jewelry stores?
…
…I thought you might ask. Seems like I don't have a choice but to tell you.
…Why bring this up all of a sudden, Captain?
S-Sorry, it's just, it's been bugging me for a while now…
I was hoping we could talk about other things, but oh well.
What I was looking for was… this locket.
I used to have another just like it, but…
Captain… You remember, right? I went to his grave and…
I said goodbye… to my old locket.
But I realized I needed to get a new one, no matter what.
In order to support myself…
Maria…
…I'm sorry.
Can you show me the inside?
…I'm sorry. I didn't mean to bring up such a sore subject.
It's all right. I feel relieved having talked about it.
It can be hard, shouldering your life on only your own shoulders.
Maria…
If it's all right… Could you show me whose picture is inside the locket?
I'm afraid not. It's a secret, and mine alone.
Hmmm… Now I'm curious.
Hm hm hm… <br> Whoever could it be?
…
That's enough about my locket.
Right then, Captain, where should we go after this?
Let's see… Where would you like to go, Maria?
Well… How about we visit the port!
I see, Yokohama's a port town, after all.
All right, let's get going.
No lollygagging, Captain! Hurry!
(Maria's leading me all over the place today, isn't she?)
We're here, Boss! We finally made it to Okinawa!
Yeah. <br> The sea, the sky… <br> It's all so beautiful.
Remember how you came to Okinawa with me two years ago?
Back then, we never had a chance to stop by my home island.
We were there to train, so I was hauling a ton of equipment, too.
All right, Boss, lemme show you my place.
It's just a short walk from here. Let’s get goin’.
There it is, Boss. This here's my house.
Wow, the walls are made of stone.
Yep, most Okinawan houses are like that.
Anyway, let's head inside for now.
Phew… There really is no place like home!
You lived here when you were little, right?
You could say that, but all I ever did was train in karate.
The building over there's a dojo now.
My old man and I would spar out in this garden all the time, too.
Does… nobody else live here anymore?
Yeah. After my dad passed, I lived here on my own for a while.
Ever since I joined the troupe, I come here every once in a while to keep the place clean.
That sounds rough.
Does that make you lonely?
That sounds rough. Isn't it hard, cleaning a place this big?
Nahhh, it's nothin'. Makes for good exercise.
Gotta take good care of your home, right?
Kanna…
So when you come back, there's nobody else here. Does that make you lonely?
…To be honest, sometimes, yeah.
Whenever that happens, I go in the dojo over there and train till I tire myself out.
Doin’ that distracts me from the loneliness a little.
But I'm fine now. I mean, you're here with me, right?
Hahaha, I'm glad to hear you say that.
Since ancient times, people in Okinawa have believed in goddesses known as "Unaigami."
It's said that Unaigami protect the men most precious to them.
Huh…
I couldn't do anything for my old man.
I… wasn't able to be his Unaigami.
But at the very least, I can protect this house and his grave.
Kanna…
Heheh, sorry, I was bein’ kind of a downer, there.
Heh, all right, Boss, while you're listenin’ to my story, could you come with me for a sec?
Huh? Where to?
To my dad's grave. C'mon, let's go.
Ah, there it is… <br> My old man’s grave…
Wow, Okinawan graves sure look different.
It's a kaaminakuu tomb. It's shaped like a woman's spread legs, so the dead can return to the womb.
Th-That's fascinating…
Yeah. It's a totally different way of thinking compared to the mainland.
Hey Dad, I'm home! Back for the first time in ages.
I brought my boss with me today, y'know, the one I told you about before.
If ya don't mind, Boss, could you offer up a word or two to my dad's grave?
A word, huh…
I'm Ichiro Ogami.
Your daughter's so strong.
I'm Ichiro Ogami, captain of the Imperial Assault Troupe's Flower Division.
Ms. Kanna's always been there to lend us her strength.
Hahaha, so it's "Ms. Kanna" now, huh? So polite, as always.
Thanks, Boss. I'm sure my dad's happy to have met you, too.
Your daughter's so strong. We spar all the time, and she beats the tar out of me.
B-Boss! You don't have to be so open ‘bout that stuff!
I figured it'd be best to let him know how things always are between us.
Hmm… Eh, all right.
The words just aren't coming to me.
It's all right, Boss, you don't need to say anything. You bein’ here is enough.
Here, Dad. I brought you awamori, your favorite. Drink up.
I also brought a bunch of your favorite food, like rafute and mimiga.
Hey, Dad… My boss is cool, right? Looks tough, right?
On top of that, though… He's really nice. He's someone you can really rely on.
It's like you always said, Dad. You can't only have a strong body, you need a strong heart as well.
I'll keep workin’ hard till I'm as strong as you… and my boss.
Kanna…
All right, Boss, how's ‘bout you and I have a drinkin’ contest while we're here?
Huh?! Here?!
We drink and we sing. It's the Okinawan way. It'll make Dad happy, too.
Really...? <br> All right! Got it.
OK, here's some awamori! Let's get our drink on!
All right, let's party!
I can't hold my liquor…
All right, while we're here, we might as well party!
That's what I'm talkin' about! You're always up for anything, Boss!
I can't really hold my liquor…
All right, eat, then! Pig out!
Yeah… All right, I'll do that, then.
C'mon, don't be such a party pooper! Drink and have fun, Boss!
Yeah… All right, I'll do that, then.
Eat up, Boss!
Yeah, sure. Man, Okinawan food goes really well with awamori.
Heh, I know, right? It's even better under an Okinawan sky like this, too.
Man, the food's great, and I got my boss here by my side! This is the best!
Don't mind us, Dad, we're just gonna do our own thing!
Kanna…
It's fine! He's the one who just had to go and die…
All right, we still got plenty of time! Time to party!
It's here! Papa and Mama are in that boat, Mon Frère!
Wow… That ship is huge.
C'mon, Mon Frère, let's go! Hurry!
Hahaha, OK, OK.
Yaaay! <br> Papaaaa! Mamaaaa!
Iris?!
Ohh, Iris!
Papa, Mama! I'm so happy you're here!
We can have lunch together and talk about all sorts of stuff!!
Y-Yes…
…Of course, let's do that, Iris.
Teehee! Heheh, I can't wait!
Papa, Mama, this is Mon Frère.
I'm Ichiro Ogami. Pleased to meet you.
It's been a long time. Thank you for your hospitality back when I visited France.
You haven’t seen them in a while, so let me introduce you again!
This is my papa and mama!
I'm Robert, Iris's father. Thank you for always looking after my daughter.
You may call me Marguerite. I'm Iris's mother.
Iris has told us so much about you in her letters.
Eheheh! Mama's really pretty, isn't she?
Your mother is beautiful.
You're her spitting image.
You're beautiful, too.
You have a beautiful mother.
Right? Right?
When I grow up, I'm gonna be pretty just like her!
Oh, Iris…
Hahaha, I can't wait.
She looks a lot like you, I was surprised.
You're her spitting image, Iris.
Uh-huh! I'm her child, after all!
When I grow up, I'm gonna be pretty just like her!
Oh, Iris…
Hahaha, I can't wait.
Your mother's beautiful, but so are you, Iris.
Huh? Really?
Yaaay, yaaay! <br> Mon Frère said I'm beautiful!
Oh, Iris…
Hahaha…
(She… She sure is beautiful...)
Ah! Mon Frère, you're bluuushiiing!
I'm gonna be just as pretty when I grow up, so just wait, OK?
Oh, Iris…
Hahaha, thank you Iris.
Mon Frère, Papa, Mama, come on. Let's go inside.
You're right. After you, Ogami.
Very well. Pardon me.
And then, and then! Guess what Mon Frère did?
I-Iris!
Hmhmhm, oh, Iris, you've done nothing but talk about Ogami this whole time.
R… Really? Heheh…
Whatever will we do with you?
Speaking of which, we received that letter from you and Iris a while ago, Ogami.
That's right. It made us very happy.
Do you remember how you described yourself, Ogami?
As a captain, right?
As a ticket puncher, right?
As Iris's boyfriend, right?
As captain of the Flower Division… Right?
Hmhm, sounds like you've already forgotten.
You wrote that you were a ticket puncher, if I recall.
Ah, now that you mention it, that might've been it.
Hmhm, sounds like you've already forgotten.
You rather boldly claimed to be Iris's "boyfriend," but I wonder if that's common in Japan…
…Huh? W-Was that it?
Ah… S-Sorry. That was rather brazen of me.
Yes, that's right, you remembered.
We wrote it together, after all, remember?
That letter truly reflected your serious personality, Ogami.
As the theater's ticket puncher… Right?
Hmhm, sounds like you've already forgotten.
You wrote that you were captain of the Flower Division, if I recall.
Ah, now that you mention it, that might've been it.
Yes, that's right, you remembered.
We wrote it together, after all, remember?
That letter truly reflected your unique personality, Ogami.
As Iris's boyfriend… Right?
Yes, that's right, you remembered.
You can't forget something that important!
That letter truly reflected your passionate personality, Ogami.
Hmm… I forgot.
Huh?! You already forgot, Mon Frère?!
Now, now, Iris, it was quite some time ago.
You wrote that you were a ticket puncher, if I recall.
W-Was that it?
That letter truly reflected your unique personality, Ogami.
You wrote that you were captain of the Flower Division, if I recall.
W-Was that it?
That letter truly reflected your serious personality, Ogami.
You rather boldly claimed to be Iris's "boyfriend," but I wonder if that's common in Japan…
…Huh? W-Was that it?
W-Was that it?
That letter truly reflected your passionate personality, Ogami.
When we read Iris's letters, we thought she might be doing well…
Yes, but we never would've imagined she would be this cheerful.
It's because my papa and mama are here! And Mon Frère too!
I know! If you marry me, Mon Frère, we can all be together forever!
Eep! H-Hang on a second, Iris…
Oh, Iris… Hmhmhm.
Well, if it'll make Iris happy, then we'll welcome you with open arms. Hahaha…
We're here, Chief. We finally made it to Kobe.
You must be excited. You finally get to see Mr. Howard again.
Sure am! All right, let's hustle over to Howard's!
Here it is, the home of Mr. Howard. The first house I lived in when I came to Japan.
Wow, so this is where you learned how to invent stuff, huh?
Yup. Now let's head inside.
Ring the doorbell.
Walk right in.
We should ring the doorbell first, just in case. I think it's this button…
OK, let's head inside!
Wait, don't open that door!
Huh?
This door will explode if you don't ring the doorbell first.
Really? Good thing I didn't open it, then.
All right, I'm gonna ring the doorbell now.
*cough* *cough*<br>Wh… What the…
Ohh! You always gotta ring the doorbell before coming in!
If ya don't, my Anti-Thief Trap will set a bomb off on ya!
Pops… <br> We DID ring the doorbell.
Oh… For real? Are you sure? Oh, looks like I messed up the sensitivity…
Failure's a natural part of the inventing process! Haha, don't sweat the small stuff! No problem!
J-Just what I'd expect from Kohran's teacher…
Now come in, you two, hurry along inside. Don't be shy!
You must be all tuckered out from your long trip. Grab whatever seat you like over there.
All right. Pardon me.
Allow me to reintroduce you, Chief. This here's my teacher, Percy Howard!
Howdy, Ogami! I've heard allll about ya from Kohran's letters!
Hello, I'm Ichiro Ogami.
Interesting dialect.
Pleased to meet you.
Pleased to meetcha!
Incidentally, that's an interesting dialect you've got, there.
Oh, ya think so?
Ever since I came to Japan, I've only traveled between Kyoto and Osaka, so that's why I talk like this!
Which wound up rubbing off on me, too.
Oh, I-I see…
I am the captain of the Imperial Assault Troupe's Flower Division. Pleased to meet you.
No, no, Ogami, ya don't gotta be so stiff! Loosen up a little!
A simple "pleased to meetcha" will do! Just relax, OK? Relax!
That's right, Chief. Howard will be happier if you loosen up a bit.
R-Really? All right, I'll try.
Pleased to meetcha!
Hahaha! He's a funny man, isn't he? You're a real funny guy, Ogami!
Yeah, Chief here's a real riot!
Ever since I came to Japan, I've only traveled between Kyoto and Osaka, so that's why I talk like this!
Which wound up rubbing off on me, too.
Oh, I-I see…
…O-Oh? Was that all you had to say?
You're a lot more reserved than I expected. Japanese people really are a quiet bunch.
Well everyone's quiet compared to you, Howard.
By the way, this is a surprisingly normal house.
I was expecting an extravagant laboratory or something when Kohran said you were her teacher…
Heheheh…
Heheh…
...?
Ogami, could you shut your peepers till I give ya the all-clear? Just close your eyes, please.
Um, sure.
Wh-Why?
Um, sure.
Wh-Why? Is there something here?
Don't worry! There won't be any more explosions or anything!
…Honest?
C'mon, Chief, he's gonna show you something neat, so shut those eyes tight.
But I won't be able to see anything with my eyes closed.
Shush, you. Just do it already.
…Like this?
OK! Kohran, switch on!
All right, here we go!
Wh-What's that? What's going on?
Wait just a bit longer, Chief.
Sorry to keep ya waiting! You can open your eyes now.
Wh-What is this place?
Are you surprised? Shocking, right? This is my research room!
Pops' entire house is rigged with machinery.
Using specially-made elevators, you can move to any room in this house while you're sitting down.
Th-That's amazing!
Couldn't you just walk?
Th-That's amazing! What an incredible machine.
Heheheh, please, keep the praise coming.
But if it's only next door, couldn't you just walk there?
Necessity is the mother of invention, and invention is the cradle of science!
He's right, Chief, and science is a tool to make everyone happy.
…
Heheh, looks like you've still got lots to learn, Ogami.
By the way, Howard, what kinda research have you been up to lately?
Good question! Right now I'm designing an airplane that runs off spirit power!
For real? That's amazing. You have to tell me all about it!
I'm gonna stay here and talk with Howard for a minute. Make yourself at home over there, Chief.
Sheesh, those two really are obsessed with machines.
…
How long are they going to make me wait here, anyway...?
Here we are! This is the Grand Imperial Hotel.
Your parents are meeting up here, right?
That's correct. Now then, Mr. Ensign, let's hurry ourselves up and get inside!
Oh, Orhime! And Ogami! Welcome.
Ciao, Papa!
It's been a while. How are you feeling?
When I heard Carino was coming, my wounds healed in an instant. Hahaha…
…Seiya!
...?!
C-Carino?!
Ah, Seiya…
Carino!
Seiya… At last… <br> At last, we are reunited once more!
Carino… I’m so sorry
I didn’t have the courage to face you… Not after abandoning both you and Orihime…
No, that is a falsehood. I know more than anyone the kind hearted man you truly are. 
You cast yourself into exile for the sake of Orihime… and myself.
…
But no more… I will not let you go a second time.
Even if it means losing everything… I will never let you go ever again!
Carino!
Papa… <br> Mamma…
Orihime…
Say something to them.
Orihime… Let's go congratulate them.
Mr. Ensign… Let's leave them alone for now.
Orihime… Let's not say anything and leave them alone for now.
Yes… I was thinking the same thing.
Papa and Mamma couldn’t meet for over a decade…
But that whole time, they still loved each other.
And now finally, they are together again.
So you must be Ichiro Ogami. I have read much about you in Orihime’s correspondence.
I am her mother, Carino. Allow me to extend my gratitude for all you’ve done for my daughter.
No need to thank me. I only did what I could.
But Orihime’s hatred towards Japanese men was truly unyielding.
How did you succeed in opening her heart to you?
I think it was trust.
I think it was patience.
I think it was love.
I think it was all trust.
Trusting each other, and earning each other's trust in turn…
I think that's how we came to understand one another.
Hmhm, so corny as ever, Mr. Ensign.
I understand completely. My trust in Seiya was what allowed me to endure the wait for this day.
Please, Ogami… Continue believing in Orihime.
I will.
I think it was all patience.
At first, even I didn't think we'd be able to get along.
But I knew the day would come where she'd open up, so I just waited until then.
…That makes me sound like a bad person.
Hmhm, that's not it, Orihime. I understand Ogami’s intentions quite well.
I too waited a long time, just for this day… The day I could see Seiya again.
Orihime… You should be thankful that Ogami waited for you for so long.
Mamma…
I think it was all love.
W-Wait one second, Mr. Ensign! What's this all of the sudden?!
Now, Orihime, expressing one's love is a very important thing.
I think it's praiseworthy that Ogami is able to profess his devotion so openly.
Mamma…
I… don't really know, either.
Hmhm, you're an honest man, Ogami.
I am sure Orihime sensed that honesty as well.
You are the man my daughter chose, after all. There's not a doubt in my mind that you're a wonderful person.
Orihime. You must always treasure Ogami's feelings for you.
Yes, Mamma. I understand.
Now then… <br> Mr. Ensign, could you come with me for a second?
All right, sure.
Where to?
All right, sure.
…Thank you, Mr. Ensign.
Come with you where, exactly?
Whatever, it doesn't matter! Just follow me!
H-Hey, Orihime, you don't need to pull!
Come, Mr. Ensign, quit loafing around and hurry up already.
All right Papa, Mamma, we will be in the lounge upstairs.
Understood.
We'll stay right here, so take your time.
All right, let's go, Mr. Ensign.
I thank you for being so considerate, Mr. Ensign.
I bet Papa and Mamma have all kinds of things they want to talk about.
Jeez, you're so inconsiderate, Mr. Ensign.
Didn't you get a hint that we should leave them alone?
S-Sorry… I didn't notice.
…Mamma mia, some things never change with you.
But still, I had no idea up till now…
No idea that Papa and Mamma loved each other that much…
Orihime…
I really am glad for them.
I'm jealous of them.
I hope we end up like them.
I'm so glad they were finally able to reunite.
Yes! I am so, so very glad for them!
And it's all because you helped patch things up with Papa and me.
Thank you so much, Mr. Ensign!
I'm actually jealous of them. I've never seen such a loving couple before.
Truly, they are. But it's OK, I've already found a partner for myself.
You have? Who is it? Tell me, Orihime.
Heehee, whoever could it be?
I hope… we end up like them.
…Yes. Surely, we will.
Orihime…
All right, Mr. Ensign, until Papa and Mamma's conversation dies down a bit…
Let's stay up here a while, just the two of us.
Yeah, let's.
But at this rate, I don't think they'll be stopping till sunset.
Heeehee, oh, Mr. Ensign, that's perfectly all right.
Huh? Why's that?
Heehee… Because, that means we can be alone together for even longer.
All right, Reni, here we are. This is Meiji Shrine.
…
…Reni? What's wrong?
Torii gates…
…? <br> What about them?
Whenever we battled against the Black Demons…
There were always torii gates where we fought.
I wonder if there's some kind of connection…
Now that you mention it…
You're imagining things.
Now that you mention it, you're right. That's way too many to be a coincidence.
…
Once we get back, let's analyze them with the steam processor.
…Good call.
You're just imagining things, Reni. There just happened to be torii gates at those locations.
After all, the capital's filled with shrines and temples.
Besides, we beat the Black Demons, so there's nothing to be worried about anymore.
…I wonder.
…Really? I don't remember that.
I'll look into it some more once we get back.
Yeah, that might not be a bad idea.
For now, though, let's just enjoy our shrine visit, all right, Reni?
…Yeah, got it.
OK, let's head inside the shrine grounds.
As expected, Meiji Shrine is packed with people going on their first shrine visit of the year.
Captain, what's this arrow?
Hm? Which one?
It's apparently called a… "hamaya."
It's a good luck charm.
It's a weapon.
It's a firework chant.
It's a good luck charm for the New Year. The name "hamaya" means "arrow that destroys evil."
I see…
It's a weapon. It IS an arrow, after all.
But it's covered in so many decorations, it doesn't look very practical.
It's a chant you shout out during fireworks… Just kidding.
Isn't that "tamaya"?
Wow, Reni, you sure know a lot.
I remembered from when we set off fireworks during our summer vacation.
Oh, I-I see…
Hmmm… Sorry, I don't really know, either.
All right, I'll look it up when we get back.
By the way, how are you enjoying your first New Year's shrine visit?
There's so many things I've never seen before, I'm overcome with curiosity.
I see. I'm glad you like it.
Let's go look at some more things, then.
Yeah.
Captain, what is this?
Ah, this is a place that sells fortunes and charms.
…Fortunes?
Um… I guess it's sort of like a horoscope.
Things like "good luck" or "bad luck" will be written on the paper, which tells you your fortune.
Let's give it a shot, Reni. It'll make more sense if you try it yourself.
Sure. In that case…
…
Urgh! I got… "bad luck"...
Even worse, it says: "Beware of drowning"...
So that symbol means unlucky? Then… what does this mean?
Let's see here…
Whoa! You got: "Great luck"! That's the best one!
…Is it, now.
Good for you, Reni!
…Wanna trade?
I can't believe you got "great luck" right away. Good for you, Reni!
And "great luck" is the best one, right?
Yeah. This year's definitely gonna be a good one for you.
There's no harm in believing in it if you got great luck.
Got it. I will, then.
I got bad luck, so I don't really want to believe mine, though. Hahaha…
…
If it's all right with you… How's about a trade?
Sure.<br>Here you go.
K-Kidding, I was just kidding! There's no way I could take that from you!
I don't really mind.
Still, I can't believe I pulled "bad luck" first thing this year…
Captain, it's odd you'd give so much weight to a scrap of paper like this.
Hmmm… It DOES bug me, though.
A person's future is determined by their actions and environment.
A piece of paper like this won't change that.
Reni…
Though reading one's fortune at the start of a new year does have a psychological effect.
What the heck, Reni… You just had to go and say that as I was starting to feel better.
*sigh* Can't believe I got bad luck… Well, after bad luck comes good fortune, though, right? Hahaha.
Sorry Ogami, but customers are only allowed to purchase one of each bromide. 
I see. That's too bad.
