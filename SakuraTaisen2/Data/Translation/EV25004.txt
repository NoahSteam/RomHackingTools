Woman… <br> We acknowledge thee.
Power is everything… <br> Thy power is what we seek.
Come, woman… <br> Come to Shinnou…
You don't get it. It's because of the others that I can fight.
I fight because there are people I love!
Let's go, Ogami! Now's the time to show him what we're really made of!
I refuse to yield to anyone.
I will walk my own path… with the ones I love!
Ensign… <br> Let us dance. <br> A dance… of victory!
I will not falter. <br> I have the Flower Division.
I have people I care about, who are always by my side.
Captain… I believe in you.
You… You've never fought for anyone else, have ya?
It's because I got people I hold dear… That I can fight with unlimited power!
I… have the Boss! <br> We'll never lose to the likes of you!!
I… love my papa! <br> And I love my mama!
I love everyone in the Flower Division! I love everyone in the city! I love Jean-Paul!
And I love Mon Frère most of all! That's why… I fight by everyone's side!
You just don't get it. It's thanks to the others that I can fight.
There's people I care about… And it's thanks to their smiling faces that I can fight!
Let's go, Chief! <br> Time for us to set off some huge fireworks!
Sorry, but there's no way someone like you's got a chance with me!
There's only one gentiluomo who's fit for me…
Mr. Ensign! If you'd be so kind as to escort me!
There was a time when I, too, believed in nothing but power.
But then… Someone risked their own life to save mine.
I fight for them… And I fight for everyone!
You've done well to make it this far… But this is the end for you.
We'll see about that!
