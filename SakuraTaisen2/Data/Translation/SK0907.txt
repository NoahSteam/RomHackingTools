Now then, a toast! To the success of our performance of "The Miracle Bells"! 
Cheers! 
Thank you so much for your hard work, Ogami! 
Thank you. I feel so touched right now... 
Truly, it was a fittingly fabulous production to bring an end to the year. 
And on top of that, it's Reni's birthday today! The good times just keep on rolling! 
OK, everybody, here we go! Reni... 
Happy birthday! 
Thank you, everyone... 
This is the first time I've ever had a party like this. 
And one more thing. On this holy night, to celebrate Christmas... 
Merry Christmas! 
Man, that was a great show! A smash hit! Now for the wrap party! 
I hope you don't mind if we join in. 
Mr. Yoneda, Kaede! Come on in! 
Protecting everyone in the capital may be the Imperial Assault Troupe's job... 
But giving dreams to the people of the capital is the other part of the Flower Division's duties. 
You all did great today. 
Mr. Yoneda... 
At any rate, it's always exciting to be done with a play. 
No matter how exhausted you are, you just can't fall asleep. So party as hard as ya can! 
All right! We'll party straight till mornin’! 
Yeah! 
Phew... I need to sober up a bit. 
That said, I still feel all warm inside. 
We totally connected with the audience... What a great play that was. 
Ogami... 
Great job today, Sakura. That was a wonderful show. 
I'll remember this play for as long as I live. 
Ogami... Thank you for everything. I mean it. 
Sakura... 
Ensign... 
Hey Sumire. Great job today. That was a wonderful show. 
I've been in many plays up until now... 
But there's no play I've ever been happier to be a part of. 
Sumire... 
Captain... 
Hey, Maria. Great job today. That was a wonderful show. 
I was so nervous about playing a female lead... 
But thanks to you, sir, I feel like I've discovered a new side of myself. Thank you. 
Maria... 
...Boss. 
Is that you, Kanna? Great job today. That was a wonderful show. 
I still can't believe I actually played a female lead. 
This... This ain't a dream, right? I can believe in this, right? 
Kanna... 
Ah, Mon Frère! There you are! 
Iris. You did great today. 
I worked hard! Super duper hard! 
All because you cheered me on, Mon Frère! 
Iris... 
Chief... 
Hey, Kohran. Great job today. That was a wonderful show. 
I'm so happy everyone in the crowd liked the play. 
And it's all 'cause you gave me the courage to do it. Thanks a bunch, Chief. 
Kohran... 
Ensign... 
Orihime. Great job today. That was a wonderful show. 
You did great work yourself, Ensign. 
At any rate, that was an excellent play. I bet it'd even be a success in Italy. 
Hahaha... Glad to hear it. 
Captain... 
Hey, Reni. Great job today. That was a wonderful show. 
All that preparation, all that passion, all the affection from the crowd... 
And that brief moment where the god of the stage smiled upon us. It was a miraculous play. 
I want to keep performing plays like that forever. 
Reni... 
Oh, so that's where you two ran off to. 
Ah... Mr. Yoneda? 
What have we here, a Christmas date? Hahaha... Ah, youth is a wonderful thing. 
Well, today's a special day. Just make sure you two get back by midnight. 
Mr. Yoneda... 
If it's all right with you Ogami, maybe we could... step outside for a moment? 
I'd like to take a walk through the capital on Christmas with you. 
All right, sure. It's a Christmas Eve date, then... Until midnight, anyway. 
O-OK! 
Wow... It's snowing! 
You're right. It's piled up quite a bit, too. 
It almost feels like I'm dreaming... 
Like we're still in the middle of the play. 
To think I get to spend Christmas all alone with you... 
Sakura... 
Let's have our one magical hour until midnight, OK, Ogami? 
Seeing as it's Christmas and all, I'd like to visit that chapel over there. 
All right, sure. Let's go. 
I've always wanted to visit a chapel on Christmas. 
It's so quiet. Doesn't sound like anybody's inside. 
Why don't we step in for a bit, Ogami? 
All right, sure, let's drop in. 
Makes sense to visit a church on Christmas, since it's a Western holiday. 
Yes. Christmas is a day full of love. 
And it's a day where we pray to express our gratitude. 
What I'm grateful for is... Your love, Ogami... 
Ah... S-Sorry, I don't know what came over me... 
Sakura... 
Ogami... I... 
... 
Kiss her. 
Sakura... 
Yes... 
Ah! 
I-Is that the bell? 
Ah! 
I-Is that the bell? 
It's 12 o'clock. The magic hour is just about over, huh. 
The magic hour, huh? 
We have to get back to the theater. 
Sakura... 
Ogami... 
Please... Stay with me forever. 
... 
All right. I'll stay by your side. Forever. 
...OK. 
If it's all right with you, Ensign, perhaps we could step outside for a moment? 
I'd like to take a stroll with you in the capital while it's still Christmas. Just the two of us. 
All right, sure. It's a Christmas Eve date, then... Until midnight, anyway. 
Well then, shall we, Sumire? 
Yes. 
My, it's snowing. It feels so good after being on that hot stage. 
You're right. It's piled up quite a bit, too. 
Snowfall on Christmas... 
It's almost as though the snow itself is blessing us. 
The snow's blessing us, huh? 
So much has happened this past year. 
I only barely managed to avoid getting married... 
Yeah, that did happen, huh... 
Back then… I was prepared for the possibility that I'd never step foot in the Imperial Theater again.
That I'd never get to see you again, Ensign... 
But instead, I was able to go on stage as the star of the Christmas play. 
Being with you like this, just the two of us... 
It's quite mysterious, when you think about it. 
Yeah, it is. 
No, it isn't. 
You're right, it's so mysterious. 
I wonder if God is just teasing us... 
No, it's not mysterious at all. 
It's because we followed our hearts that we're both here now. 
It's because we both worked so hard that the snow's blessing us like this. 
Ensign... 
... 
That reminds me, there's a chapel down the way here, isn't there? 
Would you like to stop by, Ensign? 
Yeah, sure. Let's go. 
You're right. I had no idea there was a chapel here. 
Let's go inside, Ensign. 
I was hoping to express my thanks to God for something. 
Oh? Thanks for what? 
Well, you see... 
I wanted to properly express my gratitude that we could be together like this... 
That I could be with you for Christmas. 
Sumire... 
Ensign... 
Captain... There's a chapel a small distance from here. 
If it's all right with you, sir, do you think we could go there together? 
All right, sure. It's a Christmas Eve date, then... Until midnight, anyway. 
Right, then. Let's go, Maria. 
Yes, sir. 
Ah... Captain, look. Snow. 
You're right. It's piled up quite a bit, too. 
I guess snow's not exactly an uncommon occurrence for you, since you were born in Russia. 
Yes. The winters in Russia are long and intense. 
Which is why we have to cherish whatever human contact and warmth we can get. 
We brave the winter, hand in hand... 
And a joyous spring greets us at the end. 
Maria... 
Let's go, Captain. 
You can't have Christmas without going to church at some point. 
Going to church for Christmas, huh? I see. 
Captain, let's offer a prayer. 
Sure... 
What's the right way for me to pray, Maria? 
You don't have to worry about your form, sir. 
It's not how you pray that matters, but rather what you feel. 
(How I feel, huh?) 
(What should I pray for?) 
Give thanks for everything. 
Pray for future happiness. 
(I wish to express my gratitude... For having met everyone in the Imperial Assault Troupe...) 
(And for having met Maria... Thank you.) 
(May everyone in the Imperial Assault Troupe... And Maria...) 
(Live happy, enjoyable lives.) 
... 
All right, Captain, let's go. 
What did you pray for, Maria? 
I gave my thanks for the joy of being alive. 
The joy of... being alive? 
Life is full of pain and sadness. 
Sometimes, you get separated from the people most important to you, forever. 
... 
But... I try to cherish the joy of ever having known them. 
It's because I'm alive that I get to meet so many people. 
I wanted to express my gratitude for that, and my hope that I may continue to live with the others. 
That's what I prayed for. 
Maria... 
Captain, I hope that... For as long as I live... 
For as long as you live... What? 
...No, it's nothing. 
Now then, it's almost midnight. We should head back. 
Wh-What's with you, Maria? You're worrying me... 
Come on now, quit loafing around, or I'm leaving you behind. 
Hey, Boss? Um... If it's cool with you... Wanna head outside? 
There's some stuff I wanna talk to you about, alone. 
All right, sure. It's a Christmas Eve date, then... Until midnight, anyway. 
OK then. Let's go, Kanna. 
Yeah! Thanks, Boss. 
Ah! Boss, look, it's snowin’! 
You're right. When did all this snow pile up, anyway? 
Ahahaha! Snow! Snow! It's snowin’, Boss! 
Right, you're from Okinawa, so you don't get to see snow very often, huh? 
That's right. I can count on one hand the amount of times I've seen snow. 
You think maybe it's snowin’ cause I played the lead tonight? Ahahahaha! 
If that's the case, and we feel like having a snowball fight or something... 
I guess that'd mean it was worth giving you the lead role after all. 
...Now you've done it, Boss. How's about we get this snowball fight underway already?! 
Uh oh, better get outta here before she beats me up! 
Heheh, I'm not lettin' you get away that easily! Wait up, Boss! Hahahaha! 
Oh... I never knew there was a church around here. 
Why don't we step inside, since it's Christmas and all. Might be fun. 
It's quiet. Doesn't sound like anyone's in here. 
We can't make too much noise in a church... 
But still, it's Christmas, we should be celebrating! I almost feel like dancing! 
Typical Kanna... 
... 
Boss... Can I... ask you a question? 
Sure, what is it? 
Why did you pick me for the lead? 
Well, you see... 
You were the best fit. 
I thought it'd be funny. 
I thought you were the best fit out of everyone. 
Thanks, Boss... I'm glad to hear you say that. 
I thought it'd be funny to see you play the lead. 
Psh, I thought as much. 
No particular reason. I picked you cause I wanted to. 
I see. Well, it certainly wasn't boring. 
To be totally honest... I was kinda nervous at first. 
Like, "Can someone like me even play this role?" 
But since you picked me, I decided to trust you. 
And since you picked me, I decided to believe in myself. 
Kanna... 
All right, Boss, let's get outta here. 
Yahoo! 
Hahaha... You're full of energy tonight. 
Yeah! I'm in a great mood right now! 
You picked me for the lead... 
We made the audience super happy... 
I've never felt this ecstatic before in my life! 
Thank you, Boss. I mean it, thanks! 
Kanna... 
Uh oh, it's gonna be past midnight soon! 
OK, race you to the theater, then! 
All right, you're on! Think ya can beat me, Boss? Hahahaha! 
What do you think we should do, Iris? 
Ah! Look, Mon Frère! It's snowing! 
C'mon, let's go outside! Can we, Mon Frère? 
Hahaha, you're right. Sure, let's go. 
Yaaaay! C'mon, let's go, Mon Frère! 
Look, Mon Frère! It's snowing so much! 
You're right. When did all this snow pile up, anyway? 
Heheh! I'll make you a snowman! 
Thanks, Iris. Aren't your hands a little cold, though? 
I'll be OK! Just wait a little bit longer. 
...All done! Here you go, Mon Frère. 
Thanks, Iris. What a cute snowman. 
Heheh! I'll make you an even bigger one tomorrow! 
I know! There's a church a little further down the road. 
C'mon, let's go! We can make it back before midnight. 
Yeah, sure, let's take a look. 
You're right. I never knew there was a church here. 
Let's go inside, Mon Frère! C'mon, hurry! 
Hahaha, you're energetic tonight, Iris. 
It's quiet. Doesn't sound like anyone's inside. 
I'll pray to be a good girl. 
You already are a good girl, Iris. 
Heheh, thank you, Mon Frère. I'll pray for you, then. 
... 
...? <br> What's wrong, Iris? 
I'm still just a kid. I'm not a grown up like the others. 
I can't be your girlfriend... 
And I was too small to play the lead role after all. 
Iris... 
That's not true. 
That might be true. 
Iris... That's not true. 
That might be true, in a sense. 
Mon Frère... 
But that's why I picked you for the lead, Iris. 
You're not wrong, Iris, but you're not right, either. 
Huh? What do you mean, Mon Frère? 
Your positivity, your innocence, your honesty... 
Those are your strong points. Your age doesn't matter. 
That's why I thought you'd be able to convey the purity of the lead role. 
Mon Frère... 
You understand now, Iris? 
Uh-huh! Thanks, Mon Frère! 
I love you! 
I hope I can be with you forever! 
Hahaha, yeah. 
I know! I've got a great idea! 
Since we're in a church, let's get married, right now! 
Huh?! M-Married?! 
I'm... I'm glad you feel that way, Iris, but you're still a little young... 
Huh?! But you just said my age doesn't matter! 
Th-That was for something completely different! 
Marry me, Mon Frère! 
Ah... It's almost midnight, Iris. I'm going back to the theater. 
Ah, he's getting away! Wait, Mon Frèreee! 
Chief... Um... Wanna head outside for a bit? 
There's some stuff I wanted to talk to you about, now that the play's over. 
All right, sure. It's a Christmas Eve date, then... Until midnight, anyway. 
OK, let's go, Kohran. 
For real? Thanks a bunch, Chief. All right, let's go. 
Wow... Look, Chief, snow. 
You're right. When did all this snow pile up, anyway? 
It's so pretty... 
Yeah. It's a White Christmas. 
... 
...Kohran? What's up? 
Spending Christmas alone with you, Chief... 
This is all too good for me. 
Kohran... 
Call it a date if you want, but I can't help but feel I don't meet the bar. 
I know I'm not drop-dead gorgeous like the other girls in the Flower Division... 
That's not true. 
So what if you aren't? 
Kohran... That's not true. 
I'm happy to be with you. I mean it. 
Chief... 
So what if you aren't? 
I like you just the way you are, Kohran. 
Chief... 
Don't worry about all that, Kohran. 
You're you. You don't have to overextend yourself. 
The crowd loved having a lead with glasses, didn't they? 
It's your natural genuineness that I like so much about you. 
Chief... 
You're right. I'm me. No need to overextend myself. 
Being together with you like this... 
I'm allowed to be happy about it in my own way. 
That's right. It's that unique Kohran-ness that makes you special. 
Yeah! Thanks, Chief! 
All right, let's get going! How about we wander around the capital till midnight? 
Sounds good! Let's do that. 
Ah, Chief! Look over there, a chapel! 
You're right... I had no idea there was a chapel around here. 
Looks like fun. Why don't we step inside for a sec? 
Sure, let's go in. 
It's quiet... Doesn't sound like anyone else is here. 
Getting to hear the Christmas bells together with you like this... 
This might be the greatest Christmas I've ever had in my life... 
Kohran... 
Oh yeah, I totally forgot something important, Chief! 
I invented something special to celebrate Christmas with, just for such an occasion! 
Oh? What is it? 
A special firework capable of 16 consecutive bursts! I call it "Mr. Firecracker"! 
M-Mr. Firecracker?! 
All right, here we go! Ready? 
I... knew... this would... happen... 
S-Sorry about that, Chief... Don't have a clue why it blew up like that. 
Hahaha... I'm used to your explosions at this point. 
Like I said before, it's that unique Kohran-ness of yours that makes you special. 
Ahahaha! Was that supposed to be a compliment? Eh, I'll take it! 
Once again, Chief... Merry Christmas. 
Yeah. Merry Christmas, Kohran. 
Why don't we take the opportunity to go outside, Ensign? 
I've been hoping to spend Christmas Eve with you for a long time. 
All right, sure. It's a Christmas Eve date, then... Until midnight, anyway. 
Now that that's decided, let's not waste any time! Come on, hurry! 
H-Hey, you don't have to pull so hard. 
Wow... Look, Ensign, snow! 
You're right. When did all this snow pile up, anyway? 
It's snowing right on Christmas... What good timing! Ottimo tempismo! 
The snow must be giving us its blessing! 
Hahaha, you might be right. 
At any rate, the city lights look so pretty with all this snow. 
When I first came to Japan, Sakura told me something. 
She said that she wanted to be like these city lights, and shine up on stage. 
She wanted to be like a strong, warm light, guiding people's way and protecting the peace. 
At the time, I thought the lights in this city were insignificant. 
But now... I know exactly what she meant. 
I want to keep on shining, with you and everyone else in the Flower Division. 
Orihime... 
We'll be together forever. 
You sure have changed. 
Orihime... We'll be together forever. 
Ensign... 
Boy, Orihime, you sure have changed. 
Sh-Shut up! 
Keep talking like that and I'm leaving you here! 
Hahaha, kidding, kidding. 
But there is one big difference between Sakura and I. 
And what's that? 
That I'm the brightest light there is, of course! 
Hahaha, there's the Orihime I know. 
Heehee! Come on, Ensign, let's get going. 
Oh, I had no idea there was a chapel around here. 
What a pretty Christmas tree... 
Ah, one of the stars fell off! 
Ensign, help me put this star back! 
All right, leave it to me! 
Careful, Orihime... 
Thanks, Ensign. I'll be OK. 
All right, you, back with the rest of your little star friends... 
We should go, Ensign. Let's get back to the others. 
You're right, it's almost midnight. 
Ensign... 
What is it? 
One last time... Merry Christmas. 
Yeah. Merry Christmas. 
What should we do, Reni? 
I'd... like to go outside for a while. 
I'm still not used to so much noise. I'd like to go somewhere quiet. 
I see. All right, let's go have a walk outside, then. 
...OK. 
Ah... Snow. 
You're right. When did all this snow pile up, anyway? 
That reminds me, Reni, it was your birthday today, right? How old are you now? 
I'm 16. 
I see. Well, once again, Happy Birthday. 
I always thought birthdays were nothing more than a reference point for measuring one's growth. 
I thought there was no point in celebrating the day you were born. 
But now... Things are different. It's because I was born that I was able to meet you all. 
Birthdays let me know that I'm not alone. 
Reni... 
Oh, I had no idea there was a chapel around here. 
Why don't we offer a prayer while we're here? 
But... I've never prayed before. 
Don't worry, it's nothing to stress over. Come on, let's go inside. 
What should I do, Captain? 
Just think really hard about what you feel in your heart. 
Like what? 
Like what? Well... 
How about making a wish? 
How about giving thanks? 
How about making a wish? Think really hard about your hopes so that they might come true. 
...OK, I get it. 
In that case... I'd like to stay at the theater with everyone forever. 
With you... forever. 
Reni... 
How about giving thanks for something that made you happy? 
Got it. I'll give it a try. 
I'm glad to have met everyone at the theater. 
I'm glad to have met the captain. Thank you. 
Reni... 
Was that good enough, sir? 
Yeah. That was great, Reni. 
Oh, it's almost midnight. 
Let's go home, Reni. To the theater, where everyone's waiting for us. 
...OK. 
Sorry, Ogami. I can only sell you one photo per month. 
I see. That's too bad. 
So sorry, Mr. Ogami, but each customer is only allowed to purchase one photo at a time.
Oh, really? That's too bad.
