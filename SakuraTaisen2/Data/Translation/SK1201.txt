We've made it quite far inside, Captain. 
Yeah. We're definitely getting closer to Musashi's core, little by little. 
...! 
What's wrong, Sakura? 
This presence... 
It's... my father... 
What?! 
So you've arrived. 
I cannot allow you to go any further. 
Demon King! 
Father... 
If you want to pass through here, you'll have to defeat me first. 
Wait! 
Father... It's me! <br> It's Sakura! 
... 
Father! <br> Why are you doing this?! 
The father I knew fought evil at the expense of his own life… So why?!
...Is that all you have to say? 
Father?! 
Protecting Lord Kyogoku is my sworn duty... 
I fight to realize his ideals…
If anyone dares to get in his way… I will strike them down!
Colonel Shinguji... 
Open your eyes!
We have to fight him…
Colonel Shinguji, please, open your eyes!
Have you forgotten about Sakura... Your own daughter?! 
If you won't come to me... Then I shall take the fight to you.
Colonel Shinguji... 
That man... A powerful spell has taken over his mind. 
You'd need an even greater power to break what’s controlling him. 
But we don't have the time to figure that out right now. We have no choice but to fight. 
Urgh... Damn it! 
Sakura... We have no choice but to fight him. 
Ogami?! 
Colonel Shinguji... A powerful spell has taken over his mind. 
But we don't have time to figure out how to break it. All we can do for now is fight. 
That man... A powerful spell has taken over his mind. 
You'd need an even greater power to break what’s controlling him. 
In order to do that... We have no choice but to fight him. 
Urgh... Damn it! 
Father... 
... 
Father... <br> I'll do it... I'll fight you. 
And... I will defeat you! 
Sakura... 
All right, let's go, everyone! 
Sorry Ogami, but customers are only allowed to purchase one of each bromide. 
I see. That's too bad. 
So sorry, Mr. Ogami, but customers are only allowed to purchase one of each bromide.
