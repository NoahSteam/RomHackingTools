We've made it quite far inside, Captain. 
Yeah. We're definitely getting closer to Musashi's core, little by little. 
...! 
What's wrong, Sakura? 
This presence... 
It's... my father... 
What?! 
So you've arrived. 
I cannot allow you to go any further. 
Demon King! 
Father... 
If you want to pass through here, you'll have to defeat me first. 
Wait! 
Father... It's me! <br> It's Sakura! 
... 
Father! Why are you doing this?! 
The father I knew went so far as to sacrifice his own life to fight evil... So why?! 
...Is that all you have to say? 
Father?! 
Protecting Lord Kyogoku is my sworn duty... 
I fight to realize Lord Kyogoku's ideals... 
I will strike down anyone who dares get in his way! 
Colonel Shinguji... 
Wake up! 
We have no choice but to fight. 
Colonel Shinguji, please, wake up! 
Have you forgotten about Sakura... Your own daughter?! 
If you won't come to me... Then I'll come to you. 
Colonel Shinguji... 
That man... A powerful spell has taken over his mind. 
You'd need an even greater power to break the spell controlling him. 
But we don't have the time to figure that out right now. We have no choice but to fight. 
Urgh... Damn it! 
Sakura... We have no choice but to fight him. 
Ogami?! 
Colonel Shinguji... A powerful spell has taken over his mind. 
But we don't have time to figure out how to break it. All we can do for now is fight! 
That man... A powerful spell has taken over his mind. 
You'd need an even greater power to break the spell controlling him. 
In order to do that... We have no choice but to fight him. 
Urgh... Damn it! 
Father... 
... 
Father... I'll do it... I'll fight you. 
And... I will defeat you! 
Sakura... 
All right, let's go, everyone!
