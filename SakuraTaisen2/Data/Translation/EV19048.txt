Captain… <br> Why did you ask me to accompany you?
Well…
Because you calm me down.
You're great at combats.
Because… I feel so much calmer during combat when I’m with you, Reni.
That's why, I need you to always be with me.
Captain…
Me too. If I'm with you, I can tell that my capabilities improve.
Even though I don't understand why that happens…
…We better go, Captain. There's no time to dwell on this further.
Yeah. Let's go, Reni!
It's obvious. Because you're so great at combat, better than everyone else.
With a team this small, it's really reassuring to have someone like you fight alongside us.
Understood. I'll make sure that we can achieve your objective.
Yeah. I'm counting on you, Reni.
Because you're important to me. Is that a good enough reason?
Yes. I can understand your intention. A good leader must be able to make reasonable assessments.
I'm ready to engage in combat. I'll make sure that we can achieve your objective.
Yeah. I'm counting on you, Reni.
