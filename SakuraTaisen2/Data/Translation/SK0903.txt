It's Ogami. Are you there, Kaede? 
Come in. The door's open. 
Kaede, what did you want to discuss with me? 
You know about the Flower Division's Christmas performance, right? "The Miracle Bells"? 
Yes. At least, I know it’s a special one-night event being held on Christmas Eve.
The thing is… I received a request from everyone in the division.
They want you to pick which member will play the starring role for the performance.
What?! They want ME to choose?!
Right now, we have four candidates for the main lead.
Sakura... 
Sumire... 
Maria... 
Kanna... 
Iris... 
Kohran... 
Orihime... 
Reni... 
...Those four.
...Are you up to the task, Ogami?
Yes, ma’am, understood…
I... I can't do it.
Yes, ma’am, understand… I’ll do the best I can…
Well said, Ogami. 
I... I can't do it. I’m just an amateur… I don’t know anything about theater.
It'll be fine. 
You just need to choose based on your true feelings. That’s what everyone told me as well. 
I see... 
... 
I know this isn’t going to be easy, but please, Ogami…
Everyone in the Flower Division trusts you deeply.
No matter what you decide, I hope you’ll prove yourself worthy of that trust, in your own way.
Let me know your answer tomorrow. As for today, take your time to carefully consider your choice.
...I understand. 
Do your best, Ogami. I'm counting on you. 
I’m picking the star, huh? Hmm… Now that I think about it, that’s a huge responsibility.
These chimes… I guess it’s 5 o’clock.
Oh, that reminds me! I was supposed to help someone at 5 o’clock…
Kasumi is sorting receipts, Yuri is hanging up posters, and Tsubaki needs help with the gift shop…
Uh… Who should I go help?
Go help Kasumi. 
Go help Yuri. 
Go help Tsubaki. 
OK, I'll go to the secretarial office to help Kasumi. 
OK, I'll go to the VIP entrance to help Yuri. 
OK, I'll go to the gift shop to help Tsubaki. 
Hi, Kasumi. I'm here to help. 
Ogami... Thank you very much. 
Well, let's begin sorting these receipts right away.
All right, will do.
Good work, Ogami. You were a big help.
... 
Ogami? 
...Oh, sorry. I just have something on my mind. 
... 
...Ogami, do you have some free time right now?
Yeah, I'm not busy. 
Let’s get something to eat, then. I know this place called Renga-Tei, the food there is delicious.
It’s the least I could do to thank you. Besides, you seem really concerned about something.
Huh? W-Wait... 
I’m going to get changed so please wait a moment.
H-Hey, Kasumi! 
...So that's how it is. Choosing the main lead is indeed a big responsibility.
I’m sorry, you went to the trouble of inviting me out and I’m just talking about my worries.
No, it's fine. After all, you're always helping us out.
So, every once and a while, I want to be the one lending you a hand instead.
By the way, what is it that worries you the most about this decision, Ogami?
Well, you see... 
I don't know who to choose. 
I worry about the others... 
Who should I choose? Who would be the best fit for the part? I just don’t know…
You’ve always been a very earnest person, Ogami. No wonder you’re having a hard time.
I’m worried that the others will feel bad about not getting chosen… I just can’t do it.
...I thought so. You’re a very kind-hearted person, Ogami.
I don’t really know why I’m so worried, myself…
That’s understandable. You were given this responsibility so suddenly, after all.
Well… I believe you should pick whoever it is you like the most. I think that would be best.
I'm sure your feelings will get through to her. That's what makes for a good play. 
Kasumi... 
There'll be some disagreement no matter who you choose. 
But nobody will blame you. They all trust you.
You're right. If no one's picked to be the lead, then the play can't happen. 
Thanks for your advice, Kasumi. 
Oh, it was nothing. I’m just glad I could help.
Well now, Ogami. I hope you can continue to keep me company for today. 
Let’s take our time and enjoy Renga-Tei’s delicious food.
Hi, Yuri. I'm here to help. 
Ah, Ogami! So you came after all. Thank you!
OK, let’s get right to it and start changing these posters!
Right, on it.
Thanks a lot, Ogami! You really saved my bacon.
... 
Ogami? Is something the matter? 
...Oh, sorry. I just have something on my mind. 
Very suspicious… You're not hiding something from me, are you?
N-No... That's not... 
I know! Mind going somewhere with me, Ogami?
Huh? Go where? 
There’s a western-style restaurant I often go to with the others called Renga-Tei.
I’ll take you there as a treat for helping me earlier, plus I’m curious about your little secret…
Let's go, Ogami! 
Huh?! H-Hold on a minute, Yuri. 
Come on, it’ll be fun. Wait a minute while I go change my clothes!
H-Hey, Yuri! 
Uh-huh, I see. So you have to choose the lead actress. 
Yeah, that’s right. I’ve got a lot on my mind right now.
Deciding who will play the main character is definitely a heavy responsibility.
But what exactly is bothering you the most?
Well, you see... 
I don't know who to choose. 
I worry about the others... 
Who should I choose? Who would be the best fit for the part? I just don’t know…
You're being as indecisive as ever. 
I’m worried that the others will feel bad about not getting chosen… I just can’t do it.
You're being too nice, you know? 
I don’t really know why I’m so worried, myself…
You're being as carefree as ever. 
Just go for it and pick whoever you like the most.
If your feelings get through to her… I'm sure she'll make this show the best it can be.
Hmm... 
Of course, the people that aren’t selected will feel bad…
But if you worry about that too much, nothing will get done. The show must go on!
Right, I can’t just mope around forever.
Thanks for the advice, Yuri. 
Don’t sweat it. After all, you gave me some juicy info for future gossip.
OK, since we’re already here, let’s enjoy our food, Ogami.
It wouldn't be so bad to have a date with you just this once, right?
Hi, Tsubaki. I'm here to help. 
Oh, Ogami! So you came after all. Thank you so much!
OK, let’s get started right away. Can you help me arrange the merchandise?
Yeah, I’ll get started.
Thanks a lot, Ogami. You were a big help.
... 
Ogami? Is something wrong? 
...Oh, sorry. I just have something on my mind. 
... 
I know, Ogami! You want to go somewhere with me?
Huh? Go where? 
To a restaurant called Renga-Tei! I've been meaning to take you there.
Their omelettes are really delicious! Well, what do you say?
Oh, OK... 
Ogami… Something’s troubling you, isn’t it? I want you to tell me all about it.
I’m going to get changed. Please wait a second!
H-Hey, Tsubaki! 
So that’s what’s going on… You have to choose the star for the Christmas performance.
Yeah, that's right. 
Wow! Isn’t it amazing that you get to be more involved with the play?
So, what are you worried about?
... 
I don't know who to choose. 
I worry about the others... 
Who should I choose? Who would be the best fit for the part? I just don’t know…
I see… It is a difficult decision, isn’t it?
I’m worried that the others will feel bad about not getting chosen… I just can’t do it.
You're right... The ones who aren’t picked might feel sad... 
I don’t really know why I’m so worried, myself…
Yeah… I think I know how you feel…
... 
Um, Ogami… It may sound cheeky of me to say this, but…
I think that… you should just choose the person you like the most. 
I’m sure that everyone else in the Flower Division feels the same way.
Hmm... 
You're always worried about everyone, Ogami. Have some faith in yourself. 
Right, I can’t just mope around forever.
Thanks for your advice, Tsubaki. 
Sorry if I sounded a bit presumptuous…
Tee-hee! Well, Ogami, let's eat! 
I've always wanted to bring you here, even if it was just once. Now my dream has finally come true!
Sorry, Ogami. I can only sell you one photo per month. 
I see. That's too bad. 
So sorry, Mr. Ogami, but each customer is only allowed to purchase one photo at a time.
Oh, really? That's too bad.
