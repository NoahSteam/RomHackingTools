Mr. Ensiiign! You made an excellent choice by picking me as your partner!
So, what are your expectations for me in battle?
Well…
I want you to charge ahead.
I want you to support us.
I want you to charge ahead, leading the others on the front line.
After all, your fighting brilliance truly shines when you take center stage.
Hehe! You understand my fighting style perfectly. Way to go, Mr. Ensign!
I'll leave the detailed tactics up to you. Now, let's do this!
OK. I'm counting on you, Orihime.
I was hoping you could support us from the rear. I don't want to put you in danger, Orihime.
Understood. But, I'm rather worried about you, Mr. Ensign.
Don't push yourself too far, OK?
Yeah. Thanks, Orihime.
Let’s see… I’m not sure. I didn’t have anything specific in mind, I just wanted to pick you.
So… I didn’t have any real reason. Is that a bad thing…?
Not at all. For some reason, that makes me really happy.
Let's do our best, Mr. Ensign!
Yeah, let's do this.
