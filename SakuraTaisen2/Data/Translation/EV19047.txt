Mr. Ensiiign! An excellent choice you have made, picking me as your partner!
So, what do you expect of me in this battle?
Ah…
I want you to charge ahead.
I want you to support us.
I want you to charge ahead, leading the others on the front line.
After all, your fighting brilliance truly shines when you take center stage.
Heheh! How well you understand my style of fighting! I knew you would.
The detailed tactics I will leave to you. Now, let us do this!
OK. I'm counting on you, Orihime.
I was hoping you could support us from the rear. <br> I don't want to put you in danger, Orihime.
Understood. But, I am rather worried about you, Mr. Ensign.
Do not push yourself too far, OK?
Oh, thanks, Orihime.
What do I expect? I'm not sure. I didn't have anything in mind, I just wanted to pick you.
So… I suppose I don't have any specific expectations. Is that a bad thing?
Not at all. That actually makes me quite happy.
Let us do our best, <br> Mr. Ensign!
Yeah, let's do this.
