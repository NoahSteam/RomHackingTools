Mr. Ensign?! I have something I must tell you!
Wh-What is it, Orihime?
I'm so very sorry for everything!
I have been simply wretched to you!
Ah, so that's what it was…
I don't mind at all.
You tore me to shreds.
It actually felt nice.
I don't mind at all.
Do you mean that? Why Mr. Ensign, how kind you are… Truly, I see you in a new light.
Hahaha. Quite the smooth talker, aren't you?
Those harsh words of yours tore my heart to shreds…
Mr. Ensign… Please do forgive me…
Well then, allow me to heal your shredded heart with my words of kindness.
N-No, that's all right… It might just get shredded into even smaller pieces.
It actually felt nice. I could feel something well up inside me at every nasty word you sent my way…
Listen to you, telling such jokes to make me feel better… You are truly wonderful.
But I meant it…
…Heheheh.
Why do you laugh now, so suddenly?
Does that laugh mean that I am forgiven? I knew that you would, Mr. Ensign.
No, it's just… When I remember the things you've said to me up till now, I start to tear up…
But I truly am sorry! I will try my best never to say another horrible thing to you.
I'm glad to hear it, but you're fine just the way you are.
Eh? What makes you say that?!
To me, the most wonderful thing about you is your free spirit, how you shine like the sun itself.
If you spend too much time worrying over me, it might dampen that wonderful part of you.
Mr. Ensign… My heart swells with gladness. You have moved me deeply!
In that case, I will continue to speak just as freely to you as I always have.
Hahaha… Just try not to overdo it.
