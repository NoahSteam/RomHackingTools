Kyogoku…! <br> But first things first, we have to destroy these pillars!
Yes. I can feel it, Ogami. <br> Wicked energy is flowing through the eight pillars around us.
Those columns are glowing red… Energy appears to be concentrating at those points.
But when the pillars are full of energy like that, they're basically powder kegs ready to go off. 
Taking them out will be a piece of cake as long as we attack the columnss at that exact moment!
I see. So we should be able to make quick work of these pillars once they’re full of energy.
