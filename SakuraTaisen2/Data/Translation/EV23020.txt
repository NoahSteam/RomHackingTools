Kyogoku…! <br> But first things first, we have to destroy these pillars!
Yes. I can feel it, Ogami. <br> Wicked energy is flowing through the eight pillars around us.
That pillar's glowing red… It seems the energy's concentrated there.
But when they're full of energy like that, that just means they're like powder kegs ready to go off.
If we aim for that exact moment, taking them out will be a piece of cake!
I see. So it ought to be faster to destroy them when they're full of energy, then.
