Yesterday sure was crazy, but it was a fun summer trip nonetheless. 
Well, I suppose a plebeian vacation like this isn't so bad every now and then. 
By the way, Chief, what were you up to while we were at the beach? 
Yeah, I wanted to play with you, Mon Frère! 
Hahaha, sorry, sorry. I was busy with something. 
Speaking of which, Maria wasn't there either. 
Yeah, Maria, where the hell were ya?! 
I was also busy. Sorry I couldn't join you all. 
You're so weird, Maria. We came all this way and you didn't swim even once! 
… 
Hmhmhm… 
Hahahaha! 
W-What’s up with the sudden laughter? You're creepin' me out!
S-Sorry, it's nothing. 
All right, everyone, let's go home. 
Full steam ahead to the Imperial Theater! 
Sorry Ogami, but customers are only allowed to purchase one of each bromide. 
I see. That's too bad. 
So sorry, Mr. Ogami, but customers are only allowed to purchase one of each bromide.
Oh, really? That's too bad.
