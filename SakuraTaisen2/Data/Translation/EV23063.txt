Hey Maria, the two of us together like this, reminds you of old times, huh?
Yes… It was right after the troupe was formed. We were still short on personnel then.
Yep. We didn't even have the boss around yet.
It was just you and me at first… Then later Iris…
Then it was Kohran, Sakura… Then the captain, Orihime, Reni…
When you stop and think about it, the division has fought so many battles to get to this point.
Yep, and this one's a battle we can't afford to lose.
Let's do this, Maria!
Yes! Let's do our best, Kanna!
