Huh?! Musashi... <br> It suddenly started moving! 
It's leaving the capital's airspace. It's headed towards the Pacific Ocean! 
What on earth is going on? 
Musashi needs to absorb city energy, so for it to fly away from the capital is... most strange. 
Could it be? Did Ichiro and the others pull it off? 
In that case... Musashi has... 
Exactly… <br>That very well may be the case. 
Yes. There's the possibility that it has lost control. 
It appears that Ogami and the others have finally arrived at Musashi's core. 
At long last, we’ve reached the grand finale, eh?
OK! Mikasa, pursue the Musashi!
We have to be ready to come in for the rescue at a moment’s notice!
Roger! 
Don't you die on me, Ogami. 
I'm getting a strong spirit energy reading up ahead. 
Something's here... 
…Let's go, everyone! 
Yes, sir! 
...?! <br> What the hell is this place? 
Heheheh... <br> You've come at last, Assault Troupe. 
Kyogoku! 
Kyogoku?! Show yourself!! 
I'm right here, maggots! 
Whoa! 
Wh-What a huge Hex Mech! 
Witness the guardian of Musashi, the throne of the Imperial Gods: Shinnou! Ahahahahaha! 
Shinnou... 
With Shinnou under my control, I'll kill every last one of you! You'll die for my ideals! 
You could never hope to understand... MY IDEALS! 
I don't want to hear it! 
Your... ideals? 
I don't want to hear it! I don't give a damn about your ideals! 
You've lost control over Musashi! Prepare yourself, Kyogoku! 
I'll admit, I underestimated you worms. 
But I won't simply die here! I'll drag you all to hell with me! 
I'll admit, I underestimated you worms. 
But I won't simply die here! I'll drag you all to hell with me! 
Your... ideals?! 
You wish to know? Very well, then. I'll tell you. 
My dream... is to build a true capital on this land! 
A... true capital? 
How will you do that? 
A... true capital? What are you talking about?! 
The true capital... A world where man and demon can coexist... 
Wh... What?! 
A true capital? How do you plan to build such a thing? 
Not building; purifying! 
Everything can only begin once I've purified the capital... By destroying it! 
Wh... What?! 
Hahaha! I don't expect a lowly worm like you to understand! 
Deep below the capital... <br> There rest the vengeful spirits we call "Kouma." 
Humans took the power of these spirits, calling it "city energy,” and used it to establish their capital! 
Nobody can claim such a place isn't inherently tainted! 
I have no need for this tainted city! The capital must be cleansed, destroyed by my hand! 
Destroyed by my hand, <br> reborn by my hand, <br> and ruled by my hand! 
THAT is my true capital! 
Open your eyes to the truth, Ichiro Ogami! This city must be purged! 
You're wrong! 
A true... capital... 
You're wrong! 
I won't let anyone rob the futures of the people! 
Ogami's right! 
A true... capital... 
Don't let him fool you, Ogami! 
We can't let anyone rob everybody's future! 
... 
Don't let him fool you, Ogami! 
We can't let anyone rob everybody's future! 
But doesn't Musashi also require city energy to function? 
You just came up with whatever excuse was the most convenient for you! 
Heh... I don't expect the likes of you to understand the truth. 
It was a mistake to allow you maggots to get this far. 
But I won't simply die here! I'll drag you all to hell with me! 
Sorry, Ogami. I can only sell you one bromide per month. 
I see. That's too bad. 
So sorry, Mr. Ogami, but each customer is only allowed to purchase one bromide at a time.  
Oh, really? That's too bad.
