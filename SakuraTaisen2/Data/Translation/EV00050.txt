It's been a while since we've fought side-by-side like this, Ogami.
Now that you mention it, you're right. Since I met you, it's been…
…about one year.
…about two years.
…about 20 years?
…about one year.
What are you talking about, Ogami?!
We've known each other for two years now!
I-It's been that long already? Yeah, I guess it really has…
…about two years.
Yes. Back then, you didn't even know I was a member of the Flower Division…
Yeah. I guess that's how it started…
But it's a nice memory, now.
…about 20 years?
What on earth are you saying? 20 years, honestly!
I hadn't even been born that far back!
S-Sorry. Just thought I'd try to lighten the mood a bit…
…
…Why did you get so quiet all of a sudden?
Uh, sorry. I suddenly got caught up in memories of our time together…
Jeez… It kind of spooked me when you didn't answer.
Sorry, sorry…
Heheh… Well, it's nice to see that you haven't changed at all, Ogami.
I'm glad to fight by your side once more. Let's give it our best!
