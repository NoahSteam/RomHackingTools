Hey, Sakura. Chief must be pretty antsy seeing us together like this. 
...Huh? Why? 
Haha, isn't it obvious why? Because of what happened in Fukagawa. 
Heehee, that's right! When we snuck into that restaurant dressed up as geisha. 
But we were fighting to set things right back then, just like we are right now. 
Now's our chance to show everyone what we've got! Let's do this, Sakura! 
You're right! Let's do our best, Kohran.
