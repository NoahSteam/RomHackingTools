Captain… You put yourself at risk to rescue me. I…
Hm? What is it, Reni?
I'm sorry. You were injured because of me, weren't you…?
I'm completely fine.
It was pretty painful.
I'm completely fine. I keep my body in tip-top condition, so I'm still fit to fight.
I see… What a relief.
It was pretty painful. You really pack a punch.
Heheh… If you're able to joke around, you must be all right.
Are you all right? Were you injured at all? Are you in pain?
Ah, sorry. I was just giving myself a once-over, but I'm perfectly fine.
Jeez, don't frighten me like that…
I'm so glad… that you weren't hurt…
Don't worry about it at all, Reni. If a couple of knocks was all it took to get you back to normal, it was worth it.
U-Um, since you saved me back there, I just… I wanted to say…
…? <br> What is it?
Th… Thank you.
Huh? Did you say something just now?
N-No, never mind! I must return to the battle.
