Mon Frère… Do you think my letter will get delivered? 
Of course it will, Iris.
You put your heart into it.
My feelings are in it.
You wrote that letter with all your heart…
I'm sure it'll reach your parents.
Yeah.
Because that letter is filled with my feelings… My feelings for you…
Mon Frère…
As long as Manager Yoneda doesn’t drop it on the way, I'm sure it'll reach your parents.
Yeah, you're right!
Now, let's finish this battle quickly so your papa and mama won’t need to worry.
Yeah. It'll be OK. I have you… and everyone with me!
