Ogami, if you approach the others in your Tenbu, you'll be able to break them out.
It'll be tough with the two of you surrounded like this. You could split up to rescue the others quickly…
Or you could stick together to proceed with caution. <br> I'll leave that decision up to you.
Still, be careful. Rescuing the others is obviously important…
But eliminating all the hostiles is your top priority.
So try not to get too distracted while rescuing the others, OK?
