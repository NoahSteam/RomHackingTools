I see you have finally arrived… Five Elements of the Black Demon Society… 
Are you out of your damn mind, Demon King?! 
If we've got time to meet up like this, we ought to be out there disposing of those fools! 
What a shameful display, Kongou. You've already lost once, so hold your tongue! 
Tch!! 
Fwohoho… <br> Harsh as ever you are, Tsuchigumo… 
Still, that loss will by no means be in vain. All is within my calculations. 
Who cares about wins or losses, how we kill them is the real issue at hand. 
How fares Suiko? 
She has already taken up her post. And quite gracefully, I might add. 
I see… 
Now, as to the reason I have gathered you all here today… 
Through our master's influence, the troupe's financial backers have withdrawn their support. 
Hm, attacking the enemy's supply lines. A fitting way to dispose of the trash, wouldn't you say? 
Hah! What a cheap trick. How dull. 
Yet there are still those who would give them funding. 
Fwohoho… <br> Even so, all remains within my calculations. 
All we need do is cut things off at the source. Do you not agree, Demon King? 
We must bring them down. 
Leave this task to me! 
Hmph! Your Dainichiken isn't even finished with repairs yet. 
Allow me to handle this one, as only I can. 
I'm fed up with chasing prey that runs away. The hunt is far more fun if the game fights back!
Very well… <br> Go now, Tsuchigumo. 
Hey! The repairs for my Dainichiken are almost done, let me at 'em! 
Stand down, Kongou. 
Grr… Tch! 
Tsuchigumo, do not betray his expectations… 
Phew… <br> Let's take five, everyone. 
We've been rehearsing nonstop since this morning. Prolly good to rest for a bit. 
Yes, you're right. Why don't we have some tea while we're at it? 
… 
What's up, Boss? You're lookin' a bit gloomy. 
(I wonder if I should tell the others about Sumire's call. Or…) 
Tell them about the call. 
Change the subject. 
Tell them about the call. 
To tell the truth, I got a call from Sumire last night. 
Huh! What'd she wanna talk about? 
Well, I'm not too sure. 
She asked what I thought was more important, her or the troupe, and then suddenly hung up. 
Hmmm, that's disturbin’. 
Oh, Mr. Ensign! You are a man without a shred of tact within you! 
…I was thinking the same thing. 
I'm sure that was a conversation Sumire only wanted to have with you. 
Sharing it with the rest of us… That was over the line. 
I-I see… Sorry. 
I-It's nothing. I just had something on my mind, that's all. 
More importantly, your performance of King Lear is shaping up nicely, Kanna! I'm really impressed. 
O-Oh yeah? Aww, c'mon, you're gonna make me blush! 
(Phew, I think I managed to dodge the question.) 
(I think I should keep quiet about what happened last night.) 
…What's up, Boss? 
Sorry, it's nothing. 
Sheesh, you were quiet for a long time before answerin' the question. 
All right, now that we've had a bit of a break, let's get back into it. 
Right. <br> Why don't we continue on with the second half of… 
Ogamiii! <br> I've got some big news! <br> This is serious!! 
Yuri? <br> What kind of big news? 
Don't tell me some other horrible incident has happened… 
Well, I don't know whether it's good news or bad news. 
I only heard about it a moment ago… 
Apparently, Sumire is… getting married!! 
Huh?! 
Wh-What the hell?! 
Her suitor is the son of Viscount Makibishi. 
Apparently, if Sumire marries him, the Kanzaki Group will restore funding to the troupe. 
I see now… <br> That must be why she made that call yesterday!
She called yesterday? 
I got a call from Sumire last night. 
She didn't say anything specific, but she seemed… off. 
Sumire… 
Damn it, what a load of crap! 
That dumbass… Sumire must be plannin' to give herself up to save the troupe. 
Boss, what should we do? 
Let's go rescue her! 
Let's go congratulate her! 
Isn't it obvious? We have to go rescue Sumire! 
If she's being married against her will, we've got to put a stop to it! 
Now that's what I'm talkin' about! 
I'll come as well! 
Poor Sumire! <br> I wanna go save her, too! 
No doubt this will be interesting. You may count me in! 
At the very least, it would be best not to let her be married off to some Japanese man. 
You should come too, Reni! 
I will go if ordered to. 
If we retrieve her, it will strengthen the Flower Division's fighting capabilities. 
OK, everyone! We're off to the Kanzaki estate! 
All right! Heheh, I'm itchin' to get started! 
This is great news! <br> We should go congratulate Sumire, everyone! 
What the hell're you sayin' Boss?! 
That isn't funny, Mon Frère! 
Do you have any idea at all how Sumire must feel, Ogami?! 
Come now, Sakura. You must know that all Japanese men are this way deep down. 
We gotta go rescue Sumire, you guys. And then there's somethin' we gotta tell her: 
That we’re gonna protect the troupe with our own strength!
OK, time for our assault on the Kanzaki estate! Better not dawdle, Boss, or we'll leave ya behind! 
Uh… W-Wait a sec! 
… 
Boss, with things bein' how they are, I get you wantin' to be careful. 
We don't know for sure whether gettin' married is really what Sumire wants. 
But there's one thing I am sure of: there's no way her heart's in this! 
If she was excited about gettin' hitched, you know she'd be over here braggin' about it to us! 
You're right… 
We gotta go rescue Sumire, Boss. And then there's somethin' we gotta tell her: 
That we’re gonna protect the troupe with our own strength! 
All right. Everyone, let's head for the Kanzaki estate! 
All right! Heheh, I'm itchin' to get started. 
… 
…Yes. 
My lady, Lord Makibishi has arrived. 
He as well as Lord Shigeki and Lady Hinako have been waiting for you in the banquet hall for some time. 
Very well. Please tell them… I will be along shortly. 
As you wish. 
…Miyata, what are your feelings on this marriage interview? 
The only wish I have is for your happiness, Lady Sumire. 
I would ask that you cease that dangerous line of work. 
That way, you may seek your own happiness. 
… 
Now then, if you would please excuse me. 
… 
Ensign… 
So this is Sumire's family home, the Kanzaki estate. 
Goodness, this is an enormous house. 
Tch. Figures the gate would be shut. 
Hmm, all right… 
Call for someone. 
Force it open. 
Come back later. 
Excuse me! Is anyone there? 
O-Ogami, just what are you trying to do? 
Unnf… <br> Yeah, this isn't opening. 
Hm, I guess there's nothing we can do. Let's come back later. 
What the hell are you talking about?! 
Sumire might be gettin' married off while we're standin' around here! 
So you've come after all, esteemed members of the Imperial Assault Troupe. 
…! 
Do pardon me for speaking with you through the gate. I am Kyosei Miyata, butler to the Kanzaki household. 
Open up the gate, mister! Me and my friends wanna go see Sumire! 
A thousand pardons, but I'm afraid I must refuse your request to meet with Lady Sumire. 
Today is of momentous importance to Lady Sumire. Therefore, I cannot allow any interruptions to occur! 
If you are so insistent upon meeting with her, why not break through this gate and stroll on inside? 
Heh! You're gonna regret those words, gramps! 
(Is she… planning to break down the gate?) 
Stop her. 
Spur her on. 
Kanna, violence is not the answer here! 
We came here to bring Sumire back, that's all. 
If we destroyed the gate, it would cause a lot more trouble than we bargained for. 
That's easy enough to say, but then how're we supposed to get this gate open? 
Hmm… 
…! <br> W-What the?! 
The gate, it opened! 
Mon Frère, let's go inside! 
Wait. It could be a trap. 
Wh-What? Why has the gate been opened?! 
If the butler’s acting that way, then it probably isn't a trap. 
All right, guys! Time to storm the Kanzaki estate! 
How did the gate open from the inside? 
“If you wait long enough, the weather will be clear enough to go by sea!" Isn't that what they say, Ogami? 
K-Kayama! Why in the world are you here?! 
But of course, in the literal sense it means that good things come to those who wait. 
I myself am as the sun, shining upon the ocean blue! Hahahaha! 
K-Kayama… 
Go on now, Ogami. <br> Sumire is awaiting you. 
And now, I shall fly away with the early summer's breeze. Farewell to you, Ogami! 
Kayama… What the heck is with that guy? 
Boss, hurry up and let's go in! 
Right. Now's not the time for that. We've got to hurry! 
Desperate times call for desperate measures. Kanna, break this thing down! 
Leave it to me! 
One strike's all it'll take. Lemme show you the results of my trainin’! 
Hrrraaahhhhh! 
There we go! 
W-Whoa… 
Un… Unbelievable! The Kanzaki estate's front gate, how can this be?! 
Heheh, don’t underestimate the kick of the mighty Kanna Kirishima, ya hear? 
The way forward's open, you guys. Let's go! 
Right! 
OK, time to infiltrate the Kanzaki estate! 
We ain't got time for this, Boss. Lemme handle this. 
K-Kanna, hang on! 
Hrrraaahhhhh! 
There we go! 
Well, she sure handled it. 
Un… Unbelievable! The Kanzaki estate's front gate, how can this be?! 
Heheh, don’t underestimate the kick of the mighty Kanna Kirishima, ya hear? 
The way forward's open, you guys. Let's go! 
Right! 
Guess there's nothing else to do but to dash in. 
OK, everyone. Time to infiltrate the Kanzaki estate! 
Whoa, this is one big house, all right. 
And Sumire is somewhere in there right now. 
Yeah. <br> Let's not waste any time. 
Ah, there they are! That horde of ruffians are right over there! After them! 
Damn, we're surrounded! 
Run towards the entrance. 
Fight. 
Everyone, run! <br> Make for the entrance! 
Y-Yes, sir! 
We'll have to fight them off to have a chance at stopping Sumire's marriage. 
Right, leave it to me! 
Boss, get your head outta the clouds if you don't wanna get clobbered! 
Uh, right… 
Don't mind getting your hands dirty! Do whatever you must to stop these hooligans in their tracks! 
That's a laugh! All right, if ya think you can stop us, then just try it! 
Haaaaaahh! Take THIS!! 
That all ya got? <br> C'mon, who's next?! 
Nghh… Come now, what are you lot doing? Keep going, don't stop now! 
Damn, they just keep on coming… 
…! <br> Boss, behind you! 
Crap!! 
They're comin' at you from above! You gotta dodge!! 
Guard your head! 
Guard your abdomen! 
Duck! 
Guard your head! 
Guard your abdomen! 
From above, I should guard my head! 
Yes, I stopped it! 
Nice one, Boss! 
Thanks! Our sparring match yesterday came in handy! 
Do not falter now! <br> Keep it up, for the sake of Lady Sumire! 
I'll guard my abdomen! 
Gwaahhh! 
What the heck, Boss? Didja forget everything we did durin' our spar yesterday?! 
Nicely done! <br> Keep it up, for the sake of Lady Sumire! 
An attack from above? <br> I'd better duck! 
Yes, I dodged it! 
Good one, Boss! <br> I knew ya could do it! 
Thanks! Our sparring match yesterday came in handy! 
Do not falter now! <br> Keep it up, for the sake of Lady Sumire! 
Uhh… If they're coming from above, then I'm supposed to… What was it… 
Gwaahhh! 
What the heck, Boss? Didja forget everything we did durin' our spar yesterday?! 
Nicely done! <br> Keep it up, for the sake of Lady Sumire! 
Damn, these bastards got no sense of honor at all! 
The way things are going… We don't have time for this! 
Ogami! Kanna! 
Leave this to the rest of us! You two go on ahead! 
B-But, if it's only you guys… 
I would ask you not to underestimate me! 
Defeating a mere Japanese man is as simple as eating a piece of cake. 
I get stronger when I'm mad, you know! 
We should have no trouble defeating enemies of this rank. 
Nngh! <br> There are only six of them! Is that the best you can do?! 
Call for reinforcements! <br> We must not allow them to pass through! 
Ogami, hurry! Before their reinforcements arrive! 
Everyone… 
We'll leave this to you! 
No, we'll stay here. 
We'll leave this to you! 
Go easy on them. 
No, we'll stay here. 
Sakura, Iris, Orihime, Reni! We'll leave this to you all! 
The two of us will go after Sumire instead! 
Right! 
Do your best, Mon Frère! 
… 
If you have the time to bark orders, then you have the time to be running! 
Kanna, let's go! 
Right! 
Go a bit easy on them, everyone. 
Otherwise they might give us some nasty medical bills to pay back later. 
Hahaha! Right, understood! 
Mr. Ensign and Kanna, you two be careful as well! Make sure to not break any buildings along the way.
Hahaha! <br> If I'm bein' honest, that's the one thing I ain't too confident about. 
Well, we’re already dirt poor after losin' all our financial support, so I’ll be as careful as I can. 
OK, let's go, Kanna. 
Right! 
No, we'll stay here. We can't just leave you all behind. 
You dumbass, what're you talkin' about?! 
If we don't get a move on, Sumire's really gonna get married off! 
We don't got time to play around with these small fries! We gotta go straight for the prize! 
Kanna's right, Ogami! 
You're the only one who can save Sumire. So please, hurry! 
…All right. We'll leave this to you all. 
OK, let's go, Kanna. 
Right! 
Boss, what're you doin' just starin' into space at a time like this?! 
If we don't get a move on, Sumire's really gonna get married off! 
We don't got time to play around with these small fries! We gotta go straight for the prize! 
Kanna's right, Ogami! 
You're the only one who can save Sumire. So please, hurry! 
…All right. We'll leave this to you all. 
OK, let's go, Kanna. 
Right! 
This must be the entrance. We've finally reached the main house. 
…Yep, it's locked all right. 
Heheh. So what now, Boss? 
We've got no choice. <br> Go ahead, Kanna. 
Yep, leave it to me! 
Heheh. Man, this entryway alone musta cost a fortune. 
Well, in we go. <br> Hoo boy, the inside of this place is just as fancy. 
…Good, looks like there's no one inside. 
Let's get a move on, Boss. We gotta find out which room the marriage interview is takin’ place in. 
This really is an enormous house. Just where could Sumire be? 
Ehn? Hang on a sec. 
Hey, Boss… <br> Looks like your finger's bleedin'. 
Oh, you're right. Maybe I injured it during the fight back there. 
Sheesh, guess I gotta do this. C'mon, gimme your hand… 
Kanna… 
Heheh, just leave this to me. 
Here we go… Ahaha, wait. <br> I think I messed up the wrappin’ a bit. Looks kinda weird. 
I wrap up my own wounds all the time, but it's hard doin' it on someone else. 
Thank you, Kanna. 
You’re kinda bad at this. 
Thank you, Kanna. <br> I… appreciate you taking care of me like this. 
Aw, c'mon, Boss. No need to make a big deal of it, you're gonna make me blush. 
Hahaha, you’re kinda bad at this, aren't you, Kanna? 
Aw, c'mon! That's kinda rude to say, ain't it? 
Hahaha. Sorry, sorry. 
Still, I'm not even any good at tellin' other people about how I feel… 
Hm? Did you say something? 
Uh… N-Nope! <br> D-Didn't say a thing. <br> Hahahaha! 
But hey, even if it ain't that pretty, it'll still do the job, yeah? 
Yup, it's wrapped nice and tight. 
… 
… 
Man, it's kinda… tense in here, eh? Hahaha. 
Y-Yeah… It sure is. 
All right, let's get movin'. We better hurry before Sumire gets married off for real. 
Yeah. It's almost time for the decisive showdown. 
Heheh, that's right! <br> It'll be our final battle. 
Right. Let's go, Kanna! 
… 
… 
Don't just sit there silently, Sumire. Say something. 
… 
Sumire, your grandfather is right. 
Now, dear. <br> There's no need for that… 
Sumire, if you don't at least try speaking to the young man, you won't learn anything about him. 
Lord Makibishi, are you truly all right with this? With things being decided without your input? 
W-Well, I- 
Young master Makibishi, you have no objections, do you? 
… 
Wh-Why, of course not! 
Yoichiro would be fortunate indeed to be wed to the fair young Lady Kanzaki! 
Now that young master Makibishi's wishes have been made known… What say you, Sumire? 
I… I… 
Wait just a damn minute! 
…!! <br> That voice, it couldn't be! 
Who are you people? 
I am Captain Ichiro Ogami of the Imperial Assault Troupe, Flower Division! 
And I'm Kanna Kirishima, also from the Flower Division! 
Ensign… And Kanna… 
Sumire… 
Sumire… 
Hoh, so you are Ogami, then. All this fuss, I presume you must know who I am, then? 
Surely you have not come here in order to embarrass me… 
…Tadayoshi Kanzaki, who has financed the troupe's activities for so many years? 
No. And the troupe is eternally grateful for the support you've given us. 
But this is a completely separate matter! 
I must object to Sumire being forced into a marriage she doesn't want! 
That's right, gramps! If you think things are gonna go your way, you're in for a rude awakenin’!
Fu… Fwahahaha! Such bravado! I suppose I should expect as much, since you've come all this way. 
But Ogami, what would you say to this? 
You are aware that the troupe's financiers are pulling back their funding, are you not? 
…Yes. 
If you agree to leave peaceably right now, I will see to it that your funding is restored. 
However, if you take Sumire with you, you understand what will happen, yes? 
Grandfather! 
That's low, old man! 
Be silent, women! 
… 
… 
Now then, what will you do, Ogami? 
We're taking Sumire back. 
I can't decide on my own.
I understand. 
We're taking Sumire back with us. 
Ensign! 
Boss! 
I… can't make this decision myself. There's too much riding on it. 
B-Boss, what the hell're you sayin'?! 
… 
You said it yourself, Boss! No matter how tough things get, we gotta do this with our own strength!
Sumire's an important part of the Flower Division! 
…Yes. You're absolutely right, Kanna. 
We're taking Sumire back with us! 
Right… 
Is that so? Are you truly all right with following along with the captain's decision? 
Any decision he makes becomes the will of the Imperial Assault Troupe itself. 
Very well. As deputy commander of the Imperial Assault Troupe, I approve of this decision. 
Kaede… Fujieda?! 
So you're Ogami. <br> You're exactly how my sister described you. 
Huh? <br> Ayame… talked about me? 
Fwahahaha! How amusing. 
To think, the Imperial Assault Troupe would go so far for the sake of a single member. 
…Grandfather. <br> I… I'm returning to the Imperial Assault Troupe. 
Were I not to go with them, I am certain I would regret it later. 
Sumire! 
…Very well. <br> Take Sumire with you, then. 
However, the Kanzaki Group will no longer provide any funding to the troupe. Will you accept this? 
Yes! We will continue on, using our own power! 
What is that sound? 
Could it be… the enemy?! 
It seems so. 
But there is no need to worry. We were aware that the enemy planned to attack this area. 
You knew?! 
Your Koubu are all onboard the Soaring Whale, Sumire's included. 
Now, let us depart! 
All right, Boss! <br> We gotta drive any enemies outta the mansion! 
The estate's garden still has quite a few people in it. Evacuating them should be our first priority.
Take out the enemy first!
Civilians take priority! 
Let's take care of the enemy first! We should eliminate any threats on the grounds of the estate! 
Then it should be safe to start evacuating people. 
Civilians' safety takes priority! Don't allow even a single enemy to approach the grounds of the estate!
We need to hold out until everyone is safely evacuated! 
Sumire, wait! 
Father, Mother, I'm going now. 
Sumire… 
… 
It's all right, Sumire. 
Darling, if there's something that is truly precious to you… 
…then you should live as you wish, without any regard to the Kanzaki name. 
Ah…  Sumire… <br> I want you to know that I love you very much. 
Father… Mother… 
I'm going now, because that is what I wish to do! And… 
I will fight for the sake of everything I hold dear! 
That is how I wish to live! 
Heheh. Y'know, Sumire, it's been a while since ya went out on a mission. Ya better not get in my way! 
And I would ask that you take care not to destroy my home with that brutish strength of yours. 
OK, let's go! The others are waiting for us! 
Sorry Ogami, but customers are only allowed to purchase one of each bromide. 
I see. That's too bad. 
So sorry, Mr. Ogami, but customers are only allowed to purchase one of each bromide.
Oh, really? That's too bad.
