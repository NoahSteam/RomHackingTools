I can't believe that such a thing happened to Commander Yoneda. 
What will happen to this Imperial Assault Troupe if he's gone!? 
... 
No. I can't stay down like this forever. 
In times like this, it's my job to cheer everyone as the captain of Flower Division. 
They must be feeling down too. I gotta check on everyone else. 
There's no visitors. We wouldn't expect many until we put on our summer performance, so that makes sense. 
In a situation like this, it's a blessing that we're practically closed... 
It's empty here. No one's around. 
...It feels kind of lonely. I'll check another room. 
Looks like there's nobody here. 
I'll just have to check another room. 
Hello there, Ogami! Would you like to buy something? 
Buy a photo. 
Talk to Tsubaki. 
Leave. 
Could I buy a photo? 
Sorry, Ogami. I can only sell one photo at a time. 
Please understand, we need to keep some for the customers. 
You'd like to buy a photo? Thank you very much! 
That's a photo of Sakura. 
Let's see... Sakura's photo, right? 
That'll be 50 sen. Thank you very much! 
That's a photo of Sumire. 
Let's see... Sumire's photo, right? 
That'll be 50 sen. Thank you very much! 
That's a photo of Maria. 
Let's see... Maria's photo, right? 
That'll be 50 sen. Thank you very much! 
That's a photo of Kanna. 
Let's see... Kanna's photo, right? 
That'll be 50 sen. Thank you very much! 
That's a photo of Iris. 
Let's see... Iris's photo, right? 
That'll be 50 sen. Thank you very much! 
That's a photo of Kohran. 
Let's see... Kohran's photo, right? 
That'll be 50 sen. Thank you very much! 
That's Orihime's photo, isn't it? 
Her photo is very popular right now. 
So make sure you grab it before it runs out! 
Let's see... Orihime's photo, right? 
That'll be 50 sen. Thank you very much! 
That's Reni's photo. 
We just put out that photo for sale, so make sure you get it fast! 
Let's see... Reni's photo, right? 
That'll be 50 sen. Thank you very much! 
Hm, so you're not going to buy any? 
You look cheerful, Tsubaki. 
Yes. Since this is the entrance to the theater... 
...times like these make me want to greet visitors with a smile even more. 
I see... You're very strong. 
Ehe... Thanks a lot. 
But... When visitors are few and I'm alone... 
I can't help but feel... lonely. 
...The manager will be fine. I'm sure that he'll come back here good as new. 
Please greet him with that smile when he gets back, Tsubaki. 
...Yes! You can count on me! 
I'm absolutely going to greet him with that bright smile! 
You can leave meeting the manager to me! 
Well, I should be going. Keep up the good work. 
Thank you very much! Come back soon! 
Tsubaki's surely doing her best to stay cheerful, although it must be hard for her. 
I have to hold myself together, just like her. 
Thank you very much! Come back and buy another photo next month! 
Tsubaki's surely doing her best to be cheerful. 
Looks like no one eats at this hour. Well, of course. 
There's no sign of anyone in the kitchen. Guess I'll check another room. 
Looks like no one's come in. Oh man, what a waste of effort. 
It's really hot and humid. Guess it is the rainy season. 
Looks like nobody's here, guess I'll check another room. 
No one's around. Looks like nobody's visiting the theater before the summer performance opens. 
Guess I'll check another room, then. 
Oh, Ogami. Is there something you need? 
Let me hear any new gossip. 
I'll come back later. 
Sorry, Ogami, but I'm afraid I don't much of anything to tell you about. 
After all of this gloomy news lately... I'm sorry. 
Seems that the culprit who shot Manager Yoneda hasn't been caught yet. 
Rumor has it that it was an assassination attempt organized by foreign operatives, but I wonder if that's true. 
Hmm, I wonder. 
About the enemy that showed up several days ago, they called themselves, "The Black Demon Society", correct? 
Yeah... 
The thing is we still don't know what exactly their motive is. 
How strange. What will happen to this city? 
On top of that, I wonder when Sumire will return... 
Right. She's been at her family's home for two months now. I'm worried about her. 
Kanna, Kohran, and even Maria haven't returned either... 
What will happen to the Flower Division? 
I just noticed, Saki doesn't work in this room, right? 
That's correct. Saki is working as the manager's personal secretary. 
That's why she's not in our office. 
I'm sure that she's worried about Mr. Yoneda, too. To have such thing happened to him... 
We already scheduled "King Lear" for our next performance... 
But with our situation right now, can we even make it? 
I heard this earlier... 
People found Mr. Yoneda... covered with blood in front of the Army Ministry. 
They found him as if here were crawling on the ground to get somewhere before losing consciousness. 
He must have been desperately trying to return to the theater before he blacked out. 
Mr. Yoneda... 
Just as the Flower Division went out to battle, of all days... 
Usually he'd have come along on the mission with everyone. 
Somehow the culprit knew that the manager was headed to the Ministry. 
Where did they get that information from? 
It's said that Mr. Yoneda was shot from the building across from the Ministry of the Army. 
The singular bullet was able hit him from a very far distance... 
So the police believe that the culprit is quite an expert sniper. 
Additionally, there seems to be no clues at the crime scene that might lead us to the culprit. 
The investigation will be difficult. 
Oh... Ogami, have you bought Maria's photo? 
Since she's in America, I thought that at least I can get her photo, so... 
How about I give you Maria's call number, Ogami? 
Are you sure? 
She already gave me her number in case of emergency. 
I'm not sure if it's a good idea to tell her about this whole thing... 
But you can talk to her if you call "13900." 
13900, right? Thanks, Yuri. 
Oh... Ogami, have you bought Kanna's photo? 
Yeah. Since we're so far apart, I figured I should buy it. 
Right. The theater does feels desolate without her around. 
Oh, I know! Ogami, how about I give you Kanna's call number? 
Huh! Are you sure?! 
Of course! Now get ready, Kanna's number is "14000", got it? 
Tune the Cinematron to 14000 so you can talk to her. 
Ogami, Kanna's in the middle of training, so reach out to her with the Cinematron. 
Tell her the whole story right away! 
Yeah, I got it! Thanks, Yuri. 
Oh, Ogami... Have you bought Sumire's photo? 
Yeah. Since she's back at her home, I thought I should at least have this for myself. 
Well, how about I give you her call number, Ogami? 
Are you sure? 
She already gave me her number in case of an emergency. 
I'm sure that she already heard about this incident... 
So try to talk with her for a bit, Ogami. 
You can speak to her if you dial, "13800" on the Cinematron. 
13800, is it? Thanks, Yuri. 
Sorry, I don't have any fun stories for this month... 
But I'm sure gossip will jump into my lap real soon! 
That's right. I heard the manager hasn't paid back the tab for all the liquor he drinks. 
Hahaha, then we really have to bring him back home. 
Well, I'm taking my leave now. Good luck with your work, you two. 
Yes. Thank you for all your hard work as well. 
Come again soon! 
Now, where should I go next? 
Please tell me if anything new happens to the manager, ladies. 
Yes. Thank you for all your hard work as well. 
Come again soon! 
Now, where should I go next? 
... 
Saki... 
Ah, Ogami? 
What are you doing here? 
I... I'm just wandering around in circles. 
The thing is, I was supposed to be helping the manager with his errands. 
To think that this whole incident happened while I was with him... I'm sorry. 
I left him for just a split-second... It's all so upsetting. 
... 
...Well, it's time for me to go. See you around, Ogami. 
Saki... 
Ah... Ogami. 
Sakura, something wrong? 
...I found this photo. 
A photo? 
Yes. I saw it sitting on the manager's desk. 
It's from when Yoneda was fighting alongside my father. 
My father is the one who's standing on the far left. 
He died during The Kouma War seven years ago... 
... 
Other than Mr. Yoneda, everyone's... gone. 
Sakura... 
If we lose Mr. Yoneda, too, I... I... 
Ogami! He's going to be OK, right?! 
He'll be back to his office for sure, soon! 
Yes. I'm certain he'll be back. 
It's hard to say... 
Yes. I'm certain he'll be back. 
It's hard to say... 
Yes. I'm certain he'll be back. 
It's hard to say... 
Slowly grab her shoulder. 
Yes, I'm sure he'll be back. There's no way a man like Mr. Yoneda would die like that. 
...You're right. He'll be back to work in his office in no time! 
I wonder, do you think he'll still be drinking as much as he usually does? 
Hehe. Come on, Ogami. 
Talking to you makes me feel better. Thank you so much, Ogami. 
Well, I'll be taking my leave now... Excuse me. 
Thanks goodness. I hope that cheers her up for a while. 
OK, now let's go to the others. 
...It's hard to say. There's a good chance that he won't regain consciousness. 
H-How could you say that?! I... I don't believe it! 
Yoneda... I know Mr. Yoneda will be back! 
S-Sakura! 
What have I done? In times like these, what I should be doing is lifting their spirits. 
... 
Ogami... 
...Everything will be fine, Sakura. I'm sure Manager Yoneda will come back. 
Let's take a good care of the theater while he's away. 
...Yes! 
Talking to you makes me feel better. Thank you so much, Ogami. 
Well, I'll be taking my leave now... Excuse me. 
Thanks goodness. I hope that cheers her up for a while. 
OK, now let's go to the others. 
... 
No matter how much we try to cheer each other up, without action, they might just end up being empty words. 
For now, let's think about what should we do to take care of the theater. 
...Yes. 
Well, I'll be taking my leave now... Excuse me. 
Let's go find the others, too. 
Looks like Saki has left already. Let's take a look at another room. 
We need to take good care of the theater until Mr. Yoneda comes back... 
No one's here. I thought Orihime would be, though. 
Oh well, I'll just check another room. 
Just as I thought, nobody's here. Let's go to another room. 
No one's here, huh. We don't use this room much when we don't have a play going on. 
When we held Reni's welcoming party here, the manager looked so cheerful... 
...Now's not the time to dwell on the past. I need to move forward. 
No one's here. Hmm... 
...Huh? I thought I heard something coming from the stage. 
It's Sakura, she's cleaning the stage floor. 
I have to keep my head up as well. 
No one's here. Let's check another room. 
No one's here. I don't even feel Kayama's presence like last time. 
What was he doing in this place, anyway? 
Ah... Is that you, Ogami? 
Sakura, what're you doing here? 
Well, I was cleaning up the stage floor. 
I just needed to do something with my hands to get my mind off things. 
You did great. 
Can I help? 
I see. You did a great job so far. 
Thanks! 
Please go talk with the others, Ogami. They need it. 
Yeah, just leave it to me! 
Whew... Now let's go check the others! 
Mind if I help you? 
Hehe, thank you for your consideration. 
But, I'm sorry... 
I just want to do things by myself for now. 
I see... Got it. I know how you feel. 
Keep doing your best then, Sakura. 
Yes! Thank you very much, Ogami. 
Doing things by oneself, huh? 
Maybe she's recalling memories with her father after seeing that picture earlier. 
... 
Ogami? Is there something wrong? 
No, it's nothing. How strong you are, Sakura, to be doing this after what's happened. 
No... I'm just a weakling. 
I'm still an immature little girl who can't stay still because of all this anxiety. 
My father would laugh seeing me like this. 
Sakura... 
I'm sure the others are feeling down as well. Please give them your support, Ogami. 
...Yeah, leave them to me! 
I'll be going. 
...Yes! See you later. 
Whew... Now let's go check the others! 
Oh, Ogami. 
Are you still cleaning up, Sakura? 
Yes... I just needed to do something with my hands to get my mind off things. 
...I see. 
I'll be going now. Keep at it. 
OK. Thank you so much. 
Sakura... She's trying her best to hide her sadness. 
I need to make sure everyone can rely on me. 
No one's here. Let's check another room. 
Our summer performance is coming this month, at last. 
It's bound to do something about the depressing mood this place has had lately. 
I came here again just to be sure. No one's here. 
Sniff... Sniff... 
(...Iris?) 
Sniff... Uncle... *sob* 
... 
Say something. 
Iris... Sorry, I just noticed you were crying. 
Ah... Mon Frère! 
I was thinking just to leave you alone for a bit... 
But after seeing you like that, I just not reach out for you. 
Mon Frère... 
I just... couldn't stop my tears no matter how hard I tried. 
Cheer up, Iris. A sad face doesn't suit you. 
A cheerful smile fits you the best. 
Uh-huh... Thanks, Mon Frère. 
I don't know if I can smile right away... but I'll try. 
I hope there's something I can do to bring back her smile... 
(Let's leave her be for now.) 
(This must be especially hard for her...) 
(That said, you're doing well, Iris.) 
Let's not go to the courtyard for now. 
No one's here, huh. Let's just get going. 
... 
Sakura... 
Ah! Ogami... 
(Sakura... Is she crying?) 
... 
Sorry, Sakura... I'll be going. 
Ogami, were you perhaps... worried about me? 
Y-Yeah. I thought that maybe you didn't want anyone seeing you crying. 
Ogami, you're so... That's very kind of you, Ogami. 
After I saw Iris just now, I couldn't hold my tears either... 
...I'll let you be. Take care. 
...Yes. 
(I-It's not the time to stare at her hair.) 
... 
Ogami, please don't stare at me. 
Oh, sorry... 
(Her tears, she's trying to stop them from rolling down her face...) 
I said don't stare at me! 
S-Sakura... 
I-I don't want you to see me like this... 
(Sakura doesn't want me looking her in the eye.) 
(She's on the verge of sobbing... I don't know where I should look when talking to her.) 
(J-Just where do I look in this situation!?) 
... 
(Oh no, Sakura looks really down...) 
(I better stop staring right now.) 
I-It's surprisingly sunny today, even though it's the rainy season. Wouldn't you say, Sakura? 
... 
(I don't know where I should look while talking to her. What should I do?) 
... 
After I saw Iris just now, I couldn't hold my tears either... 
Sorry, Ogami. I didn't mean to show you my face like this. 
...I'll be going. 
Ah... S-Sakura! 
I'm sorry! 
Sakura... 
I should've just left her alone... 
What a clear sky. It seems like there's a break in the rainy season. 
I hope everyone can be cheerful and bright again, just like this blue sky. 
...Hm? Iris and Sakura are talking to each other. 
There, there, Iris. Don't cry. 
Hic... But, but... 
Iris... 
Ah... Ogami. 
Mon Frère... Is Uncle gonna die? 
I don't want that to happen! Waaaaah! 
Cheer her up. 
Wipe her tears. 
Cheer her up. 
Impersonate her crying. 
It'll be OK, Iris. Cheer up. 
Mr. Yoneda won't die. He'll be back with us safe and sound soon enough. 
...Are you sure? 
Yeah, I'm sure of it. 
What Ogami said was true. It's great to hear that, isn't it, Iris? 
...Yeah. 
I'll try to stay stronger for a while. I'm going now. 
Seems that Iris managed to cheer up. Thank goodness. 
Thank you for consoling Iris, Ogami. 
I somehow feeling better, too. 
Is that so. I'm glad that helps. 
Well, I'm taking my leave too. 
I hope they can cheer up for a bit. 
Iris, here. I'll wipe your tears. 
Oh, Mon Frère... 
For now, let's hold our tears. 
...OK. 
Now, let's smile. 
...OK. Tee-hee, like this? 
Yup, that's great. Are you feeling better? 
Yeah... Thanks, Mon Frère and Sakura. 
I'll try to stay stronger for a while. I'm going now. 
Seems that Iris managed to cheer up. Thank goodness. 
Thank you for consoling Iris, Ogami. 
It touched my heart too. 
Is that so. I'm glad that helps. 
Well, I'm taking my leave too. 
I hope they can cheer up for a bit. 
I don't want Manager Yoneda to die! Uwaaaah! 
M... Mon Frère?! 
Hahaha. Sorry, my bad. I didn't mean to surprise you. 
But, you see, Iris, it was weird to see me crying, right? 
Y-Yeah... 
So, you shouldn't cry as well, Iris. 
Yeah... Thanks, Mon Frère and Sakura. 
I'll try to stay stronger for a while. I'm going now. 
Seems that Iris managed to cheer up. Thank goodness. 
Thank you for consoling Iris, Ogami. 
But I was really surprised to see you crying out of nowhere. 
Hahaha... It was too surprising, I guess. 
Well, I'm taking my leave too. 
I hope they can cheer up for a bit. 
Now, Iris. Don't cry. Ogami is watching. 
Huh... Hic... 
Let's get going now. I'm sure Manager Yoneda will be just fine. 
Yeah... Hic... OK. 
Well now, excuse us, Ogami. 
Oh, uh... Yeah... 
Ugh... I couldn't make myself be helpful for them. Let's just get going. 
No one's here. 
I wonder where everyone is. Let's check another room. 
The seats are empty. 
Everyone must be... having their state of mind empty like these seats. 
Looks like nobody's here. Better check another room. 
They're not here. I wonder if they are holing up in their rooms. 
They must be really shocked by this incident. That's likely to happen. 
No one comes here. Uh... 
Looks like no one's playing at this hour, after all. 
Of course there's no way I'm gonna play, too. Better get going. 
Nobody's here, after all. Guess I'll just get going. 
Now... What should I do? 
Make a call. 
Do it later. 
I gotta tell this to members that are being away, too. 
OK, I'm gonna call them. 
Now... Who should I call? 
Hello, this is the Hanayashiki Branch... 
Kohran? This is Ogami... 
Chief... Right on time! 
Is that true!? Is that true that Mr. Yoneda was being shot!? 
Yeah, it is. 
Hello? This is Maria Tachibana. 
Ah, Maria!? 
Captain... I heard the news about Manager Yoneda's shooting incident from Count Hanakoji. 
Please explain us the details. 
Yeah, got it. 
How's his condition!? Please tell us quickly, Chief! 
Kohran, calm yourself. 
Chief, just tell us, quick! 
No worries, he's OK. 
There's a chance that he may unable to regain consciousness. 
No worries, he's OK. We can't visit him right now, but he'll be discharged in no time. 
Ya sure? Yer serious, right? 
...Yeah, I'm serious. 
What... I'm so relieved my tears just come out. 
... 
... 
Thanks a lot, Chief. At last... I can calm down now. 
OK, I'm gonna get back to work. See ya, guys. 
Captain, about what you said earlier... 
Forgive me, Maria. I... I lied to her. 
It's fine, Captain. I would do the same thing to her. 
You lied so she won't need to worry... I'm sure that she'll understand. 
... 
The doctor said that... There's a chance he may be unable to... regain consciousness. 
I see... So he got hit... by a gunshot. 
Kohran... 
...Thanks for not covering anything and telling the truth, Chief... 
I'll try to pay him a visit soon... 
But... just who in the world that would shot our Manager Yoneda!? 
I absolutely... I absolutely gonna make them pay for it! 
Captain... are you sure that telling the truth would be the best for her? 
I'm not sure, but... 
I just want everyone to know the whole story. 
... 
... 
Chief... Why did ya say nothing? 
... 
I understand... I'll try to pay him a visit soon. 
But... just who in the world that would shot our Manager Yoneda!? 
I absolutely... I absolutely gonna make them pay for it! 
Captain... 
I'm sorry, Maria. That's all I could do. 
... 
I can only pray for the manager, so... 
...please encourage everyone in there, Captain. 
OK, I got it. 
I ended up call Maria and Kohran... 
Kohran... She's not picking up. 
Wah! D-Don't ring so sudden in this situation! 
Huh, Kanna!? So this is your call number... Is something happened in your place? 
Oh, Boss! I'm dealing with a crowd of people right now. Sorry, I'm gonna disconnect. 
Wah! D-Don't ring so sudden in this situation! 
Kanna... Is something happened? 
Boss! I'm dealing with a crowd of people right now. Sorry, I'm gonna disconnect. 
Ah... She cut the call. 
It's no good... There's no response. 
Huh!? Whose number is it? But they're not picking it up. 
Sumire's not picking up. Maybe she's not in her room. 
Uh... No response after all. 
Hello, this is Maria Tachibana. 
Maria!? So this is your call number. 
Oh, Captain. I was just about to call you. 
I heard the news about our manager from Count Hanakoji. 
... 
This is the Hanayashiki Branch! Chief, are ya there!? 
Kohran... 
Chief! And Maria, too! 
Great timing, please tell me the whole thing! 
Maria? It's Ogami. 
Captain, I heard the news about the menager from Count Hanakoji. 
It's midnight in here, but I thought that you may call me so I waited. 
This is the Hanayashiki Branch! Chief, are ya there!? 
Kohran... 
Chief! And Maria, too! 
Great timing, please tell me the whole thing! 
How's his condition!? Please tell us quickly, Chief! 
Kohran, calm yourself! 
Manager is doing fine. He's not in a terrible condition. Captain just told so. 
Ya sure? Yer serious, right? 
...Yes, I'm serious. When have I ever lied to you? 
You're right. You never lied before, Maria. 
What... I'm so relieved my tears just come out. 
... 
... 
Anyway, Captain... Should I return to Japan? 
Yeah... Please. 
Leave this to us. 
Yeah, please. I need you to help us. 
Wait, Maria. Chief may say so... 
...but right now yer still having an important duty of escorting Count Hanakoji, right? 
You can leave this matter to us. 
Kohran... 
...I understand. I'll stay in America for now. 
I get that you're worried, but you can leave this matter to us. 
We'll make sure to deal with this in your place. 
Captain... 
Way to go, Chief! Now that's our captain! 
Rest assured, Maria! Chief will take care of the theater. 
...I understand. I'll stay in America for now. 
Uh... What would be the best... 
Maria, leave this to us. 
I'm getting calm for a bit, and we have our chief, so I think we'll be fine. 
Now we're having a hard time, but let's do our best! OK, Chief? 
Kohran... 
...I understand. I'll stay in America for now. 
OK, I'm gonna back to work right now. See ya, guys. 
Hmhm... Kohran ended up consoled me. 
Maria... 
Please take care of everyone in the Flower Division, Captain. 
I'll pray for the manager's safety from America. 
I ended up call Maria and Kohran... 
Hello, this is Maria Tachibana. 
Oh, Maria!? So this is your number. 
Captain!? So you know my number. 
I'm going to turn the screen on. Please wait for a while. 
Is something the matter? Is there something urgent that you want to talk about? 
No, I just... wanted to talk with for a little more. 
I see... I was actually about to rest. It's already late in here. 
I see. It's midnight in America, isn't it? 
Yes. I'm sorry, but may I excuse myself? 
OK. Good night, Maria. 
Good night... Captain. 
I didn't put too much thought since Cinematron makes us can communicate directly, but... 
We're being far apart indeed. It's now midnight in America. 
Maria's not picking up. 
Good afternoon. This is Capital News. 
There has a new fact discovered regarding the Hex Mechs attack in Shibuya and Uguisudani. 
Both incidents have one thing in common, which is the appearance of the Hex Mechs doing destructive acts. 
The group behind these incident has been identified as, "Black Demon Society." 
This name was found in testimonies from witnesses in both incidents, which make it extremely credible. 
The Metropolitan Police Department and Army have set up task forces that seems to be their way of responding the situation. 
Next is the follow-up report regarding shooting incident of a Second Lieutenant in Army, Yoneda. 
After being shot by an unknown person, Second Lieutenant Yoneda has been hospitalized...

Regarding this incident, The Metropolitan Police Department has give their statement during press conference... 
...that they would proceed to investigate the case based on evidence found at the scene. 
However, given the fact that there are almost no witnesses, they expect that the investigation would be difficult.

Ah, please be careful, Mr. Masked Red. Be safe on your way!" 
Thank you, young lady!" <br> He races Mach Red. <br> Vrooooommmm! 
The mummy is running amid the dark night. Mach Red's spotlight caught its back. 
Before long, they're inside the thicket. The mummy disappears into a mysterious western house at there. 
Could it be that it's the mummy's lair? What waits Masked Red in the old western house? 
Fight on, Masked Red! You're our hero, Masked Red! <br> -The End 
Go, Masked Red! Fight on, Masked Red! Tune in next time! 
I'm worried about the other members, so let's end this transmission. 
Now... Where should I head next? 
Huh? Looks like someone's coming. 
Guess I'll just stop the transmission. 
Excuse me, Ogami. I just got an announcement. 
Is that Kasumi? Wait a second, I'll open the door. 
What's wrong, Kasumi? 
Let's continue later. I'm focusing on consoling the members in here for now. 
Ayame used to live in this room, wasn't she? 
You right there... Is that you, Ensign? 
Hi, Orihime. 
...I heard that the previous deputy commander used to live in this room. 
Now that there's no deputy commander and Mr. Yoneda has collapsed, aren't you discouraged? 
It's just like you said. 
No, I don't feel like that. 
I have you, Orihime. 
It's just like you said. I'm worried about what can I do by myself from now on. 
Heh, just what I thought. Japanese men are so weak! 
In spite of being the captain, I can't believe you express you worry to your member! 
Uh... I-I was... 
In times like this, shouldn't you act more like a captain? 
Let me tell you, everyone's being spineless right now, so you got to set them straight! 
Ah, Orihime... 
Oh boy... I was supposed to encourage her, but I ended up being encouraged by her instead. 
No, I don't feel like that. In times like this, I have to draw everyone together. 
Uh-huh... You're acting like a captain, for once. 
Careful not to put too much 
Well... I need to respond this situation with calm attitude. 
OK... I'll keep this spirit and talk with the members. 
I'm fine... I have you, Orihime. 
Huuuuh!? S-Stop joking!! 
I'm not joking, you know. 
J-Just stop it! It's so gross that I got goosebumps! 
Oh boy... She ran away at full speed. 
...Guess I'll get going too. 
Well, I'd be lying if I said that I'm not discouraged. 
But I'm sure that Ayame will say, "keep yourself together, Ogami" 
if she ever caught me saying things like that. 
Uh-huh... 
I think your way of saying it still sounds like a loser, though. 
Well, just keep at it. 
Now, I should get going too. 
This room is empty for now. Let's go check another room. 
... 
(Orihime? What is she doing in this place?) 
Please... Give me... Amen. 
(She's saying something...) 
...!? Who is it!? 
E-Ensign!? Since when you were there!? 
Well... I just got here. 
And what are you doing in this place, Orihime? 
T-That's none of your business! It has nothing to do with you!! 
Ah... She went away. 
If I'm not mistaken, something like this happened in here before... 
I wonder what does Orihime do in the attic. 
Oh, w-what are you doing in here, Ensign? 
You too, Orihime. What are you doing here? 
Heheh! It has nothing to do with you! 
Now if you'll excuse me. 
What's with her... I'm getting curious. 
Orihime has went away, huh. 
Oh well, I'll just check another room. 
Nobody's here. I'll just have to check another room, then. 
In times like this, I want to read books slowly and forget the time. 
No. I gotta encourage the members first. 
Nobody's here, huh. There's nothing but reeks of mold. 
Reni... Is she inside? 
It's just a piece of paper from a notebook. I suppose that's fitting for someone like Reni. 
I better check another room, I guess. 
...Who's there? 
It's Ogami. Can I talk for a while? 
... 
OK, excuse me. 
Sorry, am I bothering you? 
Not particularly... 
(Guess I'll try to talk with her directly.) 
(Her gray hair looks unusual...) 
... 
(What a beautiul eyes... But, somehow I don't feel any emotion out of them) 
... 
... 
(He just keep staring me with those blank gaze, I accidentally averted my eyes away.) 
(Expressionless just like usual, huh...) 
... 
(His clothes are neat, looks like it make him easy to move. It fits him well.) 
... 
(I can't keep up with the conversation. Guess I should leave.) 
Thanks for having me, Reni. I gotta go now. 
...I have to go to somewhere else too. 
(What's that...? If it's a brooch, usually girls are the ones who wearing it.) 
(It's framing a jewel with the same color as Reni's eyes) 
... 
(Her room looks tasteless, though.) 
Reni... Where do you usually sleep? 
I sleep on the chair. 
Don't you have any other furniture, like a bed or a dresser? 
...I don't need such unnecessary things. 
O-OK... 
(It'd be rude for me to look all around here.) 
Reni, what's your opinion regarding today's incident? 
You must be shocked that Manager Yoneda got shot, so how's your condition? 
Consider the angle of the bullet that penetrated him, andã€€the degree of his wound... 
By keeping those aspects on mind, I calculate that the culprit shooted from far away. 
It must have been done by a professional. 
How do you get that? 
It must have been done by a professional. 
How do you get that? 
T-That's not what I'm talking! 
So it must have been done... by a professional. 
True. It's possible that the culprit has undergone training for sharpshooting. 
Way to go, Reni. You're an expert on this kind of matter. 
How do you get that, Reni? 
I've also experienced in that. 
Huh?! 
T-That's not what I'm asking! What I want to ask is... 
Doesn't it shocks you... or something like that. 
...No. 
R-Reni... 
I answered your question. Is that enough? 
Oh, uh... Yeah... 
(I actually wanted to ask a different question...) 
I have to go to somewhere else. 
H-Hey, wait a minute... 
Ah, he went away. 
... 
He left me just like that. Guess I better get going too. 
... 
Looks like Reni's not here. He said about going somewhere, I guess. 
Looks like Reni's not here. 
Sakura... Is she inside? 
Too bad, she's not here. 
It's just like Sakura to have a cute nameplate like this. 
Let's go check another room. 
If Kanna was around, she would surely brighten up the mood. 
When she'll get back... Kanna... 
A nametag hangs on the door, almost as if it's guarding Kanna's room. 
There's no reason to hang around since Kanna's gone. I'll go somewhere else. 
Orihime... Is she inside? 
The nameplate has a simple design, but it sure looks high class. 
I better check another room, I guess. 
...Who is it? 
It's Ogami. Can I talk with you, Orihime? 
I refuse. It's time for my "siesta." 
What's a siesta? 
Have a nice nap. 
It's not the time for a nap! 
What's a siesta? 
Heheh! So you don't know about siesta, huh, Ensign? 
Siesta means, "taking a nap." 
My mood will get bad if I don't do it, so good night! 
H-Hey, Orihime! 
... 
Oh boy, she's really went sleep. 
Looks like it's not a good time for talk. 
Can't help it. Have a nice nap, Orihime. 
Good night! Don't dwell yourself too much, Ensign. 
It's good to have a nap sometimes. 
Oh boy, she's being so carefree. 
Orihime, now's not the time for having a nap! 
What a nuisance! Just when I'm about to have a nap! 
What's your deal, Ensign!? 
We got to do something after Manager Yoneda got shot! 
How can you taking a nap in times like this? 
Ugh... I've had enough of this! 
Do you actually think that Mr. Yoneda will recover if I stay awake? 
Taking a nap is the best way to rest. Don't just assuming things based on your imagination! 
I-I see... 
You're the captain, so you should calm down! 
I'm gonna have my siesta for now, so don't disturb me! 
Ugh... I ended up getting yelled at. 
You got nothing to talk about? OK, good night! 
I was about to talk with her, but let's do it later. 
Orihime is having her siesta right now, so let's just leave her be. 
There's no response. I wonder if Orihime is going somewhere. 
In times like this, having Maria with us could be more reassuring. 
She's in New York right now, so of course she's not here. 
It's Maria's nameplate. 
There's no reason to hang around since Maria's gone. I'll go somewhere else. 
Iris... Is she inside? 
So Iris's nameplate is shaped like Jean-Paul... 
I better check another room, I guess. 
Iris's not here. Where did she go? 
Kohran must've been shocked to hear about today's incident. 
She's at the Hanayashiki Branch, isn't she? 
A gear-shaped nameplate, huh? It's just like her. 
There's no point in staying here without Kohran around. Let's head to another place. 
Sumire might come back here soon, but... 
...she's still in her home. 
This is a pretty subtle design, considering it's Sumire. 
There's no reason to hang around since Sumire's gone. I'll go somewhere else. 
Manager Yoneda talked about Lieutenant Yamazaki in here some time ago. 
Manager was sad about Lieutenant Yamazaki's death, and now such a thing happened to him. 
We got to take care of this room until Manager Yoneda returns. 
I can't feel down right now. I just got to look forward! 
Oh, Ogami. Such a fantastic room we have here! 
Yeah. This steam processor is so great that there are only few of these in Japan. 
Too bad I don't understand what's so great about this place at all. 
I have the same thought. I don't understand what kind of move that would occur in which part. 
Well, it's nice too see strange things like this. I'll see you later, Ogami. 
Speaking of "strange", I guess there would be nothing as strange as this, though. 
Looks like Saki has already seen enough. Nobody's here anymore. 
I guess I better get going too. 
Even though we already have an intensive care unit in the theater, we ended up not using it now. 
Manager was sent to the Army Hospital right away, so we got no choice. 
Now that I think about it, I wonder if Manager Yoneda's doing fine right now... 
The scent of medicines reminds me of him in the hospital earlier. 
Manager Yoneda... 
Reni took her bath in here earlier. 
But jeez, I was really surprised to know that she's a girl. 
This humid weather makes me want to take a quick bath. 
No. Hold it, hold it. I got to encourage the members first. 
I want to take a quick bath, but... let's hold it for now. 
Right now I gotta talk to every members. 
Oh? Looks like someone's in the bathroom right now. 
These are Reni's clothes. He must have been sweating a lot after training. 
How's the water temperature? 
Let's check another room. 
How's the water temperature? 
Let's check another room. 
Let's take a quick bath too. 
Reni, how's the water temperature? 
...Good. 
Well, looks like he's relaxing himself. 
OK, now let's check the others. 
I'd feel bad for interrupting him while he's relaxing, so let's head to another room. 
OK, I'm gonna take a quick bath too. 
We're both boys, so I'll try to talk to him while washing his back. 
Hi, Reni. Is it OK to join you? 
... 
Wash his back. 
Soak in the bathtub. 
Sing. 
OK, Reni. Let me wash your back. 
Huh? I didn't expect your body would look so slender. 
You look like a girl. 
... 
And, is this just me, or does your chest... 
... 
R-Reni... D-Don't tell me you're actually, a... 
...I'm a girl. 
Wh-Whaaaaaaaatttt!? 
S-Sorry! I didn't know you were a girl! I'm sorry for barging in! 
...I'm not bothered. No need to apologize. 
There are still some functional difference between male and female. 
A-Anyway, I'm getting out right away. Sorry for barging in!! 
Huft... Huft... I thought my heart was going to jump out of my chest. 
But still... To think that Reni is a girl... Uh... 
Despite being a girl, how did she learn techniques and knowledge about warfare? 
I don't think she would answer even if I ask her. Uhm... 
Phew, this bath feels great. 
Somewhat I feel like it's warmth seeped into the bottom of my heart. 
...I'm getting out first, then. 
Getting out already? You should've just enjoy it for a while. 
The blood circulation in my muscles has improved by the effect of heat and increasing blood pressure. This is enough for me. 
Oh, jeez. That's just so like you. 
Phew, that was a great bath. 
Oh no, 15 minutes have passed! 
Hmm hmm~ Hmm~ Hmm~ 
Why don't you try singing too, Reni? It feels good to hear the echoes of your singing. 
I've never sung outside of my performances. 
Huh? So you've never humming or singing for yourself? 
Yeah, since it's not necessary. 
I'm getting out first. 
Oh, jeez. That's just so like you. 
Phew, that was a great bath. 
Oh no, 15 minutes have passed! 
... 
What? 
I-I just... You look like a girl from behind. 
And, is this just me, or does your chest... 
... 
R-Reni... D-Don't tell me you're actually, a... 
...I'm a girl. 
Wh-Whaaaaaaaatttt!? 
S-Sorry! I didn't know you were a girl! I'm sorry for barging in! 
...I'm not bothered. No need to apologize. 
There are still some functional difference between male and female. 
A-Anyway, I'm getting out right away. Sorry for barging in!! 
Huft... Huft... I thought my heart was going to jump out of my chest. 
But still... To think that Reni is a girl... Uh... 
Despite being a girl, how did she learn techniques and knowledge about warfare? 
I don't think she would answer even if I ask her. Uhm... 
... 
Reni... 
Sorry about earlier. 
So you're a girl... 
Let's get into the bath again. 
Sorry about earlier. 
It's cute when you put it that way. 
Let's get into the bath again. 
I'm sorry about earlier. I didn't realize that you were... a girl. 
...I don't mind. 
But... does everyone already know that you're a girl. 
I don't know. You can tell them if that's important to you. 
Is that... OK for you? 
I don't bother. I don't mind of things like gender. 
...I'm leaving. 
Reni... 
So you're a girl... Man, I was really surprised. 
Yeah. I don't mind about it, though. 
People just set on their mind that I'm a boy. 
Set on...? What's that supposed to mean? 
So you're a girl, huh... It's cute when you put it that way, though. 
Cute? 
Is that... a good thing? 
Y-Yeah... I was about to praise you here. 
OK, I'll take that as a good thing. 
So Reni is a girl, huh... I get it. 
I don't know how should I say this... but somehow, I'm happy. 
Since you said that gender has nothing do with you, how about we go to the bath... again? 
Just once is enough for me. I'm not doing wasteful thing. 
Ah... Did I went too far? 
If you got nothing to talk, I'm leaving. 
Ah, R-Reni! 
I should've just straightly apologize to her. 
Reni has gone. Perhaps she go to somewhere else after done changing. 
Guess I better get going too. 
I want to swim for a while to relieve my mind. The weather has been humid too. 
Let's not do it. I gotta consider the others' feelings. 
Nobody's here. Guess I'll just check another room. 
Hi, Reni. Are you training right now? 
...I'm about to finish. 
You're not acting different from usual. Aren't you depressed? 
Why? 
Why"? About Manager Yoneda who got shot, of course. 
...It can't be helped. It's his fault for putting his guard down. 
How could you say that? 
You may be right... 
How could you say things like that!? We're talking about a person who's hanging between life and death! 
But that's what happens in warfare. 
What's done is done. What matters is what we do next. 
If we think it without harboring any feeling, you may have a point, but... 
There's no place for emotion in warfare. 
You may be right. What matters is to prevent the same thing happen twice. 
We may have to steel ourselves so things like this won't happen again anymore. 
True. 
T-That's some way to say it, Reni. 
I'm just saying what's on my mind. 
What's done is done. What matters is what we do next. 
If we think it without harboring any feeling, you may have a point, but... 
There's no place for emotion in warfare. 
I'm going now. 
Ah, Reni! 
Ah, Reni went away. 
Nobody's here. Guess I'll check another room. 
Nobody's here. All I found are junks and reek of oil. 
My, Ogami. Fancy meeting you here. 
Oh, Saki. What're you doing in here? 
I came here to see the Koubu. 
Now that I'm working at this theater, I just want to look at everything. 
I see... 
Seeing these fancy things really is satisfying. Well, I'll see you later, Ogami. 
She's right. You can only see these thing in this hangar. 
There's nothing to do in here. Saki has gone too. 
...Ogami. 
What's wrong, Kasumi? 
I just got contacted by a person from the sponsors... 
He said that all of the sponsors will cut their supports to the theater altogether. 
Wh-What!? That's just so sudden. W-Why... 
I don't understand, but if it keeps going like this... 
The Imperial Assault Troupe will soon run out of funds. 
Damn it... Why now, of all times?! 
Ogami... 
What should we do about this? 
Hmm... 
Let's do our best on Summer performance! 
Let's endure it. 
We're done for. 
I know, let's do our best on Summer performance! 
If it success, many visitors will come to see it... 
...and we can manage the funding for sure! 
I see.... That's a great idea! 
What's more, we need to have an objective in order to shake off gloomy mood that shrouds everyone. 
If everyone give their all doing rehearsals for Summer performance, we can forget our sadness! 
For now, we have to endure it. We're just having a bad luck, so there's nothing we can do. 
We need to endure ourselves... until good luck comes. 
But Ogami, if we stay silent, our funds won't be enough. 
Is that so? Uh... 
Ogami, I have a suggestion. 
If our next Summer performance becomes a success, many visitor will come to see it, and we can manage the funds. 
Let's do our best for the Summer performance, so that we can drive away this depressing atmosphere. 
...You're right. Perhaps that'll be a good idea. 
We're done for. Why these bad stuffs are coming one after another... 
Ogami, please don't say something so discouraging. 
All of us, including me, are putting our hopes in you right now. 
Sorry... You're right, I was too weak-willed. 
But... how are we supposed to break ourselves from this situation? 
Ogami, I have a suggestion. 
If our next Summer performance becomes a success, many visitor will come to see it, and we can manage the funds. 
Let's do our best for the Summer performance, so that we can drive away this depressing atmosphere. 
...You're right. Perhaps that'll be a good idea. 
Ugh... What should we do!? 
Ogami, I have a suggestion. 
If our next Summer performance becomes a success, many visitor will come to see it, and we can manage the funds. 
Let's do our best for the Summer performance, so that we can drive away this depressing atmosphere. 
...You're right. Perhaps that'll be a good idea. 
Well, how about we gather everyone from the Flower Division in the Dressing Room? 
OK, Kasumi. Well, let's make the summer performance a success! 
Sorry Ogami, but each customer is only allowed to purchase one photo at a time. 
I see. That's too bad... 
I'm sorry, Ookami. I can only sell you one piece at a time to the same person. 
Oh, really? That's too bad...
