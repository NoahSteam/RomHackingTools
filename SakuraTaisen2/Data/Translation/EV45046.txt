Heya, Chief! Why won't you bring me along with you?
Well, you see…
You're too important to me…
I want you to lead them. 
You're too important to me, Kohran. I couldn't bear to let anything bad happen to you.
H-Hey Chief, where'd that come from all of a sudden?
I'm part of the Flower Division too, so I wanna fight with you! It's weird having you fuss over me.
I-I'm sorry, Kohran. I shouldn't have said that.
…Aw, it's OK. Makes me kinda giddy to know you feel that way.
Look, you just leave these guys to me and go do your thing!
OK then. Make me proud, Kohran.
I know that if I leave the second squad in your command, I'll have nothing to worry about.
Huh?! Wait, that's what you wanted to do?
Man, I'm sorry. Guess I went jumping to conclusions, there.
It's OK. Anyway, I'm counting on you to handle those enemies, Kohran.
Alrighty then! Just leave it to me!
Um, no reason in particular, I guess…
Huh, really?
I'm sorry, Kohran. It seems like I've just made things more uncomfortable…
Nah, you're fine. I guess it's no biggie.
We'll handle these guys over here. You go give 'em hell, Chief!
…OK. Thanks, Kohran.
