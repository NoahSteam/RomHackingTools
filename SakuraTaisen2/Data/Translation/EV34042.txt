Hey, you! The yellow one, zippin' around everywhere!!
…? <br> The yellow one? You mean me?
Y-You mean… She's just a kid?
Hmph! I'm 12, you know! I'm not a kid!!
D-Dammit, if anyone finds out I got beaten by a brat, I'll never hear the end of it.
I'm not gonna go easy on you just cause you're a kid! …Let's go!!
