This many artilleries… Despite riding Koubu, it'll be dangerous to get directly hit by them.
In that case, you can use "Captain Commands"!
Well, it does sounds quite fun to use "Fire" formation that emphasizes attack.
But using "Mountain" formation so that we can still keep going despite receiving blows is also great.
But please be careful. You can only use Captain Commands during your turn.
OK. I'll give commands carefully with the "Captain" option to advantage our battles.
