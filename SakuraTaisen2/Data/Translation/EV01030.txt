With this much artillery... It would be dangerous to attack head on, even in the Koubu.
In that case, now sounds like a good time to use "Captain Commands"!
Well, emphasizing attack power with the “Fire” strategy sounds like the funner option to me…
It might also be good to increase our defense with the "Mountain" strategy so we can withstand attacks.
But the Captain Commands can only be used during your turn, Ogami. So please be careful.
Understood. I’ll make good use of the "Command" option to get the upper hand in battle.
