Imperial Assault Troupe… <br> And you… Sakura… 
Father! 
… 
Father… Your sword lives on inside me. 
The sword of justice… The style you taught me in Sendai…
I’ve inherited your technique and carry it in my heart.
Urgh… Guh… 
I am Sakura Shinguji… Daughter of Kazuma Shinguji! 
Urgh… 
My mask… My mask! 
Father! Hold on, Father! 
Sakura… <br> My, how you've grown. 
Father… <br> What happened to you? 
…Eight years ago, I lost my life in the Kouma War. 
I was brought back… by Kyogoku's necromancy… 
As a soldier… to fight for him. 
No… 
His spell was… powerful… But… you broke it… 
You truly are… my daughter… You did well, Sakura… You've grown… so strong… 
Father… 
Demon King… <br> It seems your usefulness has reached its end. 
…! <br> That voice! 
We meet again… <br> Imperial Assault Troupe. 
Kyogoku! 
I granted both Shinguji and Yamazaki temporary life. They were my… puppets, so to speak. 
Now that Musashi has returned, I no longer have any need for such pawns. 
Kyogoku! 
You won't get away! 
Justice will prevail! 
How dare you toy with people's lives! You won't get away with this! 
Know your place, Ogami! 
Lofty ideals require sacrifice! 
Justice… will always prevail! 
Fool! Justice is nothing more than a fleeting convenience! 
Hmph! Have you no words, Ogami?! 
Maggots! You who would govern this city with your fraudulent justice! 
This is the end for you! 
DIE!! 
EEEEEK!! 
DAMN IIIIIT!! 
GWAAAAAGH! 
Wh… What?! 
F-Father?! 
K-Kyogoku… I won't let you… have your way! 
I won't let you… <br> kill my Sakura! 
Father!! 
Sakura… Listen to me… 
The giant crystal in this room… is the power source… controlling the Kouma Weapons. 
Perform the Rite of Four Swords… Destroy the crystal to seal away this evil. 
Then… strike down all the pillars… in the hall just beyond here! 
Shatter Kyogoku's ambitions! 
Urgh… Damn you! 
Sakura… <br> Show me your face… <br> One last time… 
Father! 
Sakura… <br> Stay strong and live! 
No! 
Sakura… <br> You've developed a strong, unwavering sword arm. 
Father…  No, don't go!! 
If only for a brief moment… I'm so glad… I could speak with you… as your father. 
Sakura… Tell your mother… I… love her… 
FATHERRRR!! 
Damn you, Shinguji… <br> To think he could take the full brunt of my power… 
Kyogoku, you bastard! 
I've used up all my strength, so I must retreat for now. Consider yourselves lucky. 
However… <br> When next we meet… <br> It will be your doom. 
Damn you, Kyogoku… 
… 
Sakura… 
Fa… ther… 
I… will live on. 
On your behalf… <br> I will keep on living!
Sakura… 
I'll treasure the life you and Mother gave me. 
I'll stay strong and live on… Father. 
All we can do to stop Kyogoku is perform the Rite of Four Swords. 
Ogami… Let's do this. 
OK, got it! 
Will you be all right?
OK, got it! 
Let's perform the Rite of Four Swords and seal away this evil! 
Roger! 
Sakura… Will you be all right? 
You don't have to worry. My feelings are under total control. 
Sakura… 
… 
I'll be fine, Ogami. 
You don't have to worry. My feelings are under total control. 
Sakura… 
If we combine our strength, the Rite of Four Swords is sure to work. 
We have to try, Ogami. We have to protect everyone! 
Right! 
Sakura… <br> The ensign is with you. This will absolutely work. 
Good luck, Sakura. With the Captain by your side, this is bound to work. 
You'll be fine, Sakura. This'll totally work. 
I mean, ya got the boss with ya, right? 
It's gonna be OK, Sakura! It's totally gonna work! 
Mon Frère's with you! It's definitely gonna work! 
You got nothing to worry about, Sakura. You got the chief with ya! 
With Mr. Ensign by your side, Sakura, this will most certainly work! 
The odds of your success are approximately 100%. 
With the Captain at your side… This is sure to work.

Father… 
I'll stay strong and live on! 
Sakura… 
Ogami… Everyone… <br> Come on, let's go! 
And let’s make sure we all return home together!
Now then, let us be off! 
And let's ensure we all return together! 
Everyone, here we go! 
We're coming back from this alive! 
C'mon, let's go, guys! 
And let's make it back alive! 
Good luck, everybody! 
Let's all go home together! 
All right, everyone, let's roll! 
And let's make sure we make it outta here alive! 
All right, everyone, let's go! 
And let's make it back home alive! 
Everyone… Let's go. 
Let's make sure… we come back home alive. 
OK, here we go! It's time to infiltrate Musashi's core! 
Sir, yes, sir! 
Incoming transmission from the capital! Relaying it now. 
The Kouma in the capital… have ceased all activity… simultaneously! 
The Rite of Four Swords worked! 
EEEEK! They did iiiit! 
It's too early to celebrate. Musashi's not sunk just yet. 
Ogami… Take Musashi down… 
Everyone in the Flower Division… Please… Bring down Musashi. 
Kazuma… 
All right! Hurry with the Mikasa's maintenance!
