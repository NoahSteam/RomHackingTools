There's more Kouma coming!
Second wave of Kouma, incoming!
It's no good! Our cannons on deck are totally destroyed!
All cannons, open fire!
It's no good, there's too many of them, we can't shoot them all down!
Ogami! The Mikasa is gradually gaining altitude.
The Kouma shouldn't be able to do anything once the air gets too thin. Just hold out till then!
OK, understood!
