Reni? What's wrong?
The Flower Division are… pretty good, huh? They're fighting together in perfect unison.
Yes. I hate to admit it, but our Star Division could never do the same.
Even though our technique and combat efficiency outclass theirs.
It really is something, how strong they can be when they're working together.
…But still, they are hopeless without us!
Come on, let's get moving, before they get themselves into trouble!
…Agreed. Let's go, Orihime.
