…So you've come.
The Imperial Assault Troupe has arrived!!
Captain! Over there! <br> It's the Demon King!
…?! <br> The Pandemonium Regalia… They're resonating!
Demon King, we're taking back the Regalia you stole!
Very well, but in exchange, you will offer me Sakura Shinguji's life.
With no one left to use the Power of Purification, the Regalia are useless to us anyway.
Like we'd ever do that! We'll protect Sakura!
In that case, you'll have to take the Regalia by force.
