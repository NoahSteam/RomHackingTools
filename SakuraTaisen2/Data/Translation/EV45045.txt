Mon Frère, I wanted to go, too!
Hey, how come you didn't pick me?
Well, you see…
You're so important to me…
To take care of the others.
You're very important to me, so…
…I didn't want anything bad to happen to you.
M-Mon Frère…
I'm sorry. I guess you were just worried about me.
But I'll do my very best, so you'd better do your best, too!
I thought I’d entrust you with taking care of the other team.
Mon Frère…
You can take those enemies over there, Iris.
OK! I'll take down alll the bad guys!
Um, no reason in particular, I guess…
Huuuh? Are you serious?!
Sorry… Guess that was the wrong thing to say.
No, it's OK.
Well, please handle those enemies, Iris.
OK! You just leave it to me!
