There! That's all the cannons taken care of!
We did it! All the cannons have been destroyed!
Hmhm, such weak little cannons were never any match for one such as myself.
All cannons destroyed! We can rest a little easier from here on out.
Awright, that's the last one! All finished, Boss!
Woohoo, yaaay! We beat all of them, Mon Frere!
Wahoo! That's every last cannon taken down!
And here is the final one! Destroying such shoddy cannons was easier than blinking!
All cannons subdued.
