The Imperial Assault Troupe has arrived!
Just as I expected, Imperial Assault Troupe. That's what makes you worth defeating.
Suiko… <br> No, Saki… <br> Is there nothing we can do?
Is there really no way you can go back to being our friend?
Friend this, comrade that… <br> It's always the same thing with you! <br> You make me sick.
I don't need any friends. As long as I have my master, that's enough for me.
Justice is hypocrisy! Love is for the weak of heart!
Suiko!
The time I spent with all of you… I really did enjoy it.
Seeing you so frantic and distraught, unaware that I was the one who shot Yoneda… Heheheheh…
Damn you! Just how low will you stoop to?!
In battle, the ends justify the means!
No more… We won't let you have your way anymore, Suiko! We're going to stop you!
Heheheh… Finally getting serious, are we?
Wh-What… What on earth?!
Ready or not, here I come!
