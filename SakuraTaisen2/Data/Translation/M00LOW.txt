Hee hee!<br>This is too easy!
The Flower Division must not be all that great if guys like these cause such a fuss for them.
The Imperial Assault Troupe has arrived!
Orihime, are you all right?!
I'm fine!<br>This is a piece of cake!
I'm going to keep doing my thing, so worry about yourselves, OK?
Orihimeee!<br>It's too dangerous by yourself!
If we don't all work together, we'll run into big trouble!
Relax, I'm on a whole different level compared to you all.
OK, I'll be going on ahead!<br>You just sit right there and watch me work.
O-Orihime...!
OGAMI!<br>Quit dawdling and get to work! The enemy's right there!
Hostiles approaching the theater!
We can't risk them getting any closer!
...All right! Deploy the curtain!
Roger! Deploying the Imperial Theater Defensive Curtain!
Now you don't have to worry about the theater, Ogami. Just focus on the fighting!
Thank you, Commander Yoneda!
Let's go, everyone!<br>Commencing combat operations!
