Hee hee! <br> This is too easy!
The Flower Division must be sad indeed if enemies like this are enough to cause such a fuss.
The Imperial Assault Troupe has arrived!
Orihime, are you all right?!
I am fine! <br> This is but child's play!
Worry about yourselves. I shall continue as I please.
Orihimeee! <br> It's too dangerous to go alone!
If we don't all work together, we'll run into big trouble!
Relax, I am on a whole different level compared to you all.
Now then, I will be going on ahead! Sit right there and watch me work.
O-Orihime…!
OGAMI! <br> Quit wasting time and get to work! The enemy is right at our doorstep!
Hostiles approaching the theater!
We can't risk them getting any closer!
…All right! <br> Deploy the curtain!
Roger! <br> Deploying the Imperial Theater Defensive Curtain!
Now you don't have to worry about the theater, Ogami. Just focus on the battle!
Thank you, Commander Yoneda!
Let's go, everyone! <br> Commencing combat operations!
