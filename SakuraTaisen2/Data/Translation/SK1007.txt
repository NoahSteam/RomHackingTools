Kyogoku... How are you still alive?! 
Didn't you kill yourself after the coup was put down?! 
I thought you already took responsibility for that failure. 
The Taisho Restoration was nothing more than just a diversion. My true goals are more paramount than something like that. 
Then, the man who committed suicide must be... 
A decoy... 
I get it... It was his body double! 
This torii gate... <br> Kyogoku! What exactly are you up to? 
Once the seal is released, the power of all these vengeful spirits shall rise again. 
All in order to return Tokyo to what it should be. It will be a purification, so to speak. 
W-What?! 
I won't let you! 
Return to what? 
I won't let you! You will not act as you please! 
You won't let me... Hmmph, know your place, Ogami! 
Return Tokyo to what it should be? 
You fools who are unware of Tokyo's true nature, still defending the city like this. 
I don't blame your ignorance. However, to not desire the truth is a grave sin. 
... 
You seem to know a little. Scared beyond words, aren't you? 
I admit that you have some strength. However, that's all you will ever have. 
Once the Octagram of Demonic Calling is unleashed, no one can prevent Tokyo from collapsing. 
We won't let you do as you like, Keigo Kyogoku! Begone! 
I shall not let you touch Lord Kyogoku! Your lives are now at my disposal! 
...T-That stance! 
Sakura, what's wrong? 
No... It can't be... 
But, that stance... <br> Father... <br> That has to be my father!! 
Wh-What?! The Demon King is... your father?! 
... 
Demon King! Is that... Is that true?! 
Are you Sakura's father?! 
... 
No... This is ridiculous!! 
The time is nigh. All that's left is to unleash the Octagram. 
I'll reveal your true form, Tokyo! I, Kyogoku, shall harness all of the regret and resentment! 
Rise, Musashi! Come and reveal your might! 
Aaaaaahhh!! 
W-What in the-?! Look out! The ground is splitting apart! 
Dammit... Just what... What in the world is happening?! 
Oh, Musashi, the great cocoon that will return this cursed Tokyo to its original state. 
The raging torrent of power released shall swallow everything... 
The great will that lies dormant in its womb, shall awaken! For I, Kyogoku!

The great will that lies dormant in its womb, shall awaken! For I, Kyogoku! 
False Tokyo... It is time to rip off your accursed mask! 
Now things have been set in motion. This cursed city shall shed its facade... 
And the true Tokyo shall rise at last! Hahahahaha!
