Kyogoku… <br> How are you still alive?! 
Did you not commit suicide after the coup was put down?! 
I thought you had taken responsibility for your failure.
The Taisho Restoration was nothing but a diversion. My true objective… is far more grand.
Then, the man who died must have been…
A decoy… 
I get it… <br> It was his body double! 
That torii gate…<br>Kyogaku! What the hell are you plotting?!
Once this seal is removed, the vengeful souls trapped beneath Tokyo shall unleash their power…
Yes, all to restore Tokyo to its former glory… A purification, so to speak. 
W-What?! 
I won’t let that happen!
Tokyo's former glory?
I won’t let that happen! I’ll put a stop to your plans!!
Put a stop to my plans… Know your place, Ogami! 
Return Tokyo to its former glory?
You are fools, defending the capital without knowing its true form…
I will not blame you for your ignorance. However, it is a grave sin to not desire the truth. 
… 
Are you too afraid to speak? Even you seem to realize the gravity of this moment…
I will acknowledge that you have some skill. However, this is as far as you go.
Once the Octagram is unleashed, no one will be able to stop the destruction of this Tokyo.
We won’t let that happen! Draw your sword, Keigo Kyogoku!
You won’t lay a finger on Lord Kyogoku! Your life is mine!
…Ah, t-that stance! 
Sakura, what's wrong? 
No… No, it can't be… 
But, that stance… Father…<br>That has to be my father!! 
Wh-What?! <br> The Demon King is… <br> your father?! 
… 
Demon King! <br> Is that… Is that true?! 
Are you really… <br> Sakura's father!?
… 
No… This is ridiculous!! 
The time has come… <br> All that's left is to unleash the Octagram.
Tokyo, reveal your true form! Your regret, your resentment… I, Kyogoku, will accept it all!
Musashi, reawaken! <br> Come, show me your might!
Noooooo! 
W-What the hell?! <br> Everyone, look out! The ground is splittin’ open!!
Dammit… Just what… What in the world is happening?! 
O Musashi… <br> O mighty chrysalis, restore this accursed capital to its true form!
The raging torrent of power released shall swallow everything… 
And then, the great will that lies dormant in its womb shall be awakened! All for the sake of I, Kyogaku!
O Musashi… <br> O mighty chrysalis, restore this accursed capital to its true form!
The raging torrent of power released shall swallow everything… 
And then, the great will that lies dormant in its womb shall be awakened! All for the sake of I, Kyogaku!
False Tokyo… <br> It is time to rip off your accursed mask! 
Everything is now in motion. This cursed capital will be wiped off the face of the earth…
At last, the true Tokyo shall be reborn! Hmhahahaha!
