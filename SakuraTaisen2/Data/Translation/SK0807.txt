Great work, everyone! You managed to retrieve the rest of the Pandemonium Regalia. I’m impressed.
Thank you, sir! 
Uh-huh... So this is that "Regalia" thing, huh? 
...That’s right.
The sword... 
The mirror... 
And the jewel... 
Because of these things, Yamazaki... and Kazuma... 
... 
With the Regalia… My father used the Power of Purification…
And that same power… flows through my veins as well.
Sakura... 
... 
I… I need to be alone for a while.
I'm sorry for sounding selfish... But please... 
... 
Come on, everyone... Let's go. 
Sakura... 
People are helpless before power... 
There are those who are obsessed with power, always seeking greater strength…
There are those that devote themselves to power for the sake of peace, to protect their loved ones…
And then there are those who are overwhelmed and suffer in the face of such power… Like Sakura is now.
... 
Ogami, I must ask you something. 
Yes... What is it? 
Protecting the sanctity of the capital… And protecting the lives of your comrades…
That is your duty as captain of the Flower Division.
Are you confident in your ability to fulfill that duty?
Of course I am! 
I’m trying my best.
I’m not sure…
Of course I am! 
I will protect Tokyo and everyone in the Flower Division… This I promise!
Well said, Ogami. That's what makes you captain of the Flower Division. 
I’m trying my best, sir…
Believe in yourself, Ogami. 
Your actions…<br>Your words…<br>They will give confidence to everyone else.
I want to, but I’m not sure I can…
...Ogami. Your words and actions will give everyone confidence.
I know you can do it. Believe in yourself, Ogami.
... 
Well, I'm sure it's hard to come up with a definitive answer right now. 
That said, I know you can do it.
Restoring peace by sacrificing one's own life…
The way Kazuma Shinguji sacrificed himself… Back then, that was our only option. 
But, you all are different. You can protect peace with your own power.
You don't need to rely on the Regalia. 
Ogami, please tell this to Sakura. 
We don't need the Pandemonium Regalia... 
And we won't need her Power of Purification. 
As long as we combine our own strength, there's nothing to fear… Please, tell her that.
... 
I understand. 
But I... 
I understand. 
But I... 
Keep it together, Ogami. 
Only you can save Sakura from her doubt and pain... 
... 
Come, Ogami. Won’t you speak to her?
...OK.
... 
Ogami, please go to her.
Only you can save Sakura from her doubt and pain... 
... 
Please, Ogami. Talk to Sakura.
...OK.
Right, then… I’ll go have a talk with Sakura.
Thank you, Ogami. We’re counting on you.
Sakura... 
Ogami... 
If I use the Power of Purification, I could purge this evil from Tokyo… Peace would finally return…
No one would have to suffer or get hurt anymore…
If I sacrifice just myself, it'll all be over and people will smile again... 
Sakura... 
But... 
I… I can’t go yet! I don’t want to die!
I want to live like a normal girl and be with the people I love! I want to stay here with everyone! 
Ogami… Does that make me selfish?
Sakura... 
Embrace her. 
Sakura! 
Ogami... 
Sakura. 
Ogami! Ogamiii!! 
Sakura... 
... 
Sakura, you're not going to die alone. I won't let it happen. 
This Regalia has been the source of all kinds of suffering, time and time again. 
If it's gone, no one will be able to use its power. Neither for good or for evil.
That's why... I'm going to destroy it! 
Huh?! Ogami... 
I can still protect everyone, even without relying on this thing's power! 
I can protect Tokyo, protect its people's happiness, and I will protect you, Sakura. 
Ogami... 
Ogami! 
S-Sakura... 
Ogami, please! Hold me tight and don't let go! 
If you don't, I... I don't know what I'll do! I feel like I might die!! 
... 
Everything's going to be all right, Sakura. You don't have to suffer anymore. 
I've made up my mind. I'm going to destroy the Regalia! 
Huh?! O-Ogami?! 
This Regalia has been the source of all kinds of suffering, time and time again. 
I can still protect everyone, even without relying on this thing's power! 
I can protect Tokyo, protect its people's happiness, and I will protect you, Sakura. 
Ogami... 
Ogami... 
Sakura, there's no need to worry. 
The more I think about it… The Regalia’s mere existence has caused so much bloodshed…
Colonel Kazuma Shinguji... 
Cerulean Satan... No, Major Yamazaki... 
And even Ayame... 
I won't let the same thing happen to you! 
We'll protect what we love most with our own power! I'm ending this once and for all!! 
Ogamiii!! 
UWOOHHHH!!
...Aah!! 
I did it! I did it!! 
The Pandemonium Regalia... has been shattered to pieces... 
Now there's no need for you to sacrifice yourself. 
Ogami... 
Sakura...? 
Ogami... 
I... I... 
I know you did this for me, but…
Somewhere deep down, I can’t help but wonder if this was really the right thing to do!
I’m… I’m a horrible person, aren’t I? I’m so selfish!!
Sakura... 
Ogami... This is truly for the best, right? 
I'm allowed to... be together with you and everyone else, right? 
Of course you are! We don't need to be sittin' around debating it. 
Who cares about the Regalia or whatever? Non ne abbiamo bisogno!
We won’t let you play the role of the tragic heroine all on your own! 
Together, we make the Flower Division! We're not gonna let anyone get left behind. 
That's right! Come on, Sakura. Smile, smile! 
E-Everyone... 
Our fight isn't over yet. 
Yes. She's right, Sakura. 
Sakura... 
We're doing this together!
We will protect the peace!
Come on, we're doing this together! We're all part of the Flower Division. 
Yes! 
I have my friends! I have the Flower Division with me! I'm not hesitating any longer! 
Sakura... 
OK... Board the Soaring Whale! Our destination is Akasaka. We're heading to the Society's base!
We're not fighting with the Pandemonium Regalia or the Power of Purification. We'll use our own power. 
This time, we'll protect the peace with our own strength! 
Roger! 
I'll fight with you! So that we may achieve true peace! 
Yeah! That's the spirit, Sakura! 
OK... Board the Soaring Whale! Our destination is Akasaka. We're heading to the Society's base! 
Ogami, I'm not hesitating any longer. 
I have everyone. Everyone in the Flower Division, my friends! 
For their sake... and for the sake of peace, I'll give it my all! 
OK... Board the Soaring Whale! Our destination is Akasaka. We're heading to the Society's base!
All right, we’re approaching Akasaka airspace.
The Black Demon Society's base... Where could it even be? 
We just received a transmission from Kayama. 
According to the Moon Division’s investigation, there’s a large tunnel network below Akasaka.
It appears that their headquarters lies at its deepest point.
The Soaring Whale will be unable to aid us while we're underground. This may be a difficult battle.
Per the Moon Division’s intel, you should be able to infiltrate through a rear entrance.
It may be a bit of a detour, but the rear won’t be as heavily guarded.
Otherwise, we could rush through the frontlines, where enemy forces are the most concentrated.
Now, Ogami. Please decide our plan of attack. 
The Infiltration plan.
The frontal assault plan.
We'll sneak around the back. I'd like to choose the least dangerous option. 
Understood. We'll direct the Soaring Whale to that location. 
We'll go with a frontal assault. Even if there are more enemies, we can break through with the Tenbu. 
Understood. We'll direct the Soaring Whale to that location. 
We're counting on you, Ogami! 
Assault Troupe, move out!
We’re going to win this!
Imperial Assault Troupe, move out! Our target is the Society's base under Akasaka! 
Roger! 
Bring it on, Black Demon Society! This will be our last fight! 
This will be our final battle. Everyone… We’re going to win this!
Yeaaah!! 
Bring it on! We'll show the Society the might of the Imperial Assault Troupe's Flower Division!
... 
Everyone… I don’t have anything special to say.
I trust in our power, so have faith and fight on! 
Yeaaah!! 
Sorry, Ogami. I can only sell you one photo per month. 
I see. That's too bad. 
So sorry, Mr. Ogami, but each customer is only allowed to purchase one photo at a time.
Oh, really? That's too bad.
