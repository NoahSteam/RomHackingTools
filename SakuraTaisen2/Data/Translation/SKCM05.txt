All right… Which number should I dial?
Good afternoon. <br> It's time for Capital News.
Today, the Fukagawa Police held a conference regarding the fire that broke out at the Murasame restaurant.
They determined that last month’s fire was a case of arson carried out by an unknown party.
The Navy Minister Yamaguchi was found to have been visiting the restaurant at the time of the incident.
Therefore, the police plan to investigate the possibility that the arson was politically motivated.
For today’s “Summer Tourist Resort,” we are going to spotlight the Izu Peninsula.
Izu has sea, mountains, and hot springs, which makes it a must-go destination for the holiday.
Why not try visiting the peninsula this summer?
Next, we're going to feature this week's cultural corner. 
The Assault Troupe will be performing their autumn production of “The Blue Bird” next month.
This production will mark the first appearance of the international star, Reni Milchstraße. 
Milchstraße joined the troupe in May and this play will mark the performer’s theatrical debut in Japan.
Even if you are not a fan of the troupe, you may want to see what kind of performance this will be.
Finally, it's time for this week's weather forecast. 
The hot summer weather will likely continue due to a high-pressure system from the Pacific. 
As the summer holiday begins, people are sure to flock to tourist spots in order to cool down.
Sumida River and Mikasa Memorial Park are already packed with visitors.
Please be careful not to get exhausted from the summer heat, and have a nice holiday. 
That's it for Capital News, brought to you by the Capital Daily Report. 
That concludes today's broadcast. We hope you will look forward to tomorrow's programming.
