The battle's over, everyone. We saved the Mikasa.
Yeah! Good job, Mon Frère!
The Mikasa managed to pull through somehow.
It should be smooth sailing from here on out.
Now it's just a straight shot to Musashi!
I cannot allow that.
You're… Tsuchigumo?!
You're here again?! <br> How persistent you are!
I'm under orders from Lord Kyogoku to bring down this ship.
And that's exactly what I'll do… Even if I have to take you all down with me!
Y-You'll what?!
Cease this at once. You're only being used by Kyogoku.
I know well that I am nothing but a sacrificial pawn.
But I don't care… As long as I get to kill every last one of you rotten humans!
For the sake of the true capital that Lord Kyogoku will create… I'll run this ship into the ground!
