Back to dismantling this bomb. The inside of this thing has wires wrapped around all over the place…
Ah! There's a control panel. I'll need to do something to the wires connected to it…
That reminds me, those numbers… If I cut the numbered wires in that same order, that might work.
If I remember right, the first number was…
"2," right?
"3," right?
"4," right?
I'm pretty sure it was "2"… All right, let's try cutting wire number 2.
OK, next was…
I'm pretty sure it was "3"… All right, let's try cutting wire number 3.
OK, next was…
I'm pretty sure it was "4"… All right, let's try cutting wire number 4.
OK, next was…
Hmmm… I totally forgot what it was. I'll just have to cut one at random.
OK, next was…
"8," right?
"9," right?
"10," right?
I think it was "8." <br> Let's try cutting wire number 8… All right, how was that?!
I think it was "9." <br> Let's try cutting wire number 9… All right, how was that?!
I think it was "10." <br> Let's try cutting wire number 10… All right, how was that?!
Crap, I can't remember. Maybe it was… this one? All right, how was that?!
OK, the bomb's been defused. We ought to be safe so long as nothing hits the explosives themselves.
Orihime's waiting on the other side of this wall….
Break the wall!
Time to tear this wall down! Hold on Orihime, I'm coming!
Hyaaaah!!
Is breaking this wall really such a good idea…?
Well there's no time. Here I come, Orihime!!
Hyaaaah!!
Huh? <br> Nothing happened.
Did I get something wrong? What should I do?
OK, let's take this thing apart already! Let's see, uh… What's this in the back…
Whoa! It's shooting out steam! Is that from the part I broke earlier? I've gotta stop it!
Press the blue lever.
Press the red lever.
Press a random lever.
Ugh, it stopped. I can't really see anything now. I might've gone just a little bit overboard…
But there's no time to waste. I have to save Orihime. Gotta keep dismantling this bomb.
Ugh, it stopped. I might've gone a little overboard after all…
Ah! That's the bomb's control panel! Thank goodness I acted quickly!
Now that I know where that is, I can force the door open!
Break the wall!
Time to tear this wall down! Hold on Orihime, I'm coming!
Hyaaaah!!
Is breaking this wall really such a good idea…?
Well there's no time. Here I come, Orihime!!
Hyaaaah!!
Ugh, it stopped. I can't really see anything now. I might've gone just a little bit overboard…
But there's no time to waste. I have to save Orihime. Gotta keep dismantling this bomb.
Whoa! I can't see anything! I can't do anything like this.
I'll have to wait for the steam to clear up before I try again.
There's no time left to waste…
Back to dismantling this bomb. The inside of this thing has wires wrapped around all over the place…
Ah! There's a control panel. I'll need to do something to the wires connected to it…
I have no idea what any of this is, but there's no time. I'll just have to go for it.
Cut wire number 2.
Cut wire number 3.
Cut wire number 4.
Let's cut wire number 2. <br> OK, here goes.
All right, one more ought to do it.
Let's cut wire number 3. <br> OK, here goes.
All right, one more ought to do it.
Let's cut wire number 4. <br> OK, here goes.
All right, one more ought to do it.
Hmm… I can't keep waffling over this, I'll just have to cut one at random.
All right, one more ought to do it.
Cut wire number 8.
Cut wire number 9.
Cut wire number 10.
Let's cut wire number 8. <br> OK, here goes… <br> All right, how's that?!
Let's cut wire number 9. <br> OK, here goes… <br> All right, how's that?!
Let's cut wire number 10. <br> OK, here goes… <br> All right, how's that?!
Damn, I'll just have to go with my gut! All right, how's that?!
Oh, looks like that worked. We ought to be safe so long as nothing hits the explosives themselves.
Orihime's waiting on the other side of this wall….
Break the wall!
Time to tear this wall down! Hold on Orihime, I'm coming!
Hyaaaah!!
Is breaking this wall really such a good idea…?
Well there's no time. Here I come, Orihime!!
Hyaaaah!!
H-Huh? Nothing happened. Well, I guess I DID just act totally at random.
I'll have to give it another look. Here we go again…
