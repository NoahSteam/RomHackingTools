Is this… Is this the army hospital Mr. Yoneda was taken to?!
…Ogami. Mr. Yoneda is safe now, isn’t he?
Mr. Yoneda can’t die… There’s no way that could happen, right?! 
… 
…We should hurry. We don't have a moment to lose.
Ah, Saki! 
Everyone… 
Saki! What’s Mr. Yoneda’s condition?!
I’m afraid his condition is… critical. 
By some miracle, he’s managed to hold onto his life, but… it seems he’s fallen comatose…
…Oh no!! 
Uncle was talking with me just this morning…
He told me he was going to mail my letter… He was so cheerful! 
Uwaaaaah! Uncle Yoneda!! 
…Who in the world shot him?! 
That's… still unknown. All we're certain of is that he was shot in front of the ministry building.
Forgive me… To think something like this would happen while I was with him… 
…Anyway, let’s go see how he’s doing. 
…Agreed. 
Mr. Yoneda! <br> Ichiro Ogami, reporting in. 
...!! 
Mr. Yoneda! 
Uncle! Uncle Yonedaaaa! 
According to the doctor… The likelihood of him regaining consciousness is… close to zero.
N-No… 
Uwaaaaaah! <br> Uncle! Uncle!! 
… 
… 
Mr. Yoneda… 
Sorry Ogami, but customers are only allowed to purchase one of each bromide. 
I see. That's too bad. 
So sorry, Mr. Ogami, but customers are only allowed to purchase one of each bromide.
