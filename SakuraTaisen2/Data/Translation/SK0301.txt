So, this... This is the hospital Mr. Yoneda was sent to, right? 
Ogami, Mr. Yoneda is safe now, right? 
Mr. Yoneda can't die now, he couldn't be, could he? 
... 
Anyway, let's hurry. We're racing against time. 
Ah, Saki! 
Everyone... 
Saki! How is Mr. Yoneda right now? 
He's in... critical condition. 
For now, he's stable and his vitals have gotten better, but he's currently in a coma. 
...Oh no!! 
Uncle was just talking with me this morning... 
He said that he was going to send my letter out... He was so cheerful! 
Uwaaaaah! Uncle Yoneda!! 
Who shot him!? 
We haven't been able to figure that out yet. The only thing we know for sure was that he was shot in front of the Army Ministry building. 
Forgive me... To think this happened while I was out with him. 
...Anyway, let's see how things look. 
...Agreed. 
Mr. Yoneda! Ichiro Ogami, reporting in. 
...!! 
Mr. Yoneda! 
Uncle! Uncleee Yoneda! 
The doctor told me that... the possibility of him regaining consciousness is close to zero. 
N-No... 
Uwaaaaaah! Uncle! Uncle!! 
... 
... 
Mr. Yoneda... 
Sorry Ogami, but each customer is only allowed to purchase one photo at a time. 
I see. That's too bad... 
I'm sorry, Ogami. I can only sell you one piece at a time to a customer. 
Oh, really? That's too bad...
