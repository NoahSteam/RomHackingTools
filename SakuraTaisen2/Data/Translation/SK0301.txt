Is this... Is this the military hospital Mr. Yoneda was taken to?!
Ogami... Mr. Yoneda is all right, isn't he?
Mr. Yoneda won't die, right? There's no way he can, right?! 
... 
Anyway, let's hurry. We don't have a moment to lose.
Ah, Saki! 
Everyone... 
Saki! What's Yoneda's condition?!
He's in... critical condition. 
By some miracle, he's managed to hold onto his life, but... it seems he's fallen comatose...
...Oh no!! 
Uncle was talking with me just this morning...
He told me he was going to mail my letter... He was so cheerful! 
Uwaaaaah! Uncle Yoneda!! 
...Who in the world shot him?! 
That's... still unknown. All we're certain of is that he was shot in front of the Ministry building.
Forgive me... To think something like this would happen while I was with him... 
...Anyway, let's go see how he's doing. 
...Agreed. 
Mr. Yoneda! Ichiro Ogami, reporting in. 
...!! 
Mr. Yoneda! 
Uncle! Uncleee Yoneda! 
According to the doctor... The likelihood of him regaining consciousness is... close to zero.
N-No... 
Uwaaaaaah! Uncle! Uncle!! 
... 
... 
Mr. Yoneda... 
Sorry Ogami, but each customer is only allowed to purchase one photo at a time. 
I see. That's too bad... 
I'm sorry, Ogami. I can only sell you one piece at a time to a customer. 
Oh, really? That's too bad...
