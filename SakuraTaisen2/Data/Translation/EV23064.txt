Out of my way, Kanna!
Say what?! YOU get outta MY way! You might hurt me with all those spikes, ya damn cactus woman!
And YOU might damage MY Koubu by ramming that lumbering body of yours into it!
Honestly, this is absurd, we need to be on the same page at a time like this!
Heh, you think I don't know that?! We don't have time to talk smack!
I mean, with enemies this strong, we both need all the help we can get…
And I figure you're still more help than most other people… So c'mon, lend me a hand!
…Hmhm, you'd better not slow me down, then!
Yeah, yeah, keep talkin'!
