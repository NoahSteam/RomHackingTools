All your allies have fallen, Demon King. Your ambitions end hereºÅ
We exist only to fulfill our master's ambitions. You could say we are his toolsÖ
Öand he has no need of tools that have lost their usefulness. I will carry out his wishes on my own.
Then, you all were behind the coup d'etat? Just what did you hope to achieve by instigating such a thing?!
That was little more than a distraction. We took advantage of the mayhem to retrieve the Regalia from the theater.
Our true objective was to seal the power of purificationÖ and in that, we have succeeded!
Tch, so that's all it was to youÖ You'll pay for this, Demon King!!
