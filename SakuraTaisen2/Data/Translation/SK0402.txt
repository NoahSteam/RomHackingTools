Ahh, so that's what happened, eh?
Guess that means that starting today, we've got our own little doggy!
Yaaay, yaaay! <br> We've got a new friend!
Arf, arf!
We should come up with a name for this little pup.
Yeah. Looks like he's a boy, so I wonder what sort of name would be best…
We oughta name him somethin' manly, so he'll grow up nice an' strong.
Whaaat?! <br> No, let's pick a cute name!
Ogami, how about you ask everyone for their opinions and then decide for us?
We're counting on you.
Why don't we call him "Shiro"?
It means white, and he has such beautiful white fur, after all. I think it fits perfectly.
I think Shiro is a great name.
OK, Let's go with Shiro.
Let me think it over.
You're dressed for summer.
OK, Let's go with Shiro.
Let me think it over.
OK, let's go with Shiro. His fur is the first thing you see when you look at him, so it suits him well.
You think so? <br> I'm glad to hear that.
All right, it's decided, then! Welcome to the team, Shiro!
Arf, arf! Woof!
Let me think on it a bit longer. If we’re giving him a name, I want to be sure it's a good one.
Sure. Go find out what the others think and decide on a nice name for him.
You're also dressed in your summer outfit, aren't you, Sakura.
Yes, and I was really pleased to hear you liked it, Ogami.
Ooh, what's up? <br> Did something happen with you and the chief?
Heheh. <br> That’s… a… secret. <br> Right, Ogami?
Uh, y-yeah.
That summer dress looks great on you.
I thought you said you preferred my usual outfit.
Uh… I mean…
Haha, I'm just kidding. Thanks for saying so.
What do you think, Ogami? Does it suit me?
Yeah, you look fantastic wearing that, Sakura.
Th-Thank you. I'm happy to hear… that you think it looks good.
You didn't say anything earlier, so I felt kind of nervous.
How nice, Sakura. He said it looks good on you.
Looking at this dog, a name springs to mind right away.
Oh, what’s that?
"Hanamaru." It has an elegant lilt to it, yes?
It means “flower circle.” Very appropriate for a new member of the Flower Division, wouldn’t you say?
Indeed, any other name is simply unthinkable. Don't you agree, Ensign?
OK, let's go with Hanamaru.
Let me think it over.
Your outfit looks nice.
OK, let's go with Hanamaru.
Let me think it over.
OK, let's go with Hanamaru. You're right Sumire, it's a really fitting name.
Ohohoho! <br> I knew that I could count upon you to have good sense in names, Ensign!
All right, then it's decided. This pup's name will be Hanamaru.
Let's get along, Hanamaru.
Arf, arf! Woof!
Let me think on it a bit longer. If we’re giving him a name, I want to be sure it's a good one.
Consider it as long as you must. I'm certain you will realize that my name is the best choice.
I don't know too much about clothing, but I think your summer outfit looks nice.
Ensign! Have you not said the exact same thing to each one of us?!
Uh… S-Sorry.
Heavens, what a tremendously rude way to treat a lady!
Ensign… My deepest thanks.
You certainly do have good taste. How delightful.
Well, I think "Dai" would be a good name for 'im.
He's just a lil' guy, but if we name him Dai like the word for big, he'll surely grow big and strong.
I think my name suits him best.
OK, let's go with Dai.
Let me think it over.
Your outfit looks cool.
OK, let's go with Dai.
Let me think it over.
Dai is a great name, if you ask me. I'm sure he'll grow into a big, healthy dog.
Heheh, you think so too, Boss? This lil' guy's got a lot of potential, I'm sure of it.
Looks like you've got a name, Dai. And it's a good one, too!
Arf, arf, arf!!
Let me think on it a bit longer. If we’re giving him a name, I want to be sure it's a good one.
Take your time and don't rush it. He's gonna carry whatever name we give 'im his whole life, after all.
By the way, Kanna… <br> That's not your usual karate gi, is it? It looks good on you, though.
C-C'mon, Boss, what're you talkin' about? Let's come up with a name for this lil' guy first!
Heavens, Kanna, your face has turned the brightest shade of red. Whatever could be the matter?
Gimme a break, Sumire! The boss is over here sayin' all this weird stuff, that's all.
I thought of a name too, Mon Frère.
How about "Torte"? Wouldn't it be so cute to name him after something sweet?
Come on, let's call him Torte. Look, he's even wagging his tail! So I'm sure he likes it, too.
OK, let’s go with Torte.
Let me think it over.
Your outfit suits you.
OK, let's go with Torte.
Let me think it over.
OK, let's go with Torte, then.
Really? Hoorayyy!!
It's nice to meet you, Torte. This is my bear, Jean-Paul. I hope you'll be friends with him.
What a cute name you've been given, Torte!
Arf, arf! Woof!
I see… I'm going to give some thought to the other names, too.
Aww, you don't wanna use Torte? But I think it's a good name…
I see you've changed into your summer clothes as well, Iris.
Hee hee, I knew you'd notice, Mon Frère! So you think it looks good on me, right? Right?
Yeah, it does. It's such a cute outfit, it suits you perfectly.
Eheheh… Thanks, Mon Frère.
I had a hunch things might end up like this, so I thought up a name on the way back from the hospital.
And that name is "Long"! It's the Chinese word for dragon.
He's just a little squirt, but we want him to grow big enough to stretch toward the heavens, like a dragon…
That's the feel I was going for, anyway. Sounds awesome, right?!
So, whaddaya think of Long? I think it's pretty great, myself.
OK, let’s go with Long.
Let me think it over.
Is that your summer outfit?
OK, let’s go with Long.
Let me think it over.
OK, let's go with Long. A dragon big enough to reach the heavens… Yeah, it's a great name.
That's what I'm talking about! You always seem to get me, Chief.
Come here, Long!
Arf, arf, arf!!
Yaaay! He knows when we say his name!
Arf, arf!!
Let me think on it a bit longer. I might decide to go with a different name.
Sure thing. <br> Think it over real good.
Is that your summer outfit? It looks really good on you.
Huh? If you're talking about this old thing, it's what I always wear. Did you hit your head or something?
Well, it's just that when I take a closer look at it, I feel like it really does suit you perfectly.
Aww, Chief… <br> Butter me up all you want, it won't get you anywhere.
Let me see… What do you think of "Altair"?
It is the name of one of the stars from the legend of Tanabata. In Japan you call the star "Hikoboshi."
Now is the season for the Tanabata festival, so I'm thinking this name is very timely.
Altair… It's such a romantic, mysterious name.
OK, let's go with Altair.
Let me think it over.
Your outfit looks nice.
OK, let's go with Altair.
Let me think it over.
OK, let's go with Altair! From the star Hikoboshi… "Orihime" is the other star in Tanabata, so it matches.
That's true. And Altair is such a mighty-sounding name, too.
How about that, Altair? Since I have given you the name of my partner star…
You must grow up into a splendid dog. Do you understand?
Arf, arf, arf!!
I wonder if any of the other names would be better… I'm going to think on it a bit longer.
Mamma mia, Japanese men are so indecisive.
I thought something seemed different, but it looks as though you've just changed into a summer dress.
Wh-Why do you say this, all of the sudden?!
I don't know much of anything about clothes, but I like it a lot.
I-Is that right…?
Your face is sooo red, Orihime! If you're happy, you should just say so!
How very rare to see her looking so flustered.
I-I am not flustered even in the least!
Mamma mia, it was only because Mr. Ensign said such a strange thing. Just forget it!
Hmph. This is why I hate Japanese men. They are all so insincere.
Insincere? That wasn't my intention at all…
You've gone around and told all of us how nice we look, have you not?
How am I to believe anyone so loose with his words?
I see… I'm sorry. I guess it was pretty thoughtless of me.
Reni, have you thought of any good names for him?
…
Anything is fine. Just tell me the first name that comes to mind.
…Hund.
Hund?
The German word for dog.
Hmm…
…Any moniker will do, Hund is just one option.
OK, let's go with Hund.
Let me think it over.
Your outfit looks nice.
OK, let's go with Hund.
Let me think it over.
All right, let's go with Hund since you took the time to come up with it.
…
Still, naming a dog "Dog" doesn't sound quite right, does it?
Whaddya mean? Kohran here gives her weird machines all kinds of weird names.
And those are at least a hundred times more weird than this, right?
What’s the big idea, dragging me through the mud here?!
Hmph, it's a fine name, Hund. I hope we become good friends.
Arf, arf! Woof!
Hmm, it's not quite fitting… Maybe I'll go with something else.
…
Oh, that looks like a nice, cool outfit. It suits you pretty well.
…
How nice, Reni! Mon Frère thinks you look cute.
I see… Then I am pleased.
Ever the stoic, aren't you, Reni?
Based on Japan's typical temperature and humidity, this clothing provides the most maneuverability.
O-OK…
Ogami, please pick a good name for this pup.
Hey, Chief, are you gonna run off without giving this poor doggy a name?
Mon Frère, what should we name the puppy?!
Ogami, please pick a good name for this pup.
Oh, it looks like<br>
<sp>likes his name,<br>too.
Since we've decided on a name for the dog, why don't we disperse for the time being?
In that case, I will be found in the music room, playing on the piano.
I think I might take a bath and then do some sword training in the courtyard.
Guess we're gonna get going, then. Later, Boss.
Well then… I've got some time until dinner. I guess I'll wander around the theater.
Hey, Chief, do you have a second?
What is it, Kohran? <br> You sound serious.
There's something I wanna bend your ear about. Mind coming to my room at 4 o'clock?
Sure, I'll be there.
Sorry… <br> I'm a bit busy.
Why not right now?
Sure, I'll be there. Your room, 4 o'clock. Got it.
Thank you kindly! I knew you'd come through for me.
Then I'll be waiting for you in my room at 4. Later gator!
Sorry… I'm a bit busy right now.
Y'know, I never said it had to be right now.
C'mon Chief, don't give me the cold shoulder like that. I just need you an hour from now.
Hmm… I see. In that case, I'll come to your room at 4.
Alrighty. Then I'll be waiting for you, Chief!
You want to talk? <br> Why not right now?
That's a no-go. I'll be busy for at least the next hour, that's why I asked.
I see. In that case, I'll head to your room at 4.
Sorry, I hope asking that doesn't make me sound too big-headed. Anyway, I'll be waiting in my room at 4!
…
Still with me, Chief?
Oh, uh, sorry. <br> Um… What were you saying?
…Listen.
I wanna talk to you about something, so I need you to meet me at my room at 4 o'clock.
R-Right, I got it. <br> 4 o'clock, I'll be there.
I'll be waiting in my room then. Later gator!
She asked that I come to her room… I wonder what Kohran wants to talk about.
If I'm meeting her at 4, then I've got an hour to kill. Guess I'll find something to do until then.
Oh, it's Reni.
Hey, Reni. <br> Nice weather, huh?
…
So, uh… Are you getting some sunbathing in?
…
(Shoot. I don't know how to keep the conversation going.)
Arf, arf!
Hey,<sp>
!
Arf, arf!
<sp>looks like he<br>wants to play with you, Reni.
Arf!
…
Reni…
Go play with Shiro.
Go play with Hanamaru.
Go play with Dai.
Go play with Torte.
Go play with Long.
Go play with Altair.
Go play with Hund.
Do you dislike dogs?
Why not play with<br>
<sp>since he's here,<br>Reni?
<sp>seems eager to<br>play with you, too.
Arf, arf!
…I would prefer to avoid any excessive movement.
Do you dislike dogs, Reni?
Not particularly…
Arf, arf!
…
Arf, arf!
Just look how much<sp>
<br>wants to play with you, Reni.
You could at least give him a pat on the head.
…
Well, there is somewhere I must be…
Ah, Reni!
Shoot, too late.
Whiiine…
There there,<sp>
.<br>I'm sure Reni will come<br>around eventually.
Oh my, Ensign…
Arf, arf!
Hi, Sumire. Were you and<br>
<sp>playing just now?
Yes. My family kept a dog once, when I was younger.
Although he was quite a bit larger than this fellow, he made an excellent playmate.
Well then<sp>
, let us<br>play again another time.
Arf, arf!
I wish Reni would play with you, too.
I should also get going.<br>See you later,<sp>
.
Woof!
Arf!
Hey there,<sp>
.<br>How do you like the theater so far?
Arf, arf!
Hahaha. I wonder what you're saying? It's almost like you can understand me.
Anyway, I should be off.<br>See you later,<sp>
.
Woof!
Hey, Sakura.
Ah, Ogami.
Hm? What happened to the summer dress you had on earlier?
I'm just about to start my sword training, so I got changed.
It turns out my traditional clothing is better at getting me in the right frame of mind for training.
Hahaha… <br> Yeah, I see what you mean.
I know! Would you like to train with me, Ogami?
Sure, let's do it!
No thanks, sounds tiring.
Sure, let's do it! I ought to get some exercise occasionally.
Really? I'd appreciate it.
OK, I'll teach you what to do as we go. Now, let's get started!
I think I got some good training in thanks to you. Thank you so much, Ogami.
I'm glad I could help out.
I'm going to keep it up for a while longer.
I see. In that case, I'll be on my way.
You did great!
Thank you so much for training with me today, Ogami.
Sure. I'm glad I could help you out.
I'm going to keep it up for a while longer.
I see. In that case, I'll be on my way.
You did great!
S-Sorry… I guess I wasn't much help after all.
No, it's fine. It's enough that you wanted to help me train in the first place.
If you have the time, I'd be happy to train with you again another day.
When that time comes, I promise I'll try a little harder.
Sure!
Well, I'm going to keep it up for a while longer.
I see. In that case, I'll be on my way.
You did great!
No thanks, sounds tiring.
Is that so… <br> Well, I'm going to keep it up for a while longer.
I see. In that case, I'll be on my way.
All right, we'll do this together, Ogami.
I'll teach you what to do as we go. Now, let's get started!
Looks like Sakura is still training with her sword.
I don't want to get in her way, so I'll go somewhere else.
Huh. Is that Sumire?
Ah, Ensign.
Hey, Sumire. What are you up to?
Why, I was only recalling our performance of the summer production the other day.
It has been far too long since I stood in the spotlight onstage…
The thunder of applause from the audience ringing in my ears… There is no feeling quite like it.
I feel as though I was born to be an actress…
Being onstage is where I find my bliss…
You're absolutely right.
The role fit you perfectly.
Keep up the hard work.
You're absolutely right. The way you returned to us and jumped right back onstage…
And that scene you shared with Kanna… It was fantastic. I'd expect no less from you, Sumire.
Hohoho… You understand me so well, Ensign.
It's simply my talent at work. This is what a true star looks like!
You really were perfect for the role of Goneril, if you ask me.
The scene where you give Kanna's King Lear a hard time felt so true to life!
Excuse me? Are you saying that was anything less than my acting on display?
Gah… N-No, that's not what I…
Besides, the part was the only thing I was unsatisfied with.
Why was I not given the lead role? It's beyond my understanding!
What a terrible shame for those fans who loyally awaited my return.
R-Right…
Keep up the hard work. I'll be in the crowd, cheering you on.
My, Ensign. Such kind words, but they are unneeded.
Talent like mine hardly requires such things as "hard work" or "effort."
R-Right…
In the first place, it's careless to believe our hard work only happens in front of the audience.
I believe that hard work is something which happens behind the scenes, each and every day.
I see…
…You've gone rather quiet all of a sudden. Is there something the matter?
Uh… I was just, um… Thinking of how to respond.
You know, Ensign, it is important to keep pace in conversations.
If you cannot respond in a timely manner during a dialogue, you're not fit to converse with a lady.
R-Right. Sorry.
In any case, I'm really relieved to have you back with us again, Sumire.
Goodness, I did tell you during our last correspondence that I would return shortly, didn't I?
Besides, there is never truly a dull moment here at the theater.
Sumire…
I should be on my way, as it is time for me to take my tea.
Have a lovely day, Ensign.
She may have brushed it off, but I'm sure she must be happy to be back, too.
Well… I ought to get going, myself.
There's no one onstage. It doesn't look like rehearsal has begun yet.
Oh well. Guess I'll go someplace else.
Oh, Ogami. Do you need something?
You came here to listen to my gossip, right, Ogami?
It's nice to see you again, Ogami.
If you're interested in hearing more gossip, I'm all out. Sorry.
I see, that's too bad.
I'll have some more interesting tidbits to share another time, so look forward to it!
Hey, Yuri and Kasumi.
Oh, hello, Ogami. Is there something you need?
I've got plenty of new, juicy gossip for you. Ask away!
Welcome, Ogami! Would you like to buy something?
Buy a bromide.
Talk to Tsubaki.
Leave.
Could I take a look at the portraits for sale?
Sorry, Ogami. I can only sell one bromide at a time.
Please understand, we need to keep some for the customers.
You want to buy a bromide? Please, take your pick!
That's a bromide of Sakura.
Let's see… <br> Sakura's bromide, right?
That’ll be 50 sen. <br> Thanks for your patronage!
That's a bromide of Sumire.
Let's see… <br> Sumire's bromide, right?
That’ll be 50 sen. <br> Thanks for your patronage!
That's a bromide of Maria.
Let's see… <br> Maria's bromide, right?
That’ll be 50 sen. <br> Thanks for your patronage!
That's a bromide of Kanna.
Let's see… <br> Kanna's bromide, right?
That’ll be 50 sen. <br> Thanks for your patronage!
That's a bromide of Iris.
Let's see… <br> Iris's bromide, right?
That’ll be 50 sen. <br> Thanks for your patronage!
That's a bromide of Kohran.
Let's see… <br> Kohran's bromide, right?
That’ll be 50 sen. <br> Thanks for your patronage!
That's a bromide of Orihime.
Let's see… <br> Orihime's bromide, right?
That’ll be 50 sen. <br> Thanks for your patronage!
That’s a bromide of Reni.
Let's see… Reni's bromide, right?
That’ll be 50 sen. <br> Thanks for your patronage!
Oh, so you're not going to buy anything?
Oh yeah, you brought back that super cute little doggy earlier, didn't you?
I guess he lives here at the theater with us now, huh?
Yes, that’s right.<br>His name is<sp>
<br>if I remember right.
<sp>of the Flower<br>Division! What an adorable name!
Would it be OK if I played with him after I'm done working?
Yeah, of course. <br> I bet he'll really take a liking to you, Tsubaki.
…<br>Ooh, I can’t wait to play with him!
Well, I should be going. Keep up the good work.
Thank you very much! <br> Come back again soon!
Thank you very much! <br> Come back and buy another bromide next month!
Hmm, it looks like the door to the manager's office was left open.
Is someone inside?
Oh, Saki, it's you. What're you doing in here?
Ogami…
I thought I would organize some of these documents while Mr. Yoneda is gone.
But never mind that. You know, we're completely alone in here right now…
So… kiss me.
Eep!! Wh-What?!
Please, hurry.
Kiss her.
Run away.
Kiss her.
Run away.
Scold her.
O-OK then, if you want me to, then…
Ogami…
…
(…Huh? I don't feel anything.)
…Saki?
Hmmhmm, you were being serious, then? Oh, Ogami, you're so adorable.
Huh? Saki, where'd you go?
Umm… I think she just pulled a fast one on me.
Tch, forget it. No point in sticking around here, so I'm gonna leave.
S-Sorry! I've… got to go!
Ogami!
Phew. I wonder if I ran far enough.
Still, why in the world would she suddenly up and ask me something like that?
Saki, do you have any idea what you're asking me?!
Begging me to kiss you in the manager's office while he's in the hospital… It's completely shameless!
Oh dear, you're even cute when you're angry.
Don't take things so seriously. Isn't that what Yoneda himself always says? So come now, hurry…
I can't deal with this any longer. Excuse me!
Good grief. I wonder if I got far enough away.
But anyway, why in the world would she suddenly up and ask me something like that?
Hmmhmm, scared, aren't you? Then I'll start us off…
(It… It would be really bad if anyone saw this!)
S-Sorry! I've… got to go!
Ogami!
Phew. I wonder if I ran far enough.
Still, why in the world would she suddenly up and ask me something like that?
Saki is gone. I'm not sure whether to be relieved or disappointed…
OK, enough of these stupid thoughts, Ogami. Time to go somewhere else.
Hi, Orihime.
…
I have not a thing to say to you, Mr. Ensign! Please excuse me!
Oh man… She certainly was angry with me.
Oh well. Guess I'll head elsewhere.
Oh Mr. Ensign, it's you.
What're you doing in here?
I am relaxing and stretching out my legs for a moment.
This "tatami" had me surprised at first, but I have come to like it very much.
You've gotten used to it?
You were skeptical before.
I guess you've steadily gotten accustomed to life here, then?
I'm a bit relieved to see that. There's nothing better than being at ease where you live.
This theater IS a little cramped, but also rather cozy at the same time.
And you were so skeptical of it being made of grass before…
I think anyone would be surprised to hear that the floor is made of grass!
Hahaha, I was just teasing you.
When I heard it was grass, my first thought was whether there were bugs inside of it…
I didn't imagine it would feel this nice on your feet.
In any case, I'm happy to hear you like the tatami.
Yes, though that is not the case with Japanese men.
I will be going now, if you please.
Oh, come on… I guess nothing's changed on that front.
This has basically become the "party room" as of late…
But thankfully, it's back to being used for its original purpose because of the King Lear performances.
Hi, Orihime.
Oh, Mr. Ensign. As always, you seem to have very much free time on your hands.
I-I guess. Anyway, are you practicing the piano?
It is not practice. I am training my creativity.
Discerning one sound from another, technical skill, concentration, and creativity…
All of these I believe are skills that carry over from music to the battlefield.
So that's it. That line of thinking feels very like you, Orihime.
Say, now! Why don't we have a test of your skills by playing for just a bit?
How do you think, Mr. Ensign? Shall we try?
Sure, let's do it.
Haha… I can't do that.
Sure, let's do it.
Well, do try your hardest not to embarrass yourself!
Haha… There's no way I can do that. I don't have any ear for music at all.
Yes, I've no doubt your abilities here amount to much at all.
But will the Flower Division's captain really be so quick to turn tail and run from a challenge?
Uh…
I suppose you can go and waste as much time as you'd like.
Unlike you, I have places where I must be. So I will excuse myself now.
With Orihime gone, I guess I've got the room to myself.
What do you say, then? <br> Will you do it or not?
…All right. <br> I'll give it a shot.
Ooh… Don't blame me if this turns out to be too much for you.
Well, do try your hardest not to embarrass yourself!
My, my… <br> A surprisingly good showing, Mr. Ensign.
Hahaha… <br> I wouldn't go that far.
I think this is what they call "beginner's luck" or "happy accident," isn't it?
I suppose it was a perfect way to kill some time.
Unlike you, I have places where I must be. So I will excuse myself now.
With Orihime gone, I guess I've got the room to myself.
Hmm… I feel like I could have tried a little harder.
I expected nothing less than mediocrity from you, Mr. Ensign.
From that standpoint at least, it was quite impressive.
Ugh…
But still, I suppose it was a perfect way to kill some time.
Unlike you, I have places where I must be. So I will excuse myself now.
With Orihime gone, I guess I've got the room to myself.
I did not expect much of you, but I never imagined you would do quite this badly…
To be frank, it is a wonder to me that you've served as Flower Division captain this long.
W-Was I really that bad?
Coming this far with as little sense as you have is an accomplishment all its own.
Well, at the very least, watching you was an amusing way to kill the time.
I will be on my way now.
Unlike you, I have places where I must be. So I will excuse myself now.
With Orihime gone, I guess I've got the room to myself.
Yep, Orihime's not here anymore.
She said she was headed somewhere else, so maybe I should go, too.
Nobody's here. Time to try another room.
Heya, Boss.
Hey, Kanna. Hmm… Something smells pretty good.
Heheheh, I'm whippin’ up Chef Kanna's Ultra-Special Menu!
It's bitter melon chanpuru, a dish we make where I'm from back on Okinawa.
You just stir-fry some bitter melon with eggs.
Sounds pretty tasty, right?!
It sure does!
Not to me…
It sure does! I bet it's nice and refreshing in the summer heat, too.
That's my Boss! I knew you'd get it!
All right, here ya go, Boss-man. Eat up!
I'm still in the middle of makin' it, but I should be finished up by around 3:30.
Come back to the cafeteria in 30 minutes or so, and I'll feed you as much as you can eat!
OK, thanks Kanna. I'll come back in a bit, then.
Come back hungry, ya hear?
I don't know… Bitter melon doesn't sound all that tasty to me.
Someone goes outta their way to tell ya about something good, and that's how ya respond?
Guess there's no accountin' for taste…
S-Sorry.
Why not try it out, just for the heck of it?
I'm still in the middle of makin' it, but I should be finished up by around 3:30.
Come back to the cafeteria in 30 minutes or so, and I'll feed you as much as you can eat!
A-All right. I may swing back around if I feel so inclined.
You may as well give it a taste! I'll be here!
Hmm, I can't decide if that would taste good or not…
Oh yeah…? All right, I'm gonna serve ya some, Boss.
I'm still in the middle of makin' it, but I should be finished up by around 3:30.
Come back to the cafeteria in 30 minutes or so, and I'll feed you as much as you can eat!
OK, thanks Kanna. I'll come back in a bit, then.
Yeah, ya better be ready for it! I promise it'll be great.
Hey, Boss. I'm still makin' that chanpuru right now.
I think it'll be done in about 30 minutes, so come back here around then.
Come back around 3:30, got it.
Yep! I'm sure that'll give your stomach enough time to make some room.
Man, it smells really good.
…I can smell it as much as I want, but that won't make it cook any faster. I better go.
Man, it smells really good.
This must be the scent of Kanna's bitter melon chanpuru.
…I can smell it as much as I want, but that won't make it cook any faster. I better go.
Yo, Boss!
Hey Kanna. I'm back and ready to eat, just like you told me.
Heheh, thanks for waitin'. Take a seat.
Hi Kanna. <br> Are you eating right now?
Yep. This is Chef Kanna's Ultra-Special Menu.
It's bitter melon chanpuru, a dish we make where I'm from back on Okinawa.
You just stir-fry some bitter melon with eggs. Sounds pretty tasty, right?!
You can have some too, if you want. Go on, take a seat!
Well, since you're offering… OK then.
Here ya go, Boss. <br> Help yourself.
Sure thing. <br> Thanks for the meal.
…Wow, this is great! I could eat bowlfuls of this!
Heheh, I knew you'd be into it! Man, I never get tired of watchin' you eat.
Say, Boss. How's about you an' me have a little eatin’ contest?
The rules are simple: whichever of us can eat three servings of food the fastest is the winner!
Sounds fun. <br> I'll take that challenge!
Bitter melon chanpuru
Rice
Tea
All right, here we go! Ready… Start!
OK… What should I grab first?
Mm, bitter melon stir-fried with eggs… So tasty.
Pretty great, huh? This recipe is my specialty!
*munch* *munch*… <br> The seasoning is fantastic!
And the rice is steamed to perfection, too. <br> *munch* *munch*
*munch* *gulp* Phew… <br> Need to catch my breath… OK, onto the next one!
Which one should I grab first? Uh, I can’t decide…
What're ya doin’, Boss? Better get to eatin’ unless you want me to come out on top.
OK, I finished the first serving. What do you think, Kanna?
Hey, not bad. But you've still got some food left. Start shovelin' it in!
OK, onto meal two!
Bitter melon chanpuru…
Rice…
Tea…
Bitter melon chanpuru… It was good at first, but I'm starting to get tired of it.
*munch* *gulp* <br> OK! Managed to get it down!
The rice isn't as easy to wolf down as it was the first time, either…
*chomp* <br> Ugh… There, that should be all of it.
Phew… <br> I feel a little better after washing it down with some tea.
But I've still got food left to eat. Sigh… This is wearing me down.
Is it just me, or… I can't seem to move my chopsticks like before.
What's wrong, Boss? Ready to give up?
Man… I-I think two servings is my limit.
Hey, not bad! I didn't even think you'd eat this much!
Kanna… You're completely unruffled by this, huh?
Damn… I've come this far, I can't give up now!
B… Bitter…
Ri… ce…
Tea… Tea…
Urgh… C'mon, Ogami… Just a little more…
*munch*…
*munch*…
*chew*…
Th-There! I finished off all the chanpuru!
Just one more bite… Gotta eat all… the rice…
Hey, wait, you OK? You're lookin' a bit green around the gills!
Y-Yeah, just fine… Look, just one bite… left…
Phewww! That's the last of the rice eaten!
Ugh… My stomach's not doing too great right now…
…Hraaah! Time to drain this in one gulp!
Glub… Glub… Glub!
Haah! And that's all the tea!
Huff… Huff…
Hey, Boss, you OK!? You can stop any time, man.
Heheheh… I'm doing just fine… Just taking a quick break…
There! I ate absolutely everything! And… I was faster than you, Kanna!
Heheheh… But the victory still goes to me.
Huh? But wait, you're still eating, aren't you?
I'm eatin’ six servings, Boss.
Wh… What? Are you serious?!
…I admit defeat. There's no way in hell I can match up to you, Kanna.
There! Three servings, polished off!
Whaaa? You ate it all already?!
Heheh, eatin’ this amount was child's play.
You were so close, too… But you did great to scarf down as much as you did!
So you couldn't quite finish 3 servings… And here I thought you could go a little farther.
What the heck, Boss? You ate way less than I figured you could.
Kanna… Just how on earth can you eat this much food?!
Well… Good food is easy to eat. I guess that's my secret?
Gah… That's not a secret at all!
Hey Boss, your stomach doin' OK?
Yeah… I think I'll pull through.
In any case… You're something special all right, Kanna.
Speak for yourself! I bet if you pushed a little harder, you could eat even more!
But I guess the victory goes to me this time around!
I feel like my stomach's gotten a bit bigger after all that eating…
Well, I should get going… but my body feels… kinda heavy…
All the tableware from our eating contest earlier have been put neatly away.
Kanna is just incredible. She ate all that food and still managed to clean up afterwards.
We're between performances, so there aren't any patrons here.
None of the Flower Division members are here, either. I should head elsewhere.
If I recall, Maria is scheduled to return this month.
We haven't heard from her… But this is Maria we're talking about, so I'm sure she's fine.
We're not doing a performance this month, so there aren't any patrons around.
There's really no point in being here. I'll go somewhere else.
Everyone who saw King Lear looked pretty happy with it.
Turns out it wasn't a bad idea at all to make such a drastic change to the story.
Still, it was a zoo in here last month when it came time for the play.
I could barely keep up when it came to punching tickets. I'd better get some practice in…
King Lear was such a hit last summer, it was standing room only.
I hope our fall performance does just as well…
Looks like no one's here. Where did everyone go?
Nobody here… Looks like they're taking a day off from rehearsal.
Guess I should head to another room, anyway.
Come to think of it, Sakura's the one in charge of cleaning around here.
Every nook and cranny is cleaned to a shine. That's Sakura for you.
Organizing these outfits can't be easy. They have to be aired out on occasion to keep bugs at bay…
There really are a whole lot of costumes here, though… Just how many do we have?
No one's here. I guess this room doesn't see much use outside of performances.
Guess I should head to another room, anyway.
When Mr. Yoneda was still here, we had a lot of VIP patrons coming through.
Nobody's around. I'll go somewhere else.
It's empty. No one usually comes here during their free time.
Oh well. Guess I'll check someplace else.
There doesn't seem to be anyone on the terrace.
Maybe I’ll visit<br>
<sp>in the courtyard<br>now that the rain has<br>finally stopped.
I figured I'd check again, but there's still no one here…
Oh yeah, Kohran was asking for me, wasn't she? I'd best not be late.
…
(It looks like Orihime is back.)
(I wonder what she's always doing in the attic.)
Mamma…
Hm?
Mamma, it has been three months now since I came here to Japan.
At first, I thought that it would be a terrible place…
…because this is where HE was born, after all.
But I am starting to feel that, just maybe… it is not so bad after all.
My captain may be a busybody, but the theater is a fairly comfortable place to stay.
In the beginning, I wanted to run back home as soon as I could… but I have decided to stay a little longer.
I hope you are well, Mamma. I'm just fine, so you take care of yourself…
(Orihime…)
Say something.
…I should leave her be.
Orihime…
…!
M-Mr. Ensign! Just how long have you been there?!
S-Sorry… <br> I didn't mean to listen in.
You certainly do love to eavesdrop, don't you?! Just like usual!
Japanese men are all sneaky little cowards, after all!
I do not wish to see your face any longer! Now, get out of my way!
Wait, Orihime…
Well, eavesdropping isn't exactly commendable. Guess there's nothing else I can say.
(…I should leave her be. It wouldn't be right to bother her.)
(Still, I never expected to see this side of Orihime…)
Well now, I should be on my way.
(Oh, shoot! I gotta get out of here!)
Oh, Mr. Ensign. Whatever could you be doing here?
I-I could ask you the same thing.
Oh, me? I was just having a little chat.
Though, I am thinking you have no idea what I am talking about.
Now if you will pardon me. Please, enjoy yourself!
Orihime… So that's what you're always doing here.
Huh? I thought Orihime would be here, but…
Maybe I'll come back later…
There's no one in the attic. Not like anyone would come up here, though.
Oh well. I'll go try another room.
Oh, hey there, Iris.
Ah, Mon Frère!
What are you up to? Searching for a book?
Um… Auntie Kaede gave me a workbook, so I'm studying.
But the problems are all in Japanese, so I came to get a dictionary to look up the words I don't know.
Is that so? You're amazing, Iris.
Mon Frère… I get kind of… sleepy whenever I study.
Hahaha… Keep it up, Iris. Studying is important.
…Yeah. OK, I'm gonna keep studying for a little longer.
Iris is studying… Maybe I should drop in on her room to see how she's doing.
Nobody's here.
I'll try somewhere else. Maybe where everyone else seems to be going…
I wonder if Iris is in her room.
So Iris's nameplate is shaped like Jean-Paul…
I better check another room, I guess.
It's Ogami. <br> Are you there, Iris?
Yes… I am.
I'm studying right now. But it's so hard, it's making my head hurt…
Mind if I help you?
Really? You'd do that?
Sure. Though I don't know how much help I'll really be.
Then come on in! Yaaay, Mon Frère is gonna study with me!
Welcome to my room!
Thanks. By the way, what are you studying?
Today, I'm learning some new Japanese words.
Language studies, then? That does seem like it'd be a bit tough for you.
I'll be OK! I have you teaching me, after all!
Hahaha… I hope I live up to your expectations.
Let's get started, then.
Yeah!
Hmm…
Hey Mon Frère, what's a "three-legged race"?
How do two people equal three legs? Shouldn't they have four?
Well, you see…
Demonstrate with your legs.
Draw a picture.
Use an allegory.
Hmm, I think it may be easier to show you.
…Huh? Hey, whatcha doing?
Let's see, if I wrap this string around my right leg and your left leg…
There. If you combine both of our legs together like this, it makes a single leg.
Wooow, you're right! There's two of us, but we have three legs!
When people try to race this way, it's called a three-legged race.
We also use the term in Japanese to mean when two people cooperate towards a common goal.
Hmm… I'll draw you a picture.
OK, here we have two people.
Hey, Mon Frère… What is this?
Huh? It's supposed to be a person…
Kyahaha! It kinda looks like a monkey!
A monkey? But I tried so hard to draw this…
Ah, never mind. If you tie two of their legs together, it creates one leg.
Wow! So two monkeys' legs put together becomes one leg!
I get it! When two people work together, it's the same as a three-legged race!
W-Well, yes, but… Um, are you sure you understand it correctly?
Well now… Let's say you have an old man and woman.
There's a huge carrot growing in their field out back, but neither one of them can pull it out alone.
So if the two of them cooperate and give it a good, hard yank, they can harvest it together.
Oh, I see! So a three-legged race means that you should pick carrots with two people!
Umm, that's not quite what it means, but I guess that is the general idea…
Hmm, could a three-legged race be like when two people work together on something…?
Yes! That's exactly right, Iris! Nicely done.
Hee hee. I got it right! Hooray!
Hey Mon Frère, let's keep doing more!
All right then. On to the next problem!
Mon Frère… I can't keep going. I'm too sleepy…
Just one more, Iris. Come on, keep your head up!
Let's do it later, OK…?
Just push through it!
Guess we should stop.
Just push through it! One more problem. Come on, Iris!
…OK, OK. You're so strict, Mon Frère.
I guess we should stop, then. We'll finish the rest later.
Yaaay! <br> All done, all done!
You have to do it properly!
You didn't answer, so I decided I'm finished!
Good grief… I guess there's no point in pushing it, so we might as well leave off there.
Well, looks like you're done studying for today. Nice job, Iris.
Uh-huh! <br> Thanks, Mon Frère!
Leave the room.
Praise her.
Give her homework.
I'll head off, then. See you later.
Let's study again another time!
Phew… <br> I'm actually kind of tired.
I am doing this for Iris, though. I should keep checking in on her every now and then.
You worked really hard today, Iris. You did fantastic.
Really? Cause it was so much fun studying with you!
Let's study again another time!
Hahaha, I see. OK, I'll be off for now.
Phew… <br> I'm actually kind of tired.
I am doing this for Iris, though. I should keep checking in on her every now and then.
All right, here's your homework. Finish up to this page by next time.
Huh?! Mon Frère, you're awful!
It's important to do a little more each and every day. Understand?
Aaaall riiiight. <br> Aww, I hate this…
Phew… <br> I'm actually kind of tired.
I am doing this for Iris, though. I should keep checking in on her every now and then.
I'm… starting to feel sleepy again.
Well, I should be going. See you later, Iris.
OK… Goodnight.
Phew… <br> I'm actually kind of tired.
I am doing this for Iris, though. I should keep checking in on her every now and then.
I wonder if Iris is in her room.
So Iris's nameplate is shaped like Jean-Paul…
I better check another room, I guess.
Snoooore… Snooore…
Hahaha, I see she's taking a nap. All that studying earlier must've tired her out.
I wonder if Iris is in her room.
So Iris's nameplate is shaped like Jean-Paul…
I better check another room, I guess.
Snoooore… Snooore…
I wonder if Iris is in her room.
So Iris's nameplate is shaped like Jean-Paul…
I better check another room, I guess.
It doesn't seem like Iris is in there.
Why Ensign, is that you?
Hi there, Sumire. Having some tea?
Indeed. And the tea we have here is exceptional. Today I am drinking what's called Russian tea.
In order to make it, you must add a certain ingredient to black tea. Do you know what it is?
Sugar?
Salt?
Soy sauce?
Milk?
Jam?
Butter?
Um… Sugar?
I'm afraid not. Russian tea is made by adding jam to black tea.
I would hope you at least knew something this simple.
S-Sorry, I'll try to keep that in mind.
Salt, maybe?
For heaven's sake, would you at least try to answer seriously?
Russian tea is black tea flavored with jam.
I would hope you at least knew something this simple.
S-Sorry, I'll try to keep that in mind.
Could it be… soy sauce?
Oho ho ho! What a delightful joke that was, Ensign.
Russian tea is black tea flavored with jam.
At any rate, your sense of humor is impeccable as ever.
Y-You think so? Ha ha ha…
I know! It's milk, right?
Not quite! That would be a simple milk tea.
Russian tea is black tea flavored with jam.
Honestly, Ensign, milk? Are you taking this seriously or not?
S-Sorry.
I know! Jam, right?!
But of course you would know, Ensign.
When jam is added to black tea, we call it Russian tea.
I know! Butter, right?!
For heaven's sake, would you at least try to answer seriously?
Russian tea is black tea flavored with jam.
I would hope you at least knew something this simple.
S-Sorry, I'll try to keep that in mind.
Sorry, I don't know. Would you mind just telling me what it is?
Oh, very well, then. Perhaps it was too difficult a question to pose you out of nowhere.
Russian tea is a black tea flavored with jam.
I see now… I'll be sure to remember that.
In this day and age, it is a must for gentlemen to have some knowledge of tea as well.
Ensign, why not have a go at brewing some tea, yourself?
Wait, me?
Indeed. Now then, let us begin at once.
Oh boy, what have I gotten myself into now?
Now, Ensign. Here we have some hot water and some tea.
Please use them to brew a delicious cup of tea.
(Hot water and tea… What do I do first?)
Pour the tea.
Pour the water.
Pour the tea.
Pour the water.
For starters, you pour the tea into the cup.
…Ensign, you cannot make a truly wonderful cup of tea in this way.
First, you must allow the tea time to steep so that the leaves can unfurl.
Next, pour hot water into the cup to warm it up.
By doing so, you have brewed a delicious cup of tea.
I-I see… There's a lot to this.
First, you pour the hot water into the cup.
Splendid work!
You must pour hot water into the cup first in order to warm it up.
Then, after allowing ample time for the tea leaves to unfurl, you pour the tea…
This is the superior method to brew a delicious cup of tea.
I expected nothing less, Ensign. Thank you ever so for the delightful tea.
Hahaha… It was mostly luck.
I think I'll head out for now. Take it easy, Sumire.
Take care, Ensign.
You wait a little bit, then pour the tea.
Hmm… No, not quite.
You are correct in that you must give the tea leaves some time to unfurl before pouring…
But the superior method is to pour some water into the cup first to warm it up.
I-I see… There's a lot to this.
Hmm, I'm not sure. I'll just try pouring the water.
…Ensign, you cannot make a truly wonderful cup of tea in this way.
First, you must pour the water into the cup to warm it up.
Then after giving the tea leaves enough time to unfurl, you pour in the tea.
You were doing it in the correct order, but you took a little too long.
I-I see… There's a lot to this.
Hmm… So it's not enough just to pour it in…
Ensign, do allow me to instruct you on the proper method for brewing tea.
You must pour hot water into the cup first in order to warm it up.
After that, allow the leaves enough time to unfurl, and then pour in the tea.
I-I see… There's a lot to this.
Thank you, Sumire. That was quite educational.
These are naught but the fundamentals, Ensign.
How about this! From now on, I will give you personal lessons in proper tea etiquette each month.
Huh?! Sumire, you really don't need to!
There is no need to act humble, now. I will see you again for your next lesson in a month.
(Oh boy… I guess I'm stuck with this now.)
Ensign, please meet me here next month for another lesson.
Sure. Thanks, Sumire.
Well, looks like there's no one here but Sumire… I'd better go elsewhere.
This place is calming, indeed…
Having it remodeled to my specifications was truly a worthwhile endeavor.
Hahaha… Take it easy, Sumire.
No one here. I thought for sure Sumire would be here…
Maybe I'll try coming back a bit later.
This is Kaede's room.
I better check another room, I guess.
It's Ogami. <br> Are you there, Kaede?
Oh, Ogami? Just a moment.
Come on in.
Sorry to drop by unannounced.
I've never seen you wear that outfit before, but it really suits you.
Oh, thank you.
Haha. I never expected you to come out and say something so casual, Ogami.
…Oh, r-really?
Um… I thought, if you wanted, maybe we could chat for a bit…
That sounds perfect. I've been wanting to speak with you, as well.
Come on in, then. No need to be modest.
C-Certainly. Pardon me.
Wow… So this is your room, Kaede?
It's a little disorderly since I just got done working, so I apologize.
I'm sure it must have a completely different atmosphere from my sister's room, right?
Yes. Ayame's room had a very Japanese feel to it.
Hahaha, that sounds about right. She was always one to prefer a more Japanese style…
But as for myself, I like Western designs. Even though we're sisters, we were quite different.
By the way, what did you wish to discuss, Ogami?
Oh, um… Would it be all right if I asked you something?
What is it? I'll answer if I can.
Um, Kaede… Why did you join the Assault Troupe?
Haha, that's what you want to know?
Let me turn the question around. Why did you join the Imperial Assault Troupe, Ogami?
Ensure the capital's peace.
I was assigned to it.
Ensure the capital's peace.
I was assigned to it.
It's a living.
To ensure peace in the capital, of course.
Haha… A good answer befitting the Flower Division's captain.
It seems my sister was right when she told me just how devoted to your duty you are.
I was assigned here. I was given the order without much knowledge of what it was.
Goodness, it must have been quite the shock when you first arrived.
Still, I imagine you're glad you were assigned here in the end, am I right?
Yes.
Haha, good to hear.
It seems my sister was right when she told me what a serious-minded captain you are.
It's a living, you know? If you don't work, you don't eat, after all.
Ahaha… True enough. A job is a job.
It seems my sister was right when she told me just how unique you are.
Hmm… I guess you could say I just kinda ended up here.
Oh… So that's all?
You need to think things through more carefully. That carefree attitude isn't going to cut it.
It seems my sister was right when she told me you still have a few things to learn.
But she was also right about how unusually laid-back you can be.
So Ayame… said that much about me？
Yes. She spoke of the Assault Troupe often.
I suppose a large part of the reason I joined was due to her influence.
If you ever want to hear more about Ayame, come by again anytime.
All right. <br> Well, I should get going. <br> Please excuse me.
I'm glad I had a chance to speak with Kaede. Maybe I'll make an effort to drop by and see her sometimes.
This is Kaede's room.
I better check another room, I guess.
It's Ogami. <br> Are you there, Kaede?
Oh, Ogami.
I'm sorry, but I still have reports to write.
I see. Then I'll come by another time.
Sorry, Ogami. Let's sit down and chat some other time.
Now, what should I do…
Make a call.
Maybe next time.
OK, I'll make a call.
I'll call someone another time. Maybe I'll head somewhere else for now.
There's no one here… <br> Where did everyone go?
<sp>is pretty popular.<br>Maybe they’re all spending time with him. Hmm… I'll try somewhere else.
The sunlight here is so bright. It's nice and warm.
Well, I guess I'll keep going since there's nobody here.
The other day, Yuri told me that these VIP seats are 15 yen per ticket…
Still, the fact that these seats are always filled just shows how popular the Flower Division is.
No one's here. I'll try somewhere else.
Billiards and darts, huh? I seem to remember Kayama being pretty skilled at these.
Heh… This really takes me back to my days at the Naval Academy.
Come to think of it, I've never spent any time in here before.
I'd like to try playing billiards with someone.
If I recall, Maria is supposed to return this month.
Come back soon, Maria…
It's Maria's nameplate.
There's no reason to hang around since Maria's gone. I'll go somewhere else.
I wonder if Reni's here.
Nope, not here.
It's just a piece of paper from a notebook. I suppose that's fitting for someone like Reni.
OK, let's check another room.
I wonder if Sakura is in her room.
Too bad, she's not here.
It's just like Sakura to have a cute nameplate like this.
Let's go check another room.
I wonder if Kanna is in her room.
…She's not here.
A nametag hangs on the door, almost as if it's standing guard over Kanna's room in her absence.
OK, let's check another room.
I wonder if Sumire is in her room.
Nope, not here.
This is a pretty subtle design, considering it's Sumire.
Let's check another room.
I wonder if Orihime is in her room.
Seems she's not in.
The nameplate has a simple design, but it sure looks high class.
Let's go check another room.
I wonder just what Kohran wants to speak with me about.
We promised to meet at 4. It's a little early still.
A gear-shaped nameplate, huh? It's just Kohran's style.
Maybe I'll come back after I've wandered around a bit more.
Huh? Looks like someone's in the bathroom.
That looks like… the summer dress that Sakura was wearing…
Wh-Which means right now… Sakura’s in there.
I am drawn to the bath…
Go back outside.
O-Oh, no… <br> My body is moving towards the bathroom on its own…
Ahh, this feels great… So refreshing after getting soaked by the rain.
And I'm so happy Ogami said I looked good in that dress…
(Sakura…)
(C-Crap!)
…! <br> I-Is someone there?!
Make an excuse.
Run away.
Make an excuse.
S-Sakura… I can explain, really.
O-Ogami!!
Eeeeeek! <br> Get out of here!
Um, but I just-
I don't care, just get out! Now!
R-Right!
…
Sorry for just bumbling inside like that, Sakura…
I guess it's fine since you really didn't mean to…
…but please be more careful from now on.
Yeah… I really shouldn't have done that.
(I gotta get out of here before she sees me!)
Phew… <br> I think I got away before she realized I was there.
If I'd been just a moment slower, I might not have made it. That was too close.
Eeeek! O-Ogami?!
(Crap! No use in running now!)
Eeeeeek! <br> Get out of here!
Sorry! Leaving now!
…
Sorry for just bumbling inside like that, Sakura…
I guess it's fine since you really didn't mean to…
…but please be more careful from now on.
Now if you'll excuse me, I need to do my sword training.
Yeah… I really shouldn't have done that.
(I've gotta get out of here before Sakura finds me.)
Phew… <br> Looks like she didn't see me.
I can't be peeping in the baths like this. I'd better stop here.
Ahh, I feel brand-new… I guess I'd better get out.
(Oh, crap!! It looks like she's getting out of the water!)
(I gotta get out of here before she sees me!)
Phew… <br> I think I got away before she realized I was there.
If I'd been just a moment slower, I might not have made it. That was too close.
Oh, Ogami. Are you here to bathe?
N-No… That's not it.
You know, you did get pretty wet in the rain earlier.
Why not take a bath to warm up so you don't catch a cold?
G-Good idea. <br> Thanks, Sakura.
I'd better be going. <br> See you later.
Yeah… A bath doesn't sound too bad.
Get in the bath.
Go somewhere else.
OK, I think I will take a bath.
I don't have time to lounge in here all day… But a short, relaxing bath would be nice.
Phew… <br> Ohh, this feels great.
<sp>was almost hit by<br>a car and I got hurt saving him. But now even my injured leg feels healed.
Soaking in this huge bath all by myself is seriously heaven on earth…
Now that I'm nice and warmed up, I guess it's time to get out.
Ahh… That was a nice bath.
15 minutes went by before I even realized.
I might've lazed around for just a bit too long, though. OK, time to go.
I don't really have time to keep relaxing. I should head somewhere else.
A bath, huh? I guess I did get caught in a downpour on the way to the hospital.
Wouldn't hurt to warm myself up a little.
Get in the bath.
Go somewhere else.
All right, I'll hop in the bath.
I don't have time to lounge in here all day… But a short, relaxing bath would be nice.
Phew… <br> Ohh, this feels great.

I don't really have time to keep relaxing. I should head somewhere else.
Looks like there's no one here.
I took a bath already, so there's no need for me to be here.
Heya, Chief. What're you up to way over here?
I could ask you the same thing.
Who, me? Just running an analysis on some materials for my next big invention.
Just as I'd expect.
What kind of invention?
Just as I'd expect.
What's your secret project?
Just as I'd expect.
What kind of invention?
Just as I'd expect. You barely made it through the front door before starting on your next invention.
Ahh Chief, you can't just whisper sweet nothings at me like that!
The truth is, you're the only one around here who can even make use of this processor, Kohran.
Whatever invention you're cooking up, I can't wait to see what it'll be.
Thanks for that, Chief. Hearing you say that gives me the push I need to keep plugging away at it.
So, what kind of invention is it?
Heheheh… Sorry, but that's my little secret.
You'll get to see it soon enough, so keep your eyes peeled!
Oh right, I just remembered! What exactly was that secret project you were working on?
Oops… W-Well, uh… Dang it, your memory's too good, Chief.
With how mysterious you're being, it was pretty hard to forget.
…Well, I can't tell you every little thing about it just yet, but…
The design phase of this project, which we were in charge of, is already wrapped up.
Now, we're sending it over to the troupe's Hokkaido Branch to bring us into the project's home stretch.
All right, but you never gave me an answer. What in the world are you working on?
…Sorry Chief, but just this once I'm gonna have to ask you to be patient.
It won't be long before I'm able to tell you everything you wanted to know and more. So hang in there!
Hrm… Hearing that wishy-washy answer is just making me even more concerned.
…
…? <br> Got some deep thoughts rattling around in there, Chief?
No… I just feel bad for coming here and disturbing your work.
No need to tiptoe around me, you know. It's nothing world-shattering, after all.
OK, analysis complete! I'd better make like a tree and leave.
Sure. Best of luck with your invention.
Thank you kindly. I'll see you in my room at 4, and don't be late!
A new invention, huh? What in the world could it be?
Well, I'm sure she'll show it to me sooner or later. I ought to get going, too.
The heat from the steam processor makes this room hotter than the others.
Crap, I'm sweating. What am I doing here when it's this hot out, anyway?
Whoa! R-Reni! Why are you naked?!
I'm swimming.
Reni…
Sorry, I'm leaving!
Put on a swimsuit!
Sorry, I'm leaving!
Put on a swimsuit!
Sorry, I'm leaving!
Put on a swimsuit!
…Maybe I'll swim, too.
S-Sorry! I'm leaving right now!
…
Please excuse me!
Huff… Huff… <br> I thought my heart was gonna pop out of my chest.
Still though… Somehow, it doesn't surprise me all that much to see Reni swimming without a suit.
R-Reni, put on a swimsuit!
…A swimsuit?
Swimming without clothing is more efficient, as it reduces the drag from the water.
That may be, but swimming naked while other people are around is asking for trouble!
So unless you wanna cause a scene, you need to wear a swimsuit!
…Understood. I will do so from now on.
Y-You get it, right? Then I'm leaving now!
Huff… Huff… <br> I thought my heart was gonna pop out of my chest.
Still though… Somehow, it doesn't surprise me all that much to see Reni swimming without a suit.
…Maybe I'll take a dip, too. Wanna swim together, Reni?
…I'm done swimming, now.
I-I see… Oh well.
I guess I'll be going, then. See you, Reni.
Oh man. I wish I hadn't put my foot in my mouth.
Still though… Somehow, it doesn't surprise me all that much to see Reni swimming without a suit.
…Did you need something?
N-No, I… was just taken aback…
Listen Reni, you really ought to wear something when you go swimming.
Swimming without clothing is more efficient, as it reduces the drag from the water.
That may be, but swimming naked while other people are around is asking for trouble!
So unless you wanna cause a scene, you need to wear a swimsuit!
…Understood. I will do so from now on.

Huff… Huff… <br> I thought my heart was gonna pop out of my chest.
Still though… Somehow, it doesn't surprise me all that much to see Reni swimming without a suit.
Hey, Reni. Getting some swim practice in?
…
Wait… Are you naked?
I know it feels nice to swim naked, but you ought to at least wear some swim shorts.
Swimming without clothing is more efficient, as it reduces the drag from the water.
Maybe so, but it could cause trouble if one of the female troupe members saw you this way.
…
Come to think of it… I've always thought your body seemed pretty feminine, Reni.
Looking at your chest now, it seems rounded enough that you might have b…
…B-B-Breasts?!
R-Reni… are you… a g-girl?
…Yes.
Wh-Whaaaaaaaatttt!?
Leave immediately.
Shut your eyes.
I-I'm sorry! I just barged in here without knowing that you were a girl…
It's fine. No need to apologize.
There are only a few functional differences between male and females.
A-Anyway, I'm leaving right now. Sorry for barging in!!
Huff… Huff… <br> I thought my heart was gonna pop out of my chest.
Even so… To think that Reni is a girl… Hmm…
I suppose she never did specifically say that she was a boy…
But still, how did a girl like her learn so much about combat and warfare?
R-Reni! I closed my eyes, so I didn't see anything!
OK… I'm leaving right away.
Yeeeowch! <br> Damn, who put a wall here?
The door is a bit more to your right.
Th-Thanks. <br> And, erm… Sorry, Reni.
Huff… Huff… <br> I thought my heart was gonna pop out of my chest.
Even so… To think that Reni is a girl… Hmm…
I suppose she never did specifically say that she was a boy…
But still, how did a girl like her learn so much about combat and warfare?
I'm done swimming… The pool is all yours.
O-Oh no, I wasn't…
A-Anyway, I'm leaving right now. Sorry for barging in!!
Huff… Huff… <br> I thought my heart was gonna pop out of my chest.
Even so… To think that Reni is a girl… Hmm…
How did a girl like her learn so much about combat and warfare?
I don't think she would tell me, even if I asked her… Just one mystery after another with her.
Reni…
I'm done changing. I'll be on my way.
I've done this not just once, but twice now… I'm sorry, Reni.
…It's fine.
I will be sure to wear a swimsuit from now on.
I wouldn't wish to cause a scene.
I-I think that's for the best, yeah.
I'll be on my way.
Sigh… Same as ever, I see.
Why am I just standing around here, anyway? I'd better get going, too.
…
Reni…
Sorry about earlier.
So you're a girl.
Sorry about earlier.
You’re kind of cute…
I'm sorry about earlier. I didn't realize that you were… a girl.
…It's fine.
Um… I suppose you'd prefer I kept this a secret from the others?
I don't mind if you tell them. It's all the same to me.
One's biological sex makes no difference in battle.
Reni…
Well, I was just… surprised to learn that you're a girl.
No one ever asked, so I never mentioned it.
One's biological sex makes no difference in battle.
Reni…
When you put it that way… You’re kind of cute.
Cute?
Is that… a desirable quality?
Y-Yeah… I’m trying to give you a compliment.
All right. <br> I will accept it.
So Reni’s a girl, huh…
I don't know how I should put this, but… that makes me kind of happy.
If you have nothing to say, I'm leaving.
Ah, R-Reni!
I should've just come out and apologized to her.
No one's here. I wouldn't mind a dip in the pool myself, since summertime is here.
I don't have my swimsuit on me, so maybe next time.
Oh, Chief.
Hey Kohran. Come to check on the Koubu?
You betcha!
Since I just got back, I figured the first order of business oughta be to greet these guys.
I'm back, my little Koubu. Let's keep working our hardest, you and me.
Good to meet you, Eisenkleids. I'm Kohran Li.
I've heard an awful lot about you. Here's to a long, fruitful relationship.
These guys seem to be doing just fine, too. That's a relief.
You sure do love machines.
Can you talk to them?
Kohran… You sure do love machines.
I dunno if I'd say that… It's almost closer to affection, I guess.
Yeah, that's it. These guys are like kids to me.
A bunch of really great kids who're always giving it their best for us.
They even kick up a fuss when they're not given the proper attention just like kids do, hahaha.
That's why we gotta keep our chins up, so these guys can stay in top form.
Kohran…
Kohran… Can you talk to the Koubu?
Wh-What? No way! Even I can’t talk to machines.
But, man… How great would it be if I really could hold a conversation with them?
They could tell me right away if they were hungry, or if they hurt somewhere…
And it'd be so awesome to hear them shout "Let's go!" or give a battle cry.
Hahaha, I see.
…Hey, quit gawping at me.
Is it really that weird, having a conversation with a machine?
No, that's not what I meant. It just seems very much like something you'd do.
Is that right? Well, if you say so…
Hey Chief, I oughta get moving, here.
Make sure you show up at my room at 4 o'clock sharp, and don't be late! See ya!
Greeting the Koubu, huh? That's just like Kohran.
Well… I ought to get going, myself.
It's so quiet right now… Almost as if the commotion of our recent mission never happened.
I've got some free time right now, but there's no reason for me to be here. I should be going.
Why, Ogami, how unusual to see you here.
Goodness, what happened to your ankle? You're limping a little.
Yeah, I twisted it while saving that little dog.
How awful. Let me apply a cold compress to it.
Here, let me see your ankle… That should do it.
Ahh… The cold feels nice.
Thank you, Saki. That helps a lot.
Of course. It's the least I could do. I'll see you later, then.
I think that ought to help my sprained ankle for the time being.
OK, time to go somewhere else.
If you'd like… You and I could do something nice together.
Wh-What? Saki, you're still trying to…
Eep! S-Something nice?!
Hm hm hm. Only joking.
I'll be on my way, then. Bye-bye, Ogami.
Hrm… I'm not sure whether to be relieved, or disappointed…
I'd better leave and go elsewhere before I put my foot in my mouth.
Looks like Saki isn't here anymore.
Guess I'd better go somewhere else.
The very heart of the Imperial Assault Troupe, defenders of peace in the capital…
This place really is best suited for Mr. Yoneda. I'm not quite there yet.
Even with the facilities we have here, keeping the capital safe is no easy task.
When it comes down to it, the bonds with your comrades are worth more in battle than combat ability.
I thought Kanna or someone would be here, working up a sweat… That's disappointing.
Oh well, I'll check another room.
Yeah, no one here. I'll go somewhere else.
This room is just as untidy as ever.
There's no reason for me to be here, so I should head somewhere else.
*cough* <br> I'm getting covered in dust just standing here.
I'd better get out of here and go someplace else.
One bath was enough. Time to go somewhere else.
That soap smells really nice. It must be from Sakura's bath a little while ago.
There's no point in standing around in here. Let's move to another room.
No one here. I'll go somewhere else.
No one here. I'll go somewhere else.
Hey… Mon… Frère!
Hey, Iris, what's up?
You know, on July 5th… <br> It's gonna be my birthday!
Is that right? <br> Happy birthday, Iris.
Hee hee, thank youuu!
Do you know how old I'm gonna be?
11 years old.
12 years old.
13 years old.
You'll be 11 years old, right?
No, you're wrong! <br> I'm gonna be 12!
Oh, th-that's right… <br> Sorry, it slipped my mind.
Jeez! <br> Remember it next time!
You'll be 12. <br> I remember that much.
Thank you, Mon Frère! <br> I knew you'd remember!
Hahaha, of course I did.
I think… you'll be 13?
No… <br> I'm turning 12 years old.
O-Oh… Is that so…
But does that mean… <br> I'm starting to look more grown-up?
Hee hee, I'm so happy. Thanks, Mon Frère.
…How old did you say you were going to be?
Huh? <br> Did you forget already?
I'm about to turn 12 years old. You'd better remember!
S-Sorry.
Hey, hey, Mon Frère. <br> Umm… Well…
Hm? What's up, Iris?
I was hoping… you would give me a present.
Whatever you give me, I promise I'll treasure it always…
(A present, huh? What would make a good gift?)
What would you like?
I'll bake a cake.
Let's go on a date.
What would you like, Iris? I'll buy you anything you want.
You will? Oh, thank you!
Just, maybe nothing TOO expensive, OK? Hahaha.
Oh, that's all right! <br> I want a book.
It's called "The Blue Bird." I'm gonna be in the fall play we're doing based on that book, so…
Is that so? <br> You're amazing, Iris.
Then let's go buy it together on your birthday.
OK! Oooh, why can't it be 5 days from now already?!
All right, how about I bake you a cake?
Wait, really? You'll really bake me one?! Oh my gosh!
It's for your birthday, so I'll give it my all.
Then, can you add lots and lots of strawberries to it?
A strawberry cake, is it? Sure, I can do that.
OK! Oooh, why can't it be 5 days from now already?!
Let's see… <br> Why don’t we take ourselves out on a date?
Really? <br> Mon Frère, do you mean it?!
Yeah, of course.
I'll take you anywhere you like. Ginza, Asakusa, Ueno, just name it.
Yay, yay, yaaay! <br> Ooh, where should we go? What should I wear?
I don't think I can wait 5 more days!!
Hmmm… What should I do?
…Hey Mon Frère, could I ask you for something?
Sure, what is it?
Um… For my birthday, do you think you could spend aaaall day with me?
Iris…
Could you, please?
…Yeah, OK. Let's spend the whole day together.
Hee hee! I hope the next 5 days pass quickly!
Hahaha, it'll be here before you know it.
Yeah!
I'm gonna go back to my room now. Bye-bye, Mon Frère!
Hahaha… <br> Guess I'm wrapped around her little finger now.
Well, I should be on my way, too.
…Ack! Oh shoot, when did it get past 4 o’clock?!
Kohran must have been waiting in her room! <br> I gotta hurry!
Yeah? Who's there?
It's Ogami…
…Seems a little past 4, don't you think?
I-I know, sorry. <br> I ran late…
…I guess it's fine. <br> Come on in.
S-Sure, thanks.
Chief, that you? Come on in, door's unlocked.
Sure, thanks.
Just plant your buns right there, I'm nearly done.
Working on something else, I see?
Well, it's the one thing I'm good at. Since I was a kid, I've done nothing but tinker with machines.
That long, huh? So, what kind of machines have you messed with?
I started out by fiddling around with my father's pocket watch…
But that watch ended up becoming the only memento I had of him…
A memento…?
…See, I lost both my folks when I was young.
I was just a little kid when it all happened. It was in 1911… A revolution broke out in China.
In 1911… That was the year of the Xinhai Revolution.
Yeah… My mother and father both got caught up in the fighting…
In the end, I lost my home, my parents, my sisters… Everything.
After that, Ayame invited me over here to Japan, and I joined the Assault Troupe…
At first… I had a lot of trouble adjusting to being in the troupe.
But then, Yoneda asked me to put my skills at tinkering with machines to work.
That's when I finally started to feel like I'd found a place I belonged.
Though, I've never had anyone to talk shop with before…
The way I see it, Chief… <br> I have three dads.
My real father, back in China… My dad back in Kobe, who took me in when I came to Japan…
And here at the theater, it's Yoneda.
Mr. Yoneda?
How dare those bastards shoot him…!
I don't know who the hell these guys are, but I swear I'll make them pay!
The second we find them, I'll bash their worthless heads in!
K-Kohran…
Uh… S-Sorry about that, Chief. Guess I went and got a bit too fired up.
It's OK. By the way, wasn't there something you wanted to speak to me about?
Oh yeah, glad you asked! I just finished work on a brand new creation.
This black ball? <br> What is it?
Heh-heh… <br> It's my newest invention. Feast your peepers on this!
The well-prepared have nothing to fear! That’s the guiding principle of invention.
Anyways, here. Try hurling it to the floor, as hard as you can.
Throw it to the floor.
As hard as I can, huh? <br> Here goes!
…Hang on, is this thing smoking?!
Oh, shoot…
Th-This is…
Wait a tic, that's strange. How come it exploded before you even threw it?
The explosive force is really missing something. Hm, maybe I'll try doubling the amount of gunpowder.
K-Kohran…
Let's not do this, Kohran. I've got a seriously bad feeling about this…
…Yikes! There's smoke coming out of this thing!
Aww, but I can't run the experiment unless you throw it first…
Heheheh, the explosion would've been even bigger if you'd thrown it.
K-Kohran…
Sorry I drag you over here for this every time, Chief…
But you're really the only one I can ask to help me with this.
I think it's finally hitting me that I'm back at the theater.
Well, I'll be happy to help in the future too, Kohran.
And I'm glad to hear it! I'll be looking forward to your assistance next time I make something new!
Eeep?!
Oh man… <br> Looks like I'm picking up a side job as a human guinea pig…
Listen to some gossip.
I'll come back later.
Seems like you’ve started keeping a dog in the courtyard, Ogami.
That’s right. Sorry I made the decision without consulting you two first.
Oh, it's no problem!<br>The dog's name is<br>
, isn't it?
You got that information pretty quick. Just like always, Yuri.
Heheh. Actually, Kohran just dropped by to tell us the news. She was really excited to talk about it.
I see, glad to hear it.<br>I hope that you two<br>will play with<sp>
<br>every now and then.
Has Mr. Yoneda been doing OK?
Yeah, we just visited him in the hospital and he was as lively as ever.
He's not allowed to drink there, so it’s a good opportunity for his body to recover a bit.
Well, this is the manager we're talking about. He's probably been sneaking some alcohol on the sly.
I heard from Kanna recently that some food in the kitchen's gone missing.
Huh?! D-Don't tell me there are rats?
I don't think so. The food disappears along with the packaging.
Perhaps, unbeknownst to us, there is a person secretly living in the theater…
…Just kidding. Did I make your heart skip a beat?
Ogami, have you ever been to Café Paulista?
Um, Cafe… what now? <br> No, I haven't.
It’s a place that serves delicious coffee and donuts.
The cafe is wonderful, but all of the customers seem to be a bunch of writer types.
Whenever I go, I always end up having some kind of high-minded conversation… It gets tiring sometimes.
By the way, I've heard that there are quite a few female bus conductors these days!
Women that work alongside men are pretty cool, don't you think?
I kind of admire them.
Ah, now that I think about it, Ogami, you’re a man working among mostly women, aren’t you?  
By the way, Maria is scheduled to return from America soon.
Huh, is that so? It will be a huge relief to have her back.
You look happy to hear that, Ogami. Were you lonely without Maria?
I-It's not like that. I’m just happy to have another member return to the Flower Division.
It’s hard keeping an eye on everyone all by myself.
I see. I’m sure it must be difficult to keep the team together on your own.
That reminds me. People have apparently seen a mysterious figure in the theater holding a guitar.
Sometimes, they even hear the sounds of a guitar playing alongside someone singing.
From what I understand, they don’t appear to be from the theater's orchestra.
If I ever find out who it is, you’ll be the first to know.
O-OK… Thanks.
Speaking of which, summer break is coming up next month.
I'm thinking of buying the latest swimsuit and going to the beach! How about we go together, Kasumi?
Um… I think I'll pass… <br> By the way, do you have any plans for summer break, Ogami?
Hmm… In this line of work, we don’t really get days off. Who knows if we’ll get a vacation this summer…
Sorry, Ogami, but I'm all out of gossip for now.
I'll have some more interesting tidbits to share another time, so look forward to it!
Oh… Ogami, I see you bought Maria's bromide.
I thought I should at least get her bromide since she’s off in America right now.
Would you like me to give you her call number, Ogami?
…Really?
She actually gave me her number in case of emergencies.   
You can talk to her if you dial "13900."
13900, OK. Thanks, Yuri!
I'll come back another time. Good luck with your work.
OK. <br> Thanks for coming, Ogami.
Let us know if you hear any juicy stories!
Sorry Ogami, but customers are only allowed to purchase one of each bromide.
I see. That's too bad.
So sorry, Mr. Ogami, but customers are only allowed to purchase one of each bromide.
Oh, really? That's too bad.

Ayame and I almost never lived in the same household, even though we were sisters.
Eh…?
It's not so unusual, given our lineage. We have less a family tree and more a family wisteria.
Yet, I still knew that she was the type of person that would sacrifice her own well-being for others…
Carrying everyone's burdens by herself…
That's why, when I received the news that she had passed away, I made up my mind.
I want to carry on her will. I want to protect the capital, just like she did.
And for my own sake, too.
…I suppose that's all I have to say.
You know, Ogami, I came here to work of my own volition.
To protect the peace of this city, and to cherish our audience's smiles.
I'm sure you feel the same, Ogami.
Yes, of course.
So let's both do our best.
For my sister… <br> For everyone…
Yes, ma'am!
Well, today I will tell you about the Anti-Kouma Corps.
The Anti-Kouma Corps was the Army's predecessor to the Imperial Assault Troupe.
Ikki Yoneda, Kazuma Shinguji, Shinnosuke Yamazaki, and… Ayame Fujieda.
A special unit, comprising only those four, formed to defend the capital from evil.
Seven years ago… A Kouma appeared in Nihonbashi.
Even though it was just a single Kouma, the military and police were powerless against it.
However, the Anti-Kouma Corps managed to seal the Kouma away, albeit at great cost.
That incident made the government painfully aware of the need to defend against such evil.
As a result, the Imperial Assault Troupe as you know it was born.
The troupe is the fruit of the Anti-Kouma Corps' will.
And, of the four members, only General Yoneda is still alive today.
For the sake of those four, who protected the people from evil… We have to keep fighting.
…
Now then, today I'll tell you about Ayame's travels.
In order to recruit members for the Flower Division, Ayame traveled around the world.
She searched for suitable Flower Division candidates, girls with powerful spiritual abilities.
She sent me letters from various countries. America, France, China…
Whenever she did, I must be honest, I envied her.
I see, so she did all that…
Those same candidates make up the Flower Division we have now.
And you know what, Ogami? Recently, I've been thinking…
The people Ayame chose truly were the best people for the job. That includes you.
Kaede…
Ayame entrusted the Flower Division to me, so I'll continue to give it my all.
Don't give up. Even in the hardest of times, remember to never give up, Ogami.
Yes, ma'am! <br> I will do all I can to meet your expectations!
Now then, today I'll tell you about Ayame and Major Yamazaki.
Both Ayame and Major Yamazaki were members of the troupe's predecessor, the Anti-Kouma Corps.
Major Yamazaki was a brilliant scientist who created the foundational designs for Spirit Armor…
And they say he had a stronger sense of justice than most.
Anyone could see that Ayame and Major Yamazaki were deeply in love with each other…
But their relationship crumbled when the Kouma War started.
What could have possibly caused that?
Now, this is pure conjecture…
But it seems that during their battles, Major Yamazaki became obsessed with certain questions.
“What are these demons?" "Why do they exist?"
And "how are they so powerful?"
General Yoneda noticed that Major Yamazaki had changed, and he warned him many times.
But, in the end, no one could change his mind.
Not even Ayame…
When the Kouma War ended seven years ago, Major Yamazaki went missing.
And then in our recent battles, he appeared again as Aoi Satan.
Justice by power… <br> Rule through evil…
Perhaps that was his conclusion…
Back when he appeared in front of the theater six months ago…
I wonder what Aoi Satan… No, what Major Yamazaki was trying to tell us…
