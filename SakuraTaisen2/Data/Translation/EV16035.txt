Say, Ensign! Do we need to change our strategy?
Oh, Orihime…
Let's go with the Fire strategy!
Let's go with the Mountain strategy!
Let's stick with our current strategy.
OK, let's go with the Fire strategy!
All right! Let's sweep each and every enemy aside in one blow!
OK, let's go with the Mountain strategy!
Understood! Now is the time to hold steady!
No, let's stick with our current strategy.
If you say so! Roger that!
…No. I think we should keep going with our current formation.
O-Oh, really now? Very well, then!
