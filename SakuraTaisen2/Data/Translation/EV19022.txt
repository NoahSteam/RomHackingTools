Sections 1 through 3 of the Mikasa's engines have been destroyed!
There are still four sections left unscathed!
The ship's operating at 60% capacity! Our current rate of ascension is still tenable!
Can you hear me, Ogami? <br> We can't risk any more damage. We're counting on you!
Understood, Kaede, ma'am.
