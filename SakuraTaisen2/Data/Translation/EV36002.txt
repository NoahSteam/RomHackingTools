Heh… Heheheh… <br> You didn't think this battle was over, did you?
I still have… an ace up my sleeve.
What?! <br> Is that bomb still active?!
Hehhheheheh! <br> Time to incinerate the trash, once and for all!
…Ah! Ogami, look!
Wait, isn't that… <br> There's still one left?!
Now, come! Light up the troupe and burn them to a crisp!
I don't think so!!
Wh-What are you doing?! <br> S-Stay back! <br> Get away from me!!

Mr. Ensign…
It seems I was… mistaken this whole time.
Friends, teamwork… <br> I thought all of that was nonsense.
But now… I feel like I understand it a little…
Everyone… <br> And you, Mr. Ensign… <br> Thank you.
Orihime!
Oh my, aren't we sweet all of a sudden?
It seems the Flower Division has finally come together as one.
…Orihime. Let's both do our best from here on out.
OK, Mr. Ensign. <br> You can count on me.
But you'll have to take responsibility for changing my heart so quickly!
Responsibility… <br> Responsibility for what?
Heeheehee! <br> …OK, everyone, it’s time to do our usual thing!
All right! <br> Take it away, Orihime!
OK, here we go! <br> Ready, and…
Victory pose, yeah!!
