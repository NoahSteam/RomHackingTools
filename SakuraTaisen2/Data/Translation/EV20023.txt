Fourth wave of Kouma, incoming!
I-I can't believe this…
We can't return fire with the deck's cannons anymore!
A-All cannons, open fire!
We're at our limit! <br> We can't hold them off anymore!
EEEEEEEEK!!
The Mikasa has surpassed critical levels of damage!
Everyone, hold your positions! We have to believe in Ogami!
Roger!
Just a little more, Ogami! You can do this!
Y-Yes, ma'am!
