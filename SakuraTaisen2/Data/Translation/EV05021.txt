Looks like you've managed to catch the enemy off guard, for the time being.
But the reinforcements you've lured here are only about 300 meters away.
If they manage to regroup, we'll have totally lost the advantage…
We'll need to confuse the enemy and prevent them from joining up.
If they're coming by sea, then we need to take out their beachhead.
If they're coming from the mountains, you might be able to find a way to block off that narrow path.
There's not much time. Good luck, Ogami.
