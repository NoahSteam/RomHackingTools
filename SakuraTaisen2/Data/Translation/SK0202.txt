A new member... I can't wait for her to come. 
Looking forward to it, Iris? 
Yep! I'm always happy to make new friends! 
Hey, Mon Frère, what do you think the new girl will be like? 
I hope she's a nice person. 
I hope she's strong. 
I hope she's cute. 
Well, I hope she's a nice person. 
Yeah! I hope we can become good friends. 
Don't worry, I'm sure you'll get along well with her. 
She was assigned to the Flower Division to protect the capital. I'm sure she'll be strong. 
Yeah! You're right. 
OK, I'm gonna work extra hard to keep up with the new girl! 
I hope the new girl is cute. 
Mon Frère! Don't you cheat on me! 
I-Iris! You're starting to sound just like Sakura now! 
I'm your girlfriend, of course I would! 
I don't know what she'll be like... 
But I hope we can share all kinds of happy moments together, as fellow members of the Flower Division. 
Yeah! Mon Frère, you're so cool! 
It's time to get back and continue preparing for the party. 
OK. I hope the new girl gets here soon! 
The new girl isn't here yet. 
It's not even noon yet. Come on, let's go back inside. 
OK. 
No one's really around when the Flower Division's not putting on a play. 
Well, next month is the summer show. It'll be full of people again when it starts. 
This place seems so lonely with no one around. 
Hey, Mon Frère, let's go somewhere else! 
Right, let's go. 
Hi there, Ogami! Would you like to buy something? 
Welcome, Ogami! Oh, is that Iris with you? 
Yep, I'm preparing a welcome party with Mon Frère! 
Oh, that's right, I heard from Yuri that there's a new member joining the team. 
Good luck with your preparations, you two! 
Yeah. I'll do my best! 
Oh, Iris, let me tell you something. 
The first photo Ogami bought when he came back to the theater was yours. 
What? Mon Frère, is that true? 
Oh, yes. That's right. 
Thank you, Mon Frère. I'm... I'm so happy! 
If there was a photo of you, Mon Frère, I'd definitely buy one. 
Hmmm. I don't think my photos would sell very well. 
That's not true. I'm sure that everyone in the Flower Division would buy one, at least. 
That's right! I'd use my pocket money to buy a whooole bunch of them! 
Hahaha, thank you, Iris. 
By the way, Ogami. What can I do for you? 
Buy a photo 
Talk to Tsubaki 
Leave 
Could I buy a photo? 
Sorry, Ogami. I can only sell one photo to a customer per month. 
Please understand, we need to keep some for the other patrons. 
You'd like to buy a photo? Thank you very much! 
That's a photo of Sakura. 
Let's see... Sakura's photo, right? 
That'll be 50 sen. Thank you very much! 
That's a photo of Sumire. 
Let's see... Sumire's photo, right? 
That'll be 50 sen. Thank you very much! 
That's a photo of Maria. 
Let's see... Maria's photo, right? 
That'll be 50 sen. Thank you very much! 
That's a photo of Kanna. 
Let's see... Kanna's photo, right? 
That'll be 50 sen. Thank you very much! 
That's a photo of Iris. 
Mon Frère, are you going to buy my photo? 
All right, I'll take one of Iris. 
Really? Yay! Yay! 
It's a cute photo. I'll treasure it. 
Thank you, Mon Frère. 
I wish they had your photo, so I could buy it, too... 
Hmm, a photo of me? I don't think they'd sell very well. 
That's not true. I'm sure that everyone in the Flower Division would buy one, at least. 
That's right! I'd use my pocket money to buy a whooole bunch of them! 
Thank you, Iris. 
OK, Tsubaki, here's the money for the photo. It's 50 sen, right? 
Yes! Thank you as always! 
That's a photo of Kohran. 
Let's see... Kohran's photo, right? 
That'll be 50 sen. Thank you very much! 
That's a photo of Orihime. 
Orihime's photo is finally available for purchase! Don't miss your chance to buy it! 
Let's see... Orihime's photo, right? 
That'll be 50 sen. Thank you very much! 
Oh, so you're not going to buy any? 
Oh right, Tsubaki. We're having a welcome party for the new member backstage at 12 o'clock. 
You should definitely come, too! 
OK, got it! 12 o'clock backstage, right? 
The gift shop closes at noon for lunch, so I'll definitely be there. 
Things always get busy for me when we get new members. 
I have to make new pamphlets and photos to sell. 
I see. A new photo, huh...? 
I'm sure they'll be ready by next month, so please look forward to them. 
I wonder what time the new member will arrive? 
Well, I should get going. Keep up the good work. 
Thank you, come again! Good luck with preparing for the welcoming party! 
Thank you! Good luck with preparing for the welcoming party! 
Oh right, Tsubaki. We're having a welcome party for the new member backstage at 12 o'clock. 
You should definitely come, too! 
OK, got it! 12 o'clock backstage, right? 
The gift shop closes at noon for lunch, so I'll definitely be there. 
Mon Frère, are you hungry? 
We'll have lots of food at the welcome party, so you'll have to wait. 
Hahaha, right. 
OK, let's get going. We're still getting things ready. 
No one's here. Let's go somewhere else. 
Who was that person just a second ago? 
Ugh, Mon Frère! You always get so lovestruck when you see a pretty woman. 
I-I wouldn't call it "lovestruck" or anything... 
But if she's a guest, I can't be rude to her, right? 
That's true, but... 
... 
Mon Frère, do you like older women? 
I prefer older women. 
I prefer younger women. 
I prefer older women. 
I prefer younger women. 
I don't care about age. 
It'd be nice to be spoiled by an older woman. 
I knew it. So you like them older, don't you, Mon Frère? 
No, no, Iris. I didn't mean anything by it. 
Just you wait. In another ten years, I'll be a grown woman, too! 
So don't cheat on me, Mon Frère! 
Hahaha, OK, I got it, Iris. 
I think I like younger girls better. 
Really!? Yayyy! 
I love you, too, Mon Frère! 
I don't care how old they are. 
That's right. As long as there's love, any difference in age doesn't matter, right? 
Yeah, you're right. Where did you learn to say that? 
Heheh, that's a secret. 
... 
...What's wrong? Did I say something weird? 
It's nothing. I was just thinking about something. 
Thank goodness. I was worried about you. 
Come on, Mon Frère. Let's find the plates and get backstage. 
...Yeah. Plates, plates, plates... 
... 
OK, Iris, there we go. 
Yay! Let's go back to the room, Mon Frère! 
Yes, let's do that. We just take these back, and we're all set. 
Don't take any, Mon Frère! 
There's going to be a lot of food at the welcome party, so let's be patient. 
...I guess so. I'll just have to tough it out. 
Hey there, handsome. 
Can I ask you something? 
S-Sure. What is it? 
Is this the Grand Imperial Theater? 
Yes, it is... 
Thank you very much. Here's a little token of my appreciation. 
*mwah* 
Huh!? 
*GASP* 
Oh my, you're so shy. You're a cutie. I like that. 
Hey, are you free right now? Why don't we go someplace a little nicer? 
I'm working! 
I'd like to get to know you first. 
Yes, let's go! 
I'm working! 
I'd like to get to know you first. 
I'm working right now! I can't just leave! 
Besides, we've only just met. 
You're so cool, Mon Frère. 
Oh my, so uptight... I like you even more now. 
Er, what? 
I'd like to get to know you first... 
Are you for real? C'mon, Mon Frère, what are you saying? 
Get to know me? Mmmmm... OK, I'll tell you all about myself later. 
So how about we go someplace nice together? 
Er, um, well... I... 
No! Mon Frère is with me!! 
Oh my, I'm so sorry. I forgot all about you. 
... 
C'mon, say something, Mon Frère! 
S-Sorry. It was all so sudden... I don't know what to say. 
My, my... You're so innocent. And cute, too. 
Sure, let's go right now. I'd go anywhere with a beautiful lady like you! 
Mon Frère! We're getting ready for the welcome party! 
Oh dear. I must have offended your pretty little girlfriend there. 
That's too bad. Let's do this another time. 
Who are you, lady? Stop bothering Mon Frère! 
I'm sorry, sweetheart, I was just kidding. 
I'll see you around, "Mon Frère." 
What was with that lady? Everyone knows you're MY boyfriend! 
Huh... Just who was she, anyway? 
That woman from before, did she leave already? 
Come on, Mon Frère. What's so great about her, anyway? 
Y-You've got it all wrong, Iris. I was just wondering what she wanted. 
Now that you mention it, what WAS she doing here? 
That woman... What do you think she was here for? 
Was she the new member of the team? 
Was she a visitor? 
Was she a burglar? 
Was she the new member of the team? 
Was she a visitor? 
Was she a burglar? 
Was she the new member of the team? 
Was she a visitor? 
She was pretty, though, wasn't she? 
Perhaps that lady was our new team member? 
What!? You really think so? 
That was just a guess, but it's possible, isn't it? 
Hmmm, I'm starting to think so too. 
Maybe she was just a visitor? 
I think so too. 
She must have come to buy a photo or something. 
Could it be that she was a burglar? 
What?! 
M-Mon Frère... What if she really was a burglar? What do we do? 
On second thought, no thief would walk right in during the middle of the day. 
Y-Yeah, you're right! Whew, I was scared for a second. 
She was pretty, though, wasn't she? 
Mon Frère, you're my boyfriend, right? 
Don't go cheating on me! 
Oh, sorry. I shouldn't joke around so much. 
... 
What's wrong, Mon Frère? You got quiet all of a sudden. 
Oh, sorry. I was just thinking about who that girl was. 
Well, it's no use thinking about it too much. Let's go somewhere else. 
Yeah. Let's go, Mon Frère. 
That lady from before isn't here. 
What are you standing around here for, Mon Frère? Come onnnn, let's go! 
Ah... Sorry, I got sidetracked, didn't I? 
Hello, Yuri, Kasumi. 
Oh, Ogami! Have you heard? 
Yes, I have. 
...About what? 
About the new member, right? I just heard from the manager. 
What? You already know? 
Aww, it was a juicy story, too... Oh well. 
Heheh! Mon Frère beat you to it! 
...About what? 
Eheheh, well, you know... 
We're getting a new member for the troupe! 
Oh, you mean that? We're getting ready for the welcome party now. 
Oh my, you heard the news before Yuri. 
Oh gosh, you knew already? I thought I was the only one... 
Heheh, Mon Frère beat you to it! 
... 
I know! You mean the new girl, right? 
Oh gosh, even Iris knows? 
Aww, it was a juicy story, too... Oh well. 
Hahaha, that's too bad. We're preparing for the welcome party right now. 
So, everyone knew about it after all... You beat me this time. 
Hahaha, it's not the end of the world. 
You know her, she takes an awful lot of pride in her gossip. 
All right then, Ogami, do you want to hear about any other interesting rumors? 
Listen to a rumor. 
Tell them your business. 
Tell me some gossip. 
I'll come back later. 
So about the new member coming today... 
I hear she's a former member of the European Star Division, just like Orihime. 
Oh, if she used to be in the Star Division, that must mean she's an experienced pilot. 
I wonder what she's like? I'm getting excited just thinking about it! 
Ok, so listen, there's a new clerical worker coming to the theater. 
So she's going to work in this office with you two? 
No, the new person won't be working in the office. 
Huh? What do you mean? 
She's going to work as a secretary for Mr. Yoneda! 
Ogami, have you ever heard Orihime play the piano? 
I heard it the other day when I was passing the music room. 
Orihime's piano skills, they were so elegant and beautiful. 
I didn't expect that from her! 
Oh, Yuri. It's not unexpected at all. 
Orihime is a very nice, sensitive, and polite girl. 
Wh-Whaaaat?! Sensitive? Polite? 
...And very nice? 
That's right. Remember, Ogami, Orihime is still new to the theater... 
So please, try to take care of her. 
S-Sure... 
Oh, by the way, Ogami, I heard you got some communication device from Kohran. 
Communication device? Oh, you mean the Cinematron. 
It's an amazing invention. You can actually see the other person's face while you're talking to them. 
Wow, that sounds great. Maybe I'll ask Kohran to make one for me. 
Kohran and I joined the troupe around the same time. I'd love to talk to her about the Hanayashiki Branch. 
Oh, Ogami, I hear that Orihime's been giving you a hard time. She really dislikes you. 
You must have done something to make her hate you, right? 
O-Of course not! 
Besides, Orihime says she hates all Japanese men. 
Huh... It sounds like she's got her reasons. 
Maybe she got rejected by a Japanese guy once. Yeah, that must be it! 
I wonder what kind of relationships she's had with Japanese men before getting here. 
Now, Yuri, you're assuming that she's been in a relationship with one, aren't you? 
Remember, Orihime is a bit younger than the other girls in the Flower Division. 
Oh, but age is just a number when it comes to love. 
I'm sure she's been rejected, and that's why she doesn't like Japanese men. Oh, poor thing... 
By the way, I read in this morning's issue of the Capital Daily Report... 
...that a large part of Tokyo Bay is going to be reclaimed. 
Oh, so there's more land for us to use. 
Wow, Kasumi, you read the newspaper? There's so many words in there. 
I only read fashion magazines... 
Well, nowadays, women are working in society just like men. 
You need to be more aware of current events, Yuri. 
Heheh, I already know what's going on in society from my magazines. I'll pass on the newspapers. 
Ogami, the renovations for the basement are finally done. You can go down there, now. 
Oh yeah, Ogami, speaking of the basement, we also got a big bathroom now. 
Wow, that's great. I can rest and relax in there, now. 
Heehe, just don't peek on anyone in the bath, OK, Ogami? 
Iris, you seem happy to be with Ogami today, don't you? 
Uh-huh! That's because I'm his girlfriend! 
I see. You're a smooth one, aren't you, Ogami? 
Ogami and Iris, getting closer... Ooh, this is the best gossip I've had in ages! 
H-Hey, hey! Don't spread rumors like that all willy-nilly! 
It's OK, Mon Frère! It's the truth! 
Oh? 
Did you buy Maria's photo, Ogami? 
I figured I'd buy her photo since we're so far apart for now. 
Buying her photo because she's so far away? That's so sad! 
I know! I'll give you her contact number! 
Huh? R-Really?! 
Of course! You ready? Maria's number is "13900." 
If you dial 13900 on the Cinematron, you can talk to Maria. 
This is Maria we're talking about, so I don't think she's lonely or anything... 
But since you two are so far apart, why don't you show your face to her for a bit? 
I think I will. Thanks, Yuri. 
Oh? 
Ogami, you bought Kanna's photo, didn't you? 
I figured I'd buy her photo since we're so far apart for now. 
Right. The theater seems to have lost its pizzazz without Kanna. 
I know, Ogami, I'll tell you her contact number! 
Huh? R-Really?! 
Of course! You ready? Kanna's number is "14000." 
If you dial 14000 on the Cinematron, you can talk to Kanna. 
You do want to hear Kanna's cheerful voice, right, Ogami? 
Yeah, of course. Thanks, Yuri. 
Oh? 
You bought Sumire's photo, didn't you? 
Yeah. You know how Sumire's back at home for now? 
I figured I should at least get her photo, in the meantime. 
Wow, I didn't take you for a romantic, Ogami. I had no idea. 
No, no, that's not what I meant. 
Heehee, you don't have to be shy. 
Hey, I know, I'll give you Sumire's contact number! 
Huh? R-Really?! 
Of course! You ready? Sumire's number is "13800." 
If you dial 13800 on the Cinematron, you can get through to Sumire. 
Take your time, Ogami. 
All right, got it. Thank you, Yuri. 
More importantly, Sakura asked me to come get you guys. 
We're having a welcome party for the new recruit backstage at noon, so you all should come. 
Is that so? Thank you for coming all this way. 
We take our lunch break at noon, so we'll pay you all a visit then. 
I wonder what kind of person this newcomer is? Ohhhh, I can't wait for it to be noon! 
Well, we'll see you at 12 o'clock. Good luck with the rest of your work. 
See ya later! Bye-bye! 
I'll be back. Good luck with the rest of your work. 
Alrighty! Please do your best to prepare for the welcome party, you two. 
Yep! See you later, Auntie Yuri! 
Oh, Ogami. Is there something you need? 
If you want, I can tell you some interesting gossip. 
Oh Ogami. Thank you for preparing the welcome party. 
If you're asking about rumors, I'm all out. Sorry. 
I see. That's too bad. 
I'll have some more interesting tidbits for you some other time, so look forward to it! 
OK, don't forget to meet us backstage at noon. 
Yeah, we know. Come back soon. 
I'm sorry, I'm all out of things to gossip about. 
I see. That's too bad. 
I'll have some more interesting tidbits for you some other time, so look forward to it! 
Mr. Yoneda... I wonder if he's in? 
...I think we should go somewhere else. 
Oh, you're not going to see him? 
Uncle Yoneda isn't there, huh? 
Maybe he's still in the Command Room. 
It's Ogami. 
Sorry, can you come back later? 
...Yes, sir. Understood. 
Oh well. Come on, Mon Frère. 
It's Ogami. Mr. Yoneda, are you there? 
Ogami? Door's open. 
OK sir, I'm coming in. 
Uncle Yoneda, we're all getting ready for the welcome party. 
O-Oh, I see... That's great, Iris. 
... 
Uncle Yoneda? 
Mon Frère, I wonder what's wrong with Uncle Yoneda. 
He's not his usual cheerful self. 
Iris... 
Let's ask him why. 
You see, it's about that Yamazaki guy... 
Let's leave him be. 
He must not be doing well. Let's ask him what's wrong. 
OK... 
Mr. Yoneda. You're not looking so good, is something the matter? 
...What did you say? 
Did you bring Iris all the way here just to ask me that? 
I'm busy. If you don't need anything, then get out. 
Y-Yes, sir. Excuse me, sir. 
I think you made him mad, Mon Frère... 
I guess I shouldn't have asked... 
Oh well, can't do anything about that now. Let's go somewhere else. 
Well, Mr. Yoneda has been thinking about Yamazaki- 
Oy, Ogami! Not another word! 
I'm busy! If you don't need me, then get out! 
Oh... E-Excuse me, sir! I'll be going! 
I think you made him mad, Mon Frère... 
Let's go. There's no point in staying here. 
...Let's just leave him be, Iris. 
People can have a lot of things on their mind, you know? 
...OK, I get it. 
We're gonna go now, Uncle Yoneda... 
We're holding a welcome party for the new member at noon. You should come too. 
...Ah, right, right. Got it. Thanks, Iris. 
Well, Mr. Yoneda, if you'll excuse us. 
Come on, Iris. Let's go somewhere else. 
OK, Mon Frère. 
... 
Iris, we're still in the middle of getting the party ready, so let's get going. 
What? We just got here and now we're leaving? 
Yeah. Let's go. 
Well, Mr. Yoneda, if you'll excuse us. 
...Mhmm. 
You left without talking to him? That's weird. 
...It's all right, Iris. 
Come on, let's go. We don't have much time left before noon. 
Wow, there's always so many costumes in here. 
Hey, Mon Frère, it'd be so nice if they made a stage costume for you to wear. 
Hahaha, no way. I'm not an actor... 
Oh, Mon Frère, did you forget something? We were just here earlier. 
N-No... I just kinda wandered in here. 
We don't need anything here, so let's go. 
...There's no one here. 
There's no use staying here. Let's go to another room. 
Oh, it's Orihime! She's playing the piano. 
Hi, Orihime. 
...Oh, it's you. And Iris, too? 
How's it going with the party preparations? 
We're almost done. 
Hmm... I think it's going to take a little bit longer. 
Orihime, were you practicing the piano? 
I wasn't practicing. My technique is already perfect. 
I play the piano to enhance my imagination. 
Imagination is very important for acting on stage. 
That's so like you. 
Don't you ever practice your lines? 
I see, that's so like you, Orihime. I guess everyone has their own way of doing things. 
Oh, that's surprising, coming from you. That's exactly right. 
The best way to do anything is whichever way best suits you, that's what I think. 
That's why I don't see any point in practicing my lines, either. 
I see. You've got a point. 
So is that why you don't practice your lines? 
Yeah, it's important to practice! 
I'll practice my dance moves with everyone else, of course. 
But when it comes to enhancing my imagination, I do things my way. 
I think the best way to do anything is whichever way best suits you. 
That's why I don't see any point in practicing my lines, either. 
I see. You've got a point. 
It must be a hard concept for you to understand. 
...I've lost all my focus ever since you came in here. 
I'm out of here. 
Oh, Orihime! 
*sigh* She's gone. 
Sheesh. Orihime still marching to the beat of her own drum, eh? 
Nothing we can do about it. Let's go, Iris. 
OK! 
There's no one here. 
Let's go somewhere else. 
Ok, let's go, Mon Frère! 
Oh, Ogami, did you bring the plates from the kitchen? 
Oh... Sorry, not yet. 
C'mon, Mon Frère! Let's hurry up and get them. 
A-All right. I'm off, Sakura. 
Sakuraaa! We brought the plates! 
Thank you, Iris. Can you leave them there? 
Here you go! 
What do you plan on doing now, Ogami? 
I'll wait here. 
I've still got places to check out. 
I'll wait here. There's nothing else to do. 
Then I'll stay here, too! 
OK, we'll wait for the others to get back, then. 
I still need to check some other places out first. 
Ok, I understand. Just be back here by 12 o'clock. 
Yes, of course. 
I'll come along, too! 
Hahaha, all right, let's go, Iris. 
OK! 
Oh, Ogami, have you talked to Kasumi and Tsubaki, yet? 
Yes, I told them about the welcome party. 
Already taken care of, Sakura! 
Thank you very much! You saved me a lot of time. 
What do you plan on doing now, Ogami? 
I'll wait here. 
I've still got places to check out. 
I'll wait here. There's nothing else to do. 
Then I'll stay here, too! 
OK, we'll wait for the others to get back, then. 
I still need to check some other places out first. 
Ok, I understand. Just be back here by 12 o'clock. 
Yes, of course. 
I'll come along, too! 
Hahaha. All right, let's go, Iris. 
OK! 
Oh, Ogami, have you talked to Kasumi and Tsubaki yet? 
Oh... Sorry, not yet. 
We still have some time, so if you could please do that. 
Oh, Ogami, what's the matter? 
Nothing, I just thought everyone would be here by now. 
No, not yet. There's still time before the party, after all. 
If you need anything, please let me know. 
I see. Well then, Iris, shall we go? 
OK! 
Where is everybody? If they don't hurry, our new member will show up before them! 
We still have time, Iris, don't worry. 
I wonder if we got here too early? 
Oh, you're all here. Boy, you guys are fast. 
I thought I'd be the first one here, but wow, you're fast. 
It was all thanks to Ogami and Iris's help. 
Excuse us! 
Oh, everyone, welcome. 
Hurry up! Let's start the welcome party! 
Looks like everything's all ready. 
I thought I'd be the first one here, but wow, you're fast. 
It was all thanks to Ogami and Iris's help. 
...Nobody's here. 
We're not in the middle of a performance, so that's why there's no one here. 
Let's go, Iris. 
No one's here. Let's go somewhere else. 
Whoa, it's a mess back here, the set and the props are all scattered around. 
We'll have to clean up before our next performance... 
It's so messy, hide-and-seek would be really tough in this room. 
Well, it certainly does look like a storage room in here. 
I can't wait to see all the members of the Flower Division on this stage. 
We're putting on our summer performance next month, so don't you worry! 
The summer performance, huh? Can't wait. 
It's so sad seeing the stage so empty right now. 
...Let's go. 
It's so creepy to be in an empty auditorium like this. 
Aah! Mon Frère, behind you! 
HUH?! What is it!? 
Heheheh. Just kidding! 
D-Don't scare me like that, Iris. 
These seats will be filled with people once the show starts. 
OK, let's go. 
Ah, it's a beautiful day. 
Yep, being outside on a day like this is the greatest. 
Hmm, I agree. If I could, I'd take a nap out here. 
But we'd be late for the welcome party. Let's go, Iris. 
Ok, Mon Frère. 
Ah, it's so warm. It feels so good! 
I know, Mon Frère, let's take a nap! 
We can't, Iris. We'd end up late for the welcome party! 
Oh yeah. OK, let's go somewhere else, then! 
Oh, Mon Frère, let me see your watch! 
5 minutes to go until it's 12. The welcome party is about to start! 
It's that time already? OK, we need to rush back, then. 
Wooooow. From up here, I can see the street in front of the theater. 
I wonder if the new girl will be coming down that path. 
Hmm. We'll be able to see her from up here. 
Ooh! Hehehe, I've got a great idea! 
What's this great idea you got? 
That's. A. Secret! I'll tell you in a bit. Come on, let's go somewhere else. 
I hope the new girl will arrive soon. And then I... 
And then...? 
Hehehe. Still a secret! 
It's really quiet without a show being put on. 
There's no audience. I can't wait to do a play for them. 
There's won't be very many visitors this month. It's so quiet without them. 
No one seems to be here. Let's go. 
Ogami. 
Oh, Sakura. Did you find Orihime? 
Yes! I was on my way to the music room and bumped into her. 
It's thanks to your help I was able to find her. 
Really? That's great. Did Orihime help you out? 
Yes. I asked her, and she said "I understand." 
(I don't know. I feel like she's just saying that.) 
Well, I still have things to get ready, so gotta go. 
Hey, Mon Frère. Let's go somewhere else. 
OK, let's go. 
Well, she wasn't in the music room. 
I see. I'm sorry, I must have given you the wrong information... 
I'm still getting things ready, so I need to get going. 
Hey, Mon Frère. Let's go somewhere else. 
OK, let's go. 
Yes! Just a moment ago. We bumped into each other in front of her room. 
It's thanks to your help I was able to find her. 
Really? That's great. Did Orihime help you out? 
Yes. I asked her, and she said "I understand." 
(I don't know. I feel like she's just saying that.) 
Well, I still have things to get ready, so I gotta go. 
Hey, Mon Frère. Let's go somewhere else. 
OK, let's go. 
Well, she wasn't in her room... 
I see. I'm sorry, I must have given you the wrong information... 
I'm still getting things ready, so I need to get going. 
Hey, Mon Frère. Let's go somewhere else. 
OK, let's go. 
Yes, we bumped into each other in front of the stairs a moment ago. 
It's thanks to your help I was able to find her. 
Really? That's great. Did Orihime help you out? 
She actually got really upset when I said you told me she was in the attic. 
Did something happen? 
Orihime probably wanted you to keep it a secret. 
Ah, yeah... Oops. 
Well, I still have things to get ready, so I gotta go. 
Hey, Mon Frère. Let's go somewhere else. 
OK, let's go. 
Hmm, she wasn't in the attic. 
I see. I'm sorry, I must have given you the wrong information... 
I'm still getting things ready, so I need to get going. 
Hey, Mon Frère. Let's go somewhere else. 
OK, let's go. 
No... I couldn't find her. 
But, Orihime... She's helping out somewhere. 
(Hmm.... I sure hope she is.) 
Well, I still have things to get ready, so I gotta go. 
Hey, Mon Frère. Let's go somewhere else. 
OK, let's go. 
For once in Iris's life I'd like to see my performance from here. 
Hahaha... I see. But it's not so easy. 
There's no one here. 
Let's go to the other room, Iris. 
Yeah. 
Oh, Ogami. 
What's wrong, Sakura? 
Have you two seen Orihime? 
I thought I'd ask her for help, so I'm looking for her. 
She was in the music room. 
She was in her room. 
She was in the attic. 
If it's Orihime you need, I just saw her in the music room. 
I see. Thank you very much. I'll take a look. 
I think she was in the music room. Well... Maybe. 
I see. Thank you very much. I'll take a look. 
Orihime's in her room. 
I see. Thank you very much. I'll go look. 
I think she's in her room. Well... Maybe. 
I see. Thank you very much. I'll go look. 
Orihime's in the attic. 
I see. Thank you very much. I'll go look. 
I think she was in the attic. Well... Maybe. 
I see. Thank you very much. I'll go look. 
I'm sorry, I don't know where she is. 
I see. Thanks anyway. I'll go look for her some more. 
I should go, then. Keep it up, you two. 
Yeah. See you later. 
Nobody's here. 
Let's go somewhere else. We don't have much time before noon. 
Yeah! Come on, Mon Frère. 
I hate this room! I can't reach up there! 
Mon Frère, let's go to another room! 
O-OK, got it. Let's go, Iris. 
I thought Orihime might be here, but it doesn't look like it. 
Let's go somewhere else. We don't have much time before noon. 
Yay! It's Mon Frère's room! 
Hahaha. Come on in. 
Huh? What's that machine, Mon Frère? 
Oh, this? It's a communication device called the Cinematron. 
I can use it talk to people from far away. 
Wow, that's so cool! Hey, Mon Frère, let me see! 
Hey, Mon Frère, are you going to call someone? 
What should I do... 
Make a call. 
Maybe next time. 
OK, then. Let's do it. 
Yay! C'mon, hurry! 
We don't have much time. Let's do it another day. 
Boo... That's boring. 
Well, we shouldn't be playing around with this while Sakura and the others are getting ready, right? 
Oh, OK. I'll wait, then. 
That's good to hear, Iris. Let's go. 
...This was Ayame's room, wasn't it? 
We may never see Ayame again... 
But she'll always be in our hearts. Isn't that right, Iris? 
Yeah... That's right. 
All right, let's go. Ayame will get mad at us for looking so sad. 
Let's go, Iris. We've got other things to do now. 
There's no one here. 
There's no use staying here. Let's go to another room. 
Huh? Why is Orihime here? 
You're right. Orihime, what's wrong? 
Hey, Orihime! What are you doing? 
Eek!! 
W-What do you want from me? 
No, it's not like that... 
Hey, Orihime. What are you doing up here? 
I-It's none of your business. Why do you care? 
If you don't need me for anything, then I'll be leaving. 
Ah, Orihime! W-Wait! 
...She's gone. 
What was she doing up here, anyway? 
Hmm, I'm curious, but I don't think she's going to tell us. 
Anyway, let's go back downstairs. There's no point in staying up here. 
Orihime's gone. I wonder what she was doing just now. 
I don't know. Let's go back downstairs for now. 
What kind of books do you like, Iris? 
Well, I like books with lots of pretty pictures. 
Hahaha, I see. I'll read some to you later. 
Maria's always reading in here. 
That sure sounds like Maria. I'm sure she's reading a lot of books in New York. 
I wonder if this is the new girl's room. 
When Orihime came, she had so much stuff delivered to her room. 
Nothing seems to have come in today. 
Maybe she doesn't keep very many things in her room. 
There's no one here, yet, Mon Frère. Let's go. 
Yeah, I guess so. Let's go to aother room. 
I wonder if Sakura's in her room? 
(What a cute, girlish nameplate.) 
Hey, Mon Frère, aren't you supposed to be helping Sakura? 
Sakura's getting ready for the welcome party. I'm sure she wouldn't be in her room. 
Then we probably shouldn't have come here in the first place. 
Doesn't look like Sakura is here. 
She's been preparing for the welcome party. I guess she's not in her room. 
OK, we should get going, too. 
Kanna's gone to Okinawa for training. She's not here right now. 
But if Kanna was here, the preparations for the welcome party would have been over quick. 
Indeed... The hard work would have been done in no time. 
Kanna... I hope she'll come home soon. 
She'll be back in summer right? Summer's right around the corner. 
...Yeah, I guess so. 
Orihime... Is she in her room? 
This is Orihime's name plate. 
Hey, Mon Frère, did you need Orihime for something? 
No... I figured we probably shouldn't disturb her. 
Come on, Iris. 
...She's not here. 
Orihime said she was going somewhere, right? 
Hmmm, now that you mention it, that's right. 
Hey there, Orihime. I was just about to knock on your door. 
Ensign? 
I have nothing to talk to you about. 
I have stuff to do so I'll be off. 
Ah... Orihime! 
Orihime... She's gone. 
Oh, well... Let's go, Iris. 
...Who's there? Orihime's not here. 
Oh, she's still not home... 
Then who is this? 
Oh, she's still not home... 
Mon Frère! You just heard her, of course she's home! 
O-Oh, I see... You're right. 
Hmph! You must really be hopeless if even Iris is making fun of you. 
I can't believe you fell for that. You're pretty stupid, aren't you? 
S-Stupid?! 
*sigh* I still can't believe a guy like you is the captain of the Flower Division. 
Then, prepare for the welcome party. 
Ah, Orihime... 
Whose voice is that, then? 
You're in there, aren't you, Orihime? Open the door! 
...Ugh! You're so obnoxious! 
Ensign? Iris? What do you want? 
Orihime, you're in there, aren't you? Come on, open the door! 
Oh, is that you, Iris? Just a second... 
Ah! Ensign?! I thought Iris was alone! 
You're in there, aren't you, Orihime? You shouldn't pretend you're out when you're not. 
If there's anyone who'd fall for that trick, I'd like to meet him. 
That's right! Hey, Orihime. Let me see what's in your room. 
...My room? 
I still haven't seen what your room looks like! Can I? Please? 
Well, if you want to see it so badly, then I guess I don't have a choice. 
Fine, I'll let you see it, just this once. 
Yaaaay! Coming iiiin! 
Wowww... What a beautiful room! 
I understand why you'd be gawking at my room... 
But you can't stay here too long, so please leave before too long, OK? 
What's this...? 
It's an interior design that also serves as curtains. 
It uses the flag of a certain country as a motif. Do you know what flag, Ensign? 
It's the flag of France. 
It's the flag of Italy. 
It's the flag of England. 
It's the flag of France. Isn't it famous for the tricolor flag? 
Wrong! Japanese men really are stupid. 
It's based on the flag of my home country, Italy. 
Mon Frère. The French flag is blue, white, and red. 
R-Really? That was careless of me. 
It's the Italian flag. That's where you're from, right, Orihime? 
Well, you seem to know your stuff, despite being a Japanese man. 
That's Mon Frère for you! He's so smart. 
I'm pretty sure it's... the British flag, right? 
That's not it at all. Japanese men really are stupid. 
It's based on the flag of my home country, Italy. 
R-Really? That was careless of me. 
...Which flag is it? 
It's based on the flag of my home country, Italy. 
Frankly speaking, that sort of thing should be common knowledge. 
(Decorating with the curtains like this sure makes for an interesting layout.) 
(What a fancy-looking bed. Is that what Orihime sleeps on...?) 
Don't stare at people's beds like that! 
Oh... S-Sorry. 
How many times do I have to tell you?! 
You keep staring and staring and staring at my bed! You're so shameless! 
Get out of here! 
O-Orihime! Wait a minute... 
I'm not listening! Hurry up and get out! 
I knew letting a Japanese man into my room was a mistake. Now goodbye! 
Mon Frère... She kicked us out. 
Oh well. Let's go to another room. 
(A mirror stand, huh? There's some expensive cosmetics there.) 
Hey, Orihime! Teach me how to put on make up, too. 
I don't think there's any point for a child like Iris to wear makeup. 
HEYYY! I'm not a little kid! 
(There's a photo frame...) 
What's this picture? 
I can't show you this picture, Ensign. 
What? Why not? Let me see it, Orihime. 
No means no! Don't touch it! 
Pick it up 
(There's a beautiful woman in the picture...) 
Don't touch people's things without permission! 
Oh... I'm sorry. I just couldn't help myself. 
Seriously, the nerve of Japanese men! They really have no sense of decency! 
Get out of here! 
O-Orihime! Wait a minute... 
I'm not listening! Hurry up and get out! 
I knew letting a Japanese man into my room was a mistake. Now goodbye! 
Mon Frère... She kicked us out. 
Oh well. Let's go to another room. 
(No... I guess I'll give up) 
Aw... I wanted to see... 
(Seems she hates it so I guess I'll give up) 
(A landscape? Where is it from?) 
This is a landscape of my hometown. 
Huh, really? 
(I wonder what kind of place Orihime's hometown is?) 
Wow! What a pretty painting! 
You've got good taste if that picture caught your eye. 
This is a piece painted by Renoir. 
Renoir? Is that someone famous? 
He's a famous painter. 
By the way, Ensign, speaking of Renoir... 
Do you know what movement he belonged to? 
Impressionist, I think. 
Romanticist, I think. 
Direct style, of course! 
Impressionist, I think. 
Romanticist, I think. 
Uhh... Playful style? 
He was... An Impressionist, right? 
Wow, you're pretty knowledgeable. 
I have a tiiiiiiny bit more respect for you now, Ensign. 
You really know everything, Mon Frère! 
He was... A Romanticist, right? 
Wow, I'm surprised you know about that. 
But you're wrong. Renoir was an Impressionist. 
Oh... Is that right? 
Wow, there's stuff even you don't know, Mon Frère. 
Direct style, of course! A real hardliner, as all men should be! 
...Ensign? Do you even know what I'm asking about? 
Renoir was an impressionist. You really have no common sense at all, Ensign. Non ha senso! 
Uhhh... Playful style? 
Even if you were joking, Ensign, that's not funny. 
It's the only thing I could think of... 
Renoir was an impressionist. You really have no common sense at all, Ensign. Non ha senso! 
...Hmm. I don't know much about painting. 
I'll tell you, then. Renoir was what is called an Impressionist. 
You should study art some more, Ensign. 
(When I look at a good painting I just feel... so calm.) 
This luxury chandelier I brought is Italian-made! 
You brought that all the way from Italy? That's amazing. 
(Made in Italy... They sure make them different overseas.) 
Iris, I think we should get going. 
Yeah, OK. Let's go, Mon Frère. 
Thank you for showing us your room. Maybe you can invite us over again sometime? 
Don't push your luck. Today was an exception because Iris was with you. 
Well then, I have things I need to do, so I'll be going. 
We should go, too, Iris. 
OK! 
Ensign... Are you just going to loiter around here or what? 
Right. We should get going, Iris. 
Yeah. Thanks for showing us your room, Orihime. 
You two should make a note of my immaculate taste for future reference. 
Thank you for showing us your room. Maybe you can invite us over again sometime? 
Don't push your luck. Today was an exception because Iris was with you. 
Well then, I have things I need to do, so I'll be going. 
We should go, too, Iris. 
OK! 
Maria's in America... That's so far away... 
Hey, Mon Frère, which is farther from here, France or America? 
Hmm. France might be farther, if we go by boat. 
Hmm... I hope Maria comes back soon. 
Yeah... Come on, Iris, let's go somewhere else. 
This is Maria's room. She's in America right now. 
There's no point in staying here. Let's go, Mon Frère. 
Hey, Mon Frère. Don't you wanna see my new room? 
Huh? Are you sure? 
Yeah! Come in! 
OK, I'll drop in. Just for a second, though, since we're still preparing for the welcoming party. 
Welcome to my room, Mon Frère! 
Hahaha, all right then, show me around a little. 
You sure have a lot of stuffed animals. 
Heh heh. They're all my dear friends! 
Wow, so they must all have names, huh? 
Of course they do! I'll introduce you. 
This is Anjou, and this is Lune, Paul, François... 
And this is, uh... Oh, that's right! 
I only just got this bunny, so he doesn't have a name yet. 
Can you give this one a name, Mon Frère? 
Hmmm... This is tough. 
What about Marie? 
How about Pierre? 
How about Hogehoge? 
How about "Marie"? 
What? That's a girl's name! This one's a boy! 
I played a girl named Marie on stage before! 
W-Well, it's cute, so that should still be fine, right? 
Y-You think so? 
Let's go with Marie, Iris. 
Hmmm... OK, then! I'll name him Marie! 
Well... How about "Pierre"? 
Wow! That's so cool! I'll go with that, Mon Frère! 
That's his name, then. Pierre! 
Thanks for giving him such a cool name, Mon Frère! 
Hmm... What about "Hogehoge"? 
Hogehoge? What does that mean? I have no idea! 
There isn't really a meaning. I just thought of it on the spot. 
I'll call him Hogehoge, then! It sounds funny. 
Starting today, you are Hogehoge. Nice to meet you, Hogehoge. 
Thanks for giving him such a funny name, Mon Frère! 
Hmm, I can't think of a good name... 
I know! I'll give him your name, "Ichiro"! 
Huh? I guess I don't mind, but... 
Yeah, of course! OK, his name will be Ichiro, then! 
You can properly introduce yourself the next time you come to my room. 
(Iris sure loves stuffed animals, huh?) 
That's a big chest of drawers. Is it all clothes in there? 
Yep, that's right. I love clothes. 
Heheh... Mon Frère. Which of my clothes do you like best? 
I like the one you're wearing now. 
I think I like your battle uniform. 
It's not the clothes that make a person attractive. 
I like the one you're wearing now. 
I think I like your battle uniform. 
I like your swimsuit. 
I like the one you're wearing now. 
I think I like your battle uniform. 
I'd rather you wear nothing at all... 
I like what you're wearing right now. It looks really good on you. 
Yeah! This is my favorite outfit, too. 
Thank you, Mon Frère! I'm so happy! 
I'd say your battle uniform. It's so cool and sleek. 
Thanks, Mon Frère. Eheheh, I'm so happy! 
Your battle suit is also really cool! 
Iris, a person's charm is not determined by their clothes. 
Hmm... I guess. Boring... 
I like swimsuits. I want to see you in a swimsuit. 
Huh?! That's bold of you, Mon Frère. 
OK then, I'll show you my swimsuit in the summer! 
I... I'd rather you wear nothing at all... 
Mon Frère, if you don't take this seriously, I'm gonna get mad! 
Oh... S-Sorry. Uhh... Which one's the best... 
Oh, never mind! You're such a perv, Mon Frère! 
... 
Oh, I get it! I look good in anything, so you don't know what to say, huh? 
Huh? I-I guess so. 
(So, Iris's various clothes are in here...) 
(Does Iris sleep together with Jean-Paul?) 
Iris, is Jean-Paul with you when you go to bed, too? 
Yep! Jean-Paul and I are always together. 
Even in the bath? 
Jean-Paul's a boy, so we can't take baths together. 
I-I see... 
(That's a huge pillow...) 
(That's a huge cushion...) 
That's a huge pillow. It looks so comfortable. 
That's called a "cushion", Mon Frère. 
Huh, really? 
(This looks like a picture of Iris's parents.) 
Hey Iris, what's this picture? 
That's my papa and mama. 
They told me to look at this picture whenever I feel lonely. 
That way I'm never lonely! 
I'm always with my papa and mama whenever I'm in this room. 
I see... 
(That's a nice smelling flower. I wonder what it's called?) 
This flower smells really nice. What's its name? 
Hmmm.... What's it called, again...? 
I'm sorry, I forgot. Orihime gave it to me. What was it called, anyway? 
Huh, Orihime gave you that flower? That's surprising. 
(I wonder how this curtain opens up.) 
How do you open this curtain? 
Oh, this? It lifts up, like a stage curtain. 
Wow... That's strange. 
(It's an unusual but stylish curtain.) 
We should get back to getting ready for the welcome party. 
Thanks for inviting me in, Iris. 
Sure! I hope you'll come again! 
Oh, is it that time already? 
Thanks for inviting me in, Iris. 
Sure! I hope you'll come again! 
We were just here, Mon Frère. 
We're preparing for the welcome party. Let's go somewhere else. 
...I guess so. Let's go, then. 
Kohran would definitely liven up the welcome party if she were here. 
She'd make some kind of new machine and make a big commotion. 
I'm tired of the explosions, though. 
Mon Frère, Kohran's not here cause she's at the Hanayashiki Branch. 
Oh, that's right. Totally slipped my mind. 
Sumire went back home, right? 
Yeah, but she said she'll be back soon. 
That's right. I'm sure it'll be even more lively around here once Sumire gets back. 
I hope Sumire comes back soon. 
Yeah. I hope the day comes soon where everyone in the Flower Division will be back together again. 
Oh, Mon Frère, let me see your watch! 
5 minutes to go until it's 12. The welcome party is about to start! 
It's that time already? OK, we need to rush back, then. 
Are you still here, sir? 
Ogami? Just the man I wanted to see. I've got a question for ya. 
Sorry, Iris, but could you wait outside for a moment? 
Huh? Boooriiiing. I'm staying right here! 
Sorry, Iris. We won't be long. 
Boo. All right. 
What is it you wanted to ask me, sir? 
Yamazaki attacked us specifically... And not just him, but that masked man, too. 
You know what that means? To them, we're a thorn in their side. 
Yeah. In order to bring chaos to the capital, they have to take out the Imperial Assault Troupe first. 
Exactly. So, if it were up to you, what would you do to beat the enemy this time? 
I'd attack the enemy's base. 
I'd fortify the Imperial Theater's defenses. 
I'd gather information on the enemy. 
I would attack the enemy's base. A good offense is the best defense. 
Oh? But we don't even know where they are. Where the hell do you plan on going? 
Uh, well... 
Remember this. There's no point in recklessly attacking. 
Attack when the right opportunity comes. That way you'll achieve the greatest results with the least amount of force. 
Yes, sir. I understand. 
I'd fortify the theater's defenses. We don't know when the enemy will strike. 
Oh? Even if the capital is reduced to ashes? What will we be defending then? 
Uh, well... 
Ogami, it's true that protecting the Imperial Theater is also important. 
But our mission is to protect the capital. Never forget that. 
...Yes, sir. I understand. 
I'd gather information on the enemy. If you know your enemy and know yourself, you can fight a hundred battles without fear. 
Oh? Really now? So where are you going to get this intel, and how? 
Uh, well... 
Gathering information is the foundation of strategy, but that's not the Flower Division's job. 
The Imperial Assault Troupe has a secret intelligence unit called the Moon Division. 
If we leave it up to them, we're bound to get some information sooner or later. 
Ogami, I understand your frustration at not knowing who our enemy is, but you have to calm down. 
...Yes, sir. I understand. 
I don't know. So... I'd wait for now. 
Oh, and then? 
If we don't know who the enemy is, we can't make any move. 
Heh, you're starting to understand what strategy is, aren't you? 
For now, we have to patiently hold out for the right opportunity. 
...Yes, sir. I understand. 
Wait for the right moment, look for the right opportunity, fight with all your spirit. Do that and you'll never lose. 
Don't let the tragedy of losing your friends repeat itself... 
...Yes, sir. 
Well, I'm off. Say hi to Iris for me. 
Manager Yoneda... 
Hey, Mon Frère. Are you finished talking? 
Uncle Yoneda was looking kinda sad. Is he OK? 
It's OK, Iris, don't worry about it. All right, let's go. 
Manager Yoneda... I guess he's not here anymore. 
Let's go to another room, Mon Frère. 
So this is the troupe's prized steam processor... 
Uncle Yoneda said there are only two or three of them in Japan. 
This and the command center next door are the heart of the Assault Troupe. 
Even with this steam processor, we still don't know anything about our enemy, do we? 
Demon King"... Who the hell is he? 
This is... the infirmary, eh? 
If you're injured, this is where you can get treated. 
If you get hurt badly, you can go to the intensive care unit in the back. 
But the ICU is usually off-limits. 
I see... I'll keep that in mind. 
I hate this disinfectant smell! 
Hahaha. Let's go, then. 
Look, Mon Frère. This is the new bathroom. 
It used to be a shower room, but they rebuilt it and turned it into a bath. 
Stretching your arms and legs out as you soak in the tub feels so revitalizing. 
Yep! The tub's so big, it makes me want to go swimming in it! 
Doesn't it make you wanna swim too, Mon Frère? 
Well... 
It makes me want to swim. 
It makes me want to sing. 
It makes me want to swim. 
It makes me want to take a peek inside. 
It makes me want to sing. 
It's so big, it makes me want to swim, too. 
You too, Mon Frère? Eheheh, we're on the same page! 
But when I took a bath with Sakura the other day, she got mad at me for swimming. 
She said "go in the pool next door if you want to swim." 
I see... Yeah, that's true. 
It makes me want to sing. It feels great to sing in the bath. 
Uncle Yoneda sings a lot when he takes a bath, too. 
Maybe I'll try singing next time? 
It... makes me want to take a peek inside... 
You're so gross, Mon Frère! 
I hate it when you say that! 
Oh... Kidding, just kidding. Don't be so mad, Iris. 
I'm not really into swimming... 
Nothing feels better than taking your time and washing yourself off in peace. 
I always make sure to count to ten before I get out of the bath, too. 
Hahaha, I see. If you don't warm up properly, you'll catch a cold. 
I'll take a bath later. Let's go somewhere else, Mon Frère. 
Yeah, you're right. Let's go. 
There's still nobody in the bath, Mon Frère. 
That's right. Let's go. 
This is the changing room. This is where you change when you go to the pool or bath. 
I see... 
Don't peek in the bath, Mon Frère! 
Why do you keep coming to the changing room? 
You're not thinking of something nasty, are you? 
No, not at all. I just happened to come here, that's all. 
Look, Mon Frère! We got a new pool. 
It's got warm water, too, so you can swim even in winter. 
I heard it also has training mines! 
I see... It's cutting edge, just as you'd expect from the troupe. 
Do you like the pool, Iris? 
Yeah, I love it! My feet don't reach the bottom, though, so I have to use a pool ring... 
But I can swim halfway across the pool without one! 
Wow, that's amazing. You're doing great, Iris. 
Heheh, yep! 
So this is the training room... Iris, you want to work out a bit? 
Hmmm... Maybe later. We have the welcome party today. 
You're right. We'll do this some other time. 
We were just here, Mon Frère. Did you need something? 
No... No, not really. Let's go, then. 
Oh, it's Sakura. 
Oh, Ogami, Iris. 
What's up? What are you doing here? 
I'm looking for some decorations for the welcome party. 
I know, maybe you could help me? 
Sure, no problem. 
What a pain... 
Searching through all this junk... What a pain... 
...Fine, then. I'll look for it by myself. 
You should've helped her, Mon Frère... 
She looks so sad all by herself... 
Sure, no problem. Right, Iris? 
Yes! Let's do our best, Mon Frère! 
Thank you! I appreciate it. 
Let's help her out, Mon Frère. 
...You're right. I should be moving, not standing around thinking. 
Thank you. I appreciate it. 
We're looking for a kusudama, Ogami. I appreciate your help! 
OK, got it! 
We're looking for a flower vase, Ogami. I appreciate your help! 
OK, got it! 
We're looking for a hanging banner, Ogami. I appreciate your help! 
OK, got it! 
We just looked there, Mon Frère! 
We gotta search properly! 
Did you see it there, Ogami? 
Pull yourself together, Ogami! 
Ah, that's it! Thank goodness we found it. 
What's this? Oh, a kusudama. 
Oh, Ogami! I was looking for a kusudama, too. All that's left is... 
Ah, there you are! That's where you've been hiding. 
A flower vase? That's not it. 
I'm sorry, Ogami. I was actually looking for the vase, too. 
Ah, that's it! Thank goodness we found it. 
A hanging banner? Nope... 
A banner? We'll need that, too. 
I just looked in that box, Mon Frère. 
...Props from "Dinosaur Island"? That takes me back. 
What's this? Machine parts? Doesn't look like it's here. 
I already checked here, Ogami. 
What's this... A poster for "For Love"? That takes me back. 
A Koubu part? Maybe it's inside... Nah, there's no way. 
Maybe it's in the locker... Or not. 
What's this room for? No good... It's locked. 
Not here... Oh, what's this? 
... 
Hey, Mon Frère! What are you doing? 
No slacking off! 
We don't have time, Ogami... Please take this seriously. 
S-Sorry. I got caught up in reading this... 
We've looked so hard, and yet we still can't find what we need... 
We've found a bunch of other stuff, too. Where haven't we looked yet? 
I'll look around a bit more. I'll be fine on my own. 
No, I'm sorry I couldn't be of more help. 
Good luck, Sakura. 
I can't believe we still couldn't find it... 
Seriously... Where could it be? 
I'll look for it a bit more. 
I'm so sorry to have taken up your time. 
No, I'm sorry I couldn't be of more help. 
Good luck, Sakura. 
Iris, Ogami. Thank you very much. You were a great help. 
Nah, it was nothing. 
That was fun, kinda like playing hide-and-seek. 
I'll take these back to the dressing room. If you'll excuse me... 
OK, Iris. We should go, too. 
OK! 
Iris, Ogami. Thank you very much. 
Thanks to you, Ogami, we found everything I was looking for 
You're amazing, Mon Frère! You're a genius at finding things! 
I'll take these back to the dressing room. If you'll excuse me... 
OK, Iris. We should go, too. 
OK! 
Oh, Ogami and Iris. I looked around a bit longer and I managed to find it. 
Really? That's great, Sakura. 
That's great, Sakura! 
I'll take these back to the dressing room. If you'll excuse me... 
OK, Iris. We should go, too. 
OK! 
Sakura, isn't here anymore. I wonder if she went back to her dressing room. 
I'm sure she did. Let's go somewhere else too. 
OK! 
This is the hangar. My Koubu's kept in here, too. 
Nobody would ever guess there's a facility like this below the Imperial Theater. 
Hey, do you know what Orihime's spirit armor is called? 
Orihime's Spirit Armor? I believe it was... 
Eisenkleid. 
Eisenkride. 
Eisencloud. 
Eisenkleid. 
Bingo! You remembered! Just as I expected, Mon Frère! 
I am the captain of the Flower Division, after all. It's only natural. 
Eisenkride. 
Close! It's "Kleid", not "Kride!" 
Was that it? I have a hard time remembering foreign names. 
Eisencloud. 
Close! It's "Kleid", not "Cloud!" 
Was that it? I have a hard time remembering foreign names. 
...Huh? What was it called again? 
Bzzt, time's up! Did you forget, Mon Frère? 
Orihime's spirit armor is called an "Eisenkleid!" 
W-Was that it? I have a hard time remembering foreign names. 
I heard "Eisenkleid" means "Iron dress." 
Orihime's been riding in it ever since she was in the Star Division. 
Iron dress... What an interesting name. 
My Koubu's yellow, just like my battle uniform. 
Your white Koubu matches your uniform too, it's so cool. 
Hahaha, thank you, Iris. 
Oh, Mon Frère, let me see your watch! 
5 minutes to go until it's 12. The welcome party is about to start! 
It's that time already? OK, we need to rush back, then. 
Wow... Amazing! 
It looks like we're all set for the welcome party. 
Hey, you're here. 
We've been waiting for you. 
Ogami, Iris, thank you for your hard work. 
You too, Sakura. Thank you for the getting everything ready. 
Heehee... I like doing this kind of preparation. 
Besides, you all helped me... 
It's all thanks to you. Thank you so much. 
Oh, it was nothing, right Iris? 
Yep! It was a lot of fun being with my Mon Frère! 
Speaking of which, I asked you to bring some plates. 
Yeah, I brought them with us. Sorry we're a little late with them. 
Oh, you didn't forget. I'm glad. 
It's a little late, but you were a big help. Thank you very much. 
Oh, it was nothing, right Iris? 
Yep! It was a lot of fun being with my Mon Frère! 
Speaking of which, I asked you to bring some plates. 
Ah?! Oh, that's right... 
Huh!? You didn't bring them!? 
Sorry... I totally forgot. 
I forgot, too. I'm sorry, Sakura. 
...Oh well. Everyone forgets sometimes. 
I'll go get the plates. Now, everyone please come in. 
Excuse us! 
Oh, everyone, welcome. 
Ogami and Iris asked us to stop by. 
Thank you, Iris and Ogami! 
You told them just like I asked, Ogami. Thank you. 
Oh, it was nothing, right Iris? 
Yep! It was a lot of fun being with my Mon Frère! 
Excuse us! 
Well, now... What beautiful decorations. 
...Oh? What's wrong with Tsubaki? 
Ah?! I forgot to tell Tsubaki! 
Oh, really? Oh, no... 
I forgot, too. I'm sorry, Sakura. 
...OK, I'll go get her later. 
We can all be forgetful sometimes. Don't worry about it. 
...Thank you, Sakura. That's really nice of you to say. I appreciate it. 
Excuse me. Wow, what beautiful decorations! 
...Oh? Where are Kasumi and Yuri? Is something the matter with them? 
Oh! I forgot to tell them! 
Oh, really? Oh, no... 
I forgot, too. I'm sorry, Sakura. 
...OK, I'll go get them later. 
We can all be forgetful sometimes. Don't worry about it. 
...Thank you, Sakura. That's really nice of you to say. I appreciate it. 
It's almost noon... Are Kasumi and the others not coming? 
Ah... That's right, I totally forgot to tell them! 
Huh!? Really?! 
I forgot, too. I'm sorry, Sakura. 
...OK, I'll go get them later. 
We can all be forgetful sometimes... 
But I can't believe you didn't tell any of them. You've got to get your act together, Ogami. 
S-Sorry. I'll be careful from now on 
Well then, all that's left now is to wait for them to show up. 
I know! Why don't we greet them by the entrance? 
That's a great idea. I'm sure our new member will be thrilled. 
Yay! Let's go greet them, let's go! 
Hmhm... So much noise for a simple newcomer. 
I'll be waiting here. I'll leave it to you all to go greet them. 
Understood. OK, let's go. 
Hey, Mon Frère... 
What's up, Iris? 
Let's go to the terrace together to greet them! 
If we shout "welcome" at them from up on the terrace, they'll be so surprised! 
All right, let's go. 
Let's greet them by the entrance. 
...All right, let's go. I'm spending the whole day with you. 
Yay! I get to be with my Mon Frère again! 
You sure like hanging around Japanese men... 
...OK then, the manager and I will wait by the entrance. 
Thanks, I'll leave it to you. 
OK, Mon Frère, let's hurry up and go! 
Let's meet everyone at the door. I'll meet you at the door. 
No! I want to be alone with you! 
Sheesh, what's so great about Japanese men, anyway? 
...Oh well. Iris won't budge once she has her mind set on it. 
Ogami, please go with her. 
The manager and I will greet them by the entrance. 
Really? OK, I'll leave it to you. 
Yay, it's decided! OK, let's go, Mon Frère! 
Hmmm... What should I do? 
C'mon, Mon Frère, let's go together! 
Even if you say no, I'm taking you with me! 
H-Hey, Iris! Don't pull so hard! 
S-Sakura, greet them at the door for me! 
O-OK, understood! 
I'm sorry, Ogami, but each customer is only allowed to purchase one photo at a time. 
I see. That's too bad. 
Sorry, Ogami, but each customer is only allowed to purchase one photo at a time. 
Oh, really? That's too bad.
