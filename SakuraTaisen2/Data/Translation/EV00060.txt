Ahaha… These foes have proven no match for me in the end, of course!
W-Wow… That’s…
…a Star member for you!
…an Eisenkleid for you!
…my command skills for you!
That's a former Star Division member for you!
Precisely! This is the true strength of the Star Division - the best of the best!
That's an Eisenkleid for you!
…Huh? Just which battle were you watching, Mr. Ensign?!
You must be blind if you could not see how strong I truly am!
Hahaha…
Hmm… A swift deployment, graceful changes between offense and defense… That's my command skills for you!
…Quite the simpleton, aren't you, Mr. Ensign?
I-I'm not that bad…
…
Mhmhmm, lost for words there, I see?
…Y-Yeah, I sure am. That was truly amazing. Honestly, I'm stunned…
I'll be counting on you to fight just like that from now on, Orihime!
Well, that is simply too bad. Because this will be my last battle here in Japan!
I-Is that so…?
*sigh* <br> Such trouble you have, comprehending what I say…
