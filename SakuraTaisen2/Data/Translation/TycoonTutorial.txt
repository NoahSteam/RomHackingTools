All right, Ogami,<br>let's go over the rules.<br>I'll keep it simple.
In front of you is your hand.
They are lined up from left to right in order of weakest to strongest.
3 is the weakest, while 2 is the strongest. Remember that.
Next, I'll go over how to play cards.
First, pick whichever card you like and place it in the center.
When you place your first card, you can pick any one you like.
Oh, right! If you have a pair of the same number, you can play both at the same time!
Just line up your cursor over the card you want to play…
Then if you press the A or C Button… Look! The border changed color, see?
And the same goes for playing more than two matching cards, just select them.
See? You selected the second card just now.
If you want to cancel, just press the B Button.
Once you've decided, place your cursor over them again…
Then press either A or C once more to play those cards.
Then your opponent has to play the same amount but with a higher number.
If you have no cards left, you'll have to pass. If everyone passes…
Now you get to play the first card again.
Ah! That's four cards of the same number! That makes a Revolution!
When a Revolution happens, the strength order of all the cards is reversed.
So 2 becomes the weakest and 3 becomes the strongest… It's chaotic!
But if another Revolution happens, the order goes back to normal.
Even if a Revolution occurs, the Joker will always beat any other card.
The Joker is very powerful and can be paired with any other card. Use it wisely.
…Oh, that's right, if you don't want to play, you can pass.
Move your cursor over to PASS and press A or C.
Finally, the game ends once you've gotten rid of all of your cards.
Oh, I almost forgot! In our custom Flower Division rule set…
Playing a 2 or a Joker as your final card is forbidden.
Be careful not to be left with either a Joker or a 2 as your final card.
You're out of cards, Ogami! That means you're the Tycoon! Congrats!
Starting with the first to play all their cards, it goes: Tycoon, Rich, Poor, and Beggar.
In the next round, Poor or Beggar…
…has to give up their strongest non-Joker cards to the Tycoon or the Rich.
In exchange, the Tycoon and Rich can give whatever cards they like to the Poor and Beggar.
The Tycoon and Beggar exchange two cards, while Rich and Poor exchange one.
However, if the Tycoon doesn't get rid of all their cards first in the next round…
They'll fall all the way down to Beggar, so be careful!
Becoming Tycoon gets you 4 points, Rich 2 points, Poor 1 point, and Beggar 0 points.
When a round is over, your points get added up.
Whoever reaches a total of 16 points first is the overall winner!
Well? Do you have a handle on the rules of Tycoon now?
All right then, let's play! Good luck!
Yeah! I'll do my best!
Alright, Ogami,<br>let's go over the rules.<br>I'll keep it simple.
In front of you is your hand.
They are lined up from left to right in order of weakest to strongest.
3 is the weakest, while 2 is the strongest. Remember that.
Next, I'll go over how to play cards.
First, pick whichever card you like and place it in the center.
When you place your first card, you can pick any one you like.
Oh, right! If you have a pair of the same number, you can play both at the same time!
Then your opponent has to play the same amount but with a higher number.
If no cards left or you'd rather not play, you can pass.
Sumire will tell you more about how to pass.
Finally, the game ends once you've gotten rid of all of your cards.
Players are then ranked and awarded points based on the order they finished.
I'll let Kohran tell you more about how that works.
Well, that does it for my explanations. Thanks for listening!
Oh, did you need me for something?
Very well, I'll tell you about how to pass.
Suppose your opponent plays a card, and you have a stronger card…
If you'd like to hold onto it, you can pass.
Whenever you wish to pass, move the cursor away from the cards…
And over the PASS icon, then press A or C.
And look… Now you've passed on your turn, have you not?
If your opponent plays a card stronger than anything in your hand…
You'll pass automatically.
If every other player has passed after you played your card…
You'll get to play whichever card you like, setting the course of the game.
Will you play a strong card and force your opponents to pass?
Or would you rather pass and save those cards for later? Use your judgment, Ensign.
…That concludes my explanation.
I look forward to our duels, Ensign. Good day.
Got it. I'd be more than happy to.
I'll explain the controls for this game.
First, playing the cards. When it's your turn, Captain…
Move the cursor over the card you wish to play.
When you press either the A or C Button, the color of the card will change.
If you wish to play multiple cards of the same number, move the cursor over to each card…
And press A or C on them, one at a time.
If you've changed your mind, you can press the B Button to cancel your selection.
Otherwise, if you wish to play the cards, press A or C again.
The game is won by emptying your hand.
That said, Captain, we do have a house rule around here…
Playing either a 2 or a Joker as your final card is forbidden.
How you choose to play and when…
Therein lies the difference between victory and defeat. Think carefully before making your move.
Exchanging cards works much the same way.
If you wish to learn more about exchanging cards, you can always ask Orihime.
Now you should know everything there is to controlling the game.
Take care, Captain. I'll see you later.
Yo, Boss! Lemme teach ya about how Revolutions work.
Y'see, a Revolution is…<br>Whoa whoa whoa!<br>A Revolution JUST happened!
See how four cards of the same kind were played just now? That's what we call a  Revolution.
When a Revolution happens, the order of how strong the cards are gets instantly reversed!
Though the Joker's always gonna be the strongest card.
Iris knows more about the Joker, so try asking her about it.
Anyway, back to Revolutions. When the strength order of the cards gets reversed…
That means that 2, which used to be the strongest, now becomes the weakest.
And then 3, which used to be the weakest, becomes the strongest!
Just like that, the tables are turned! Pretty cool, right?
Even if you're stuck with low cards, a Revolution isn't off the table!
With Revolutions, you could win in an instant, or lose everything…
But there's still some luck, so don't think about it too hard, OK?
Welp, that's it for my explanation. Got all that?
Alright, see ya later. Lookin' forward to our duel, Boss!
Yoohoo!<br>It's me, Iris! And Jean-Paul's here too!
Eheheh!<br>I'm gonna teach you about something good!
And it's… this!<br>It's the Joker card!
The Joker card is super strong; it beats every card!
Even if a Revolution happens, it'll stay strong, always!
…Oh yeah, ask Kanna for more on Revolutions.
Oh, and I forgot! There's another important Joker trick!
If you've no pair, combine one with the Joker and…
Heehee!<br>Look, that makes a pair!
Got it, Mon Frère? The Joker can turn into any card!
That way it’s easy to play three cards at once!
The Joker is good, but there's only one in the deck.
Think hard about when you'll use it!
See ya, Mon Frère! Let's play soon!
And remember what I taught you!
OK, let's start the show!
I'm gonna teach ya about end-game scores… Oh!
Look at you, Chief!<br>You emptied your hand!
The first player to finish becomes the Tycoon.
Then there's Tycoon, Rich, Poor, Beggar.
Scores are as follows:
Tycoon: 4, Rich: 2, Poor: 1, Beggar: 0.
Scores tally one game at a time…
And whoever reaches 16 points wins overall!
Get 16 points, hit the top, win…
Then it all starts over.
Best way to reach 16? Become a Tycoon, but…
There's a special house rule for Downfalls.
Reni will explain that one.
Alrighty, let's have fun!
Ciao, Mr. Ensign!<br>What do you want to know?
Shall I explain the card exchange?
At the start, the Rich player…
…gets the best card from Poor!
They can't take the Joker from you, relax.
In return, Rich gives any card they don't want to Poor.
Also, the Tycoon takes the top two cards from Beggar!
It’s tough for the poor players, but…
With skill, even a Beggar can win the game!
Well, I’ll never be Beggar…
So I'm not worried about losing my cards! Non ne ho bisogno!
I’d rather take my time…
Pondering if I should take a 3 for a Revolution.
Mr. Ensign, instead of talking…
I want to start playing!<br>Let’s go!
Okay. Here's the Downfall rule.
The tides of war change fast.
Even as Tycoon, Captain…
Never let your guard down in battle.
An advantaged Tycoon has a weakness.
They must empty their hand first in the next game.
If anyone else does it first…
The Tycoon drops to Beggar instantly. This is Downfall.
If Tycoon falls, they’re out immediately.
A Tycoon never knows if they'll drop to Beggar.
And you can use this rule on other Tycoons, too.
The Tycoon position is dangerous.
Remember this rule.
That's all from me. Now, try a real match for experience.
