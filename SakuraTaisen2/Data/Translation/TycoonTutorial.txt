Alright, Ogami, let's go over the rules. I'll keep it simple.
In front of you is your hand.
They are lined up from left to right in order of weakest to strongest.
3 is the weakest card, while 2 is the strongest. Make sure to remember that.
Next, I'll go over how to play cards.
First, pick whichever card you like and place it in the center.
During your turn, you can play whatever card you like.
Oh yeah, if you have a pair of the same number, you can play them both at the same time!
Just line up your cursor over the card you want to play...
Then if you press the A or C button... Look! The border around the cards has changed color, see?
And the same goes for if you want to play more than 2 cards of the same number, just select them with those buttons.
See? You were able to select the second card just now.
If you ever want to cancel your selection of cards, just press the B button.
Once you've decided what cards you want to play, just place your cursor over the cards again...
Then, when you press either A or C one more time, you'll play those cards.
Then your opponent will have to play the same amount of cards but with a higher number.
If you have no cards you can play, you'll have to pass. If everyone else passes...
Now you get to play the first card again.
Ah! That's four cards of the same number! That makes a Revolution!
When a Revolution happens, the strength order of all the cards is reversed.
That means 2 becomes the weakest and 3 becomes the strongest... It's quite chaotic!
If another Revolution happens, though, the strength order will go back to normal.
However, even if a Revolution occurs, the Joker will always beat any other card.
The Joker is a very powerful card, and it can be paired with any other card, too. Use it carefully.
... Oh, that's right, if you simply don't want to play a card, you can willingly pass, too.
Just move your cursor over to the "Pass" icon and press either the A or C button.
And finally, once you run out of cards, you're finished playing.
Oh, I almost forgot! In our custom Flower Division rule set...
Playing a 2 or a Joker as your final card is strictly forbidden.
Be very careful not to be left with either a Joker or a 2 as your final card.
You're out of cards, Ogami! That means you're the Tycoon! Congratulations!
Starting with whoever plays all their cards first, it goes Tycoon, Rich, Poor and Pauper.
In the next round, whoever wound up as Poor or the Pauper...
Has to give up their strongest non-Joker cards to the Tycoon or the Rich.
In exchange, the Tycoon and Rich can give whatever cards they like to the Poor and Pauper.
The Tycoon and Pauper exchange two cards, while Rich and Poor only exchange one card.
However, if the Tycoon doesn't get rid of all their cards first in the next round...
They'll immediately fall all the way down to Pauper, so you better be careful!
Becoming Tycoon gets you 4 points, Rich 2 points, Poor 1 point, and Pauper 0 points.
When a round is over, all your points get added up.
Whichever player reaches a total of 16 points first is the overall winner!
Well? Do you think you have a handle on the rules of Tycoon now?
Alright then, let's play! Good luck!
Yeah! I'll do my best!
