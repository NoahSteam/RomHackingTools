Chief! There's some weird machines set up in here! We gotta stay frosty!
Indeed, we'd best proceed with caution. I don't think even my attacks could reach those things…
Weapons that large must require significant amounts of energy to function…
Which makes those tubes on the ground near them look awful fishy.
Destroying the cannons would be a pain, but if we just need to step on these tubes… Piece of cake!
Yeah, you're right! <br> OK, take out the cannons, along with all the enemies in here!
