Chief! There's some weird machines set up in here! We gotta stay frosty!
Indeed, we'd best proceed with caution. I don't think even my attacks could reach those things…
Weapons that large must require significant amounts of energy to function…
Which makes those tubes on the ground near them look awful fishy.
Destroying the cannons sounds like a pain, but if all we have to do is step on those tubes? Piece of cake!
Yeah, you're right! <br> OK, take out the cannons, along with all the enemies in here!
