Chief! There's some weird machines set up in here! We gotta stay frosty!
Indeed, we'd best proceed with caution. I don't think even my attacks could reach those things…
Weapons that large must require significant amounts of energy to function…
Which makes those tubes on the ground near them look awful fishy.
Smashin' the cannons would be a pain, but those tubes? Piece of cake! Just give 'em a good stomp!
Yeah, you're right! <br> OK, take out the cannons, along with all the enemies in here!
