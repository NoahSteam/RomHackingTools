Captain, why did you put me in the second squadron?
I believe we will battle more efficiently if we act in tandem…
Well, you see…
You're too important to me…
I want you to lead them. 
You're too important to me, Reni.
I couldn't bear to let anything bad happen to you.
You're mistaken, Captain.
I feel safest when you're nearby… You must know that.
Still, thank you for worrying about me.
Reni…
Leave this to me. You've no need for concern.
OK. I'm counting on you, Reni.
I know that if I leave the second squad in your command, I'll have nothing to worry about.
Well… I admit that this may be the optimal way to distribute our forces.
However, your strategic efficiency is weaker than I expected.
We're doomed to fail without more of an effort…
OK, I understand! I'll leave them to you, so don't let me down, Reni.
Roger!
Um, no reason in particular, I guess…
…
I'm sorry, Reni. It seems like I've just made things more uncomfortable…
No, that's not the case at all.
Still, a leader should be able to explain their strategy, even if they must lie.
Yeah, you're right. Sorry…
As you wish, I'll take charge of things here, Captain. You've no need to worry.
Thank you. I'm counting on you, Reni.
