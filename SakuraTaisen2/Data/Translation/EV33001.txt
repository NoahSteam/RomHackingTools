These roaring flames… Simply beautiful. What lucky garbage you are, to be burned by these flames of mine.
Y-You… <br> You're with the Society… Kasha!!
Are… Are you the one who set fire to this town…?
Yes, that's right. <br> Garbage must be burned, after all.
G-Garbage?!
What the hell's wrong with you, hurting all these innocent people?! I'm gonna give ya a piece of my mind!
Heh. Heheheh…
Wh-What's so funny?!
It's just, you know that place you made all those people evacuate to?
Well, I already planted bombs there well in advance!
Heheheh… <br> Now, what do you think will happen when I trigger this detonator?
Y-You coward!
This guy's the worst! <br> Who does he think he is, toying with people's lives like this?!
I'm just burning the trash to keep the capital clean.
You… bastard!
I HATE this guy!
What an utter scoundrel.
…
You… <br> I'm not gonna lose to the likes of you!!
I can't lose, not when I've got people to fight for!
Heheheh… <br> Just how long can you keep up that bravado, I wonder?
…That's far enough!
Mrgh! My detonator…! <br> Who was that?!
Over there!
Looks like I made it just in time.
…Maria? <br> Maria, is that you?!
It's Maria! <br> Maria's here!
Apologies for the delay, Captain. Maria Tachibana, reporting for duty.
With you here, Maria, there's no way we can lose.
Y-You fetid pieces of trash!! You'll pay for this!!
I'll burn you all, <br> burn you to a crisp!!
HAAAHAHAHAHA! <br> You and this miserable town will be reduced to ashes!
