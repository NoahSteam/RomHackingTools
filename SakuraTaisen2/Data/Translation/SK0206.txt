It's locked, so she must be somewhere in the theater. 
She's not here. Where could she have gone? 
Ah, Ogami... Have you found Iris yet? 
No, not yet. 
I see. 
I wonder why she snapped like that. 
I do think Orihime went too far... 
But it's not often you see Iris lose her temper that badly. 
She was in a good mood earlier today, too... 
Maybe she just happened to be in a bad mood. 
She was in a good mood earlier today, too... 
Maybe she just happened to be in a bad mood. 
Come to think of it, after the battle... 
She seemed to be in a good mood earlier when we were getting ready for the party. 
Yes. I wonder, what on earth could be the reason for it? 
Well, there's no point wondering about it until we can have a talk with her. 
Right. In that case, I'll try searching a bit more. 
Who knows? Maybe she just happened to be in a bad mood. 
Maybe so, but I feel like there must be some reason for it. 
Well, there's no point wondering about it until we can have a talk with her. 
Right. In that case, I'll try searching a bit more. 
Hang on... Come to think of it, after the battle... 
...Iris seemed kind of down. 
Oh... Now I remember! She went back ahead of the rest of us. 
When she caught sight of one of the families we rescued, she suddenly got quiet. 
Maybe that has something to do with what just happened here. 
I'm impressed you noticed a tiny detail like that, Ogami. I wouldn't expect any less from you. 
No, it's nothing more than a guess right now. 
Well, there's no point wondering about it until we can have a talk with her. 
Right! In that case, I'll try searching a bit more. 
What could've gotten Iris so upset...? I'm not sure, myself. 
Still, there's no point wondering about it until we can have a talk with her. 
...Yes, that's true. 
In that case, I'll try searching a bit more. I'll see you later. 
Looks like Iris isn't here... 
I guess Tsubaki already went home for the day. 
If she were still here, I could've gotten her help with the search... 
It's just like Tsubaki to keep everything tidied up like this. 
...Er, I guess now's not the time to stand around here being impressed. I better look for Iris. 
The dining hall is so lonely when no one's here eating. 
Iris isn't here, either. I'll try looking in another room. 
Not in here... Well, if she were here, we'd have found her already. 
Earlier, she and I were in here to look for some plates to use at the party... 
I wouldn't have thought I'd be back here later looking for her, instead. 
I wonder if Iris is hiding somewhere out of sight... 
Shoot, she's not here. Guess I better go check a different room. 
The door's locked tight. I doubt she'd have been able to get outside from here. 
Which means... She must still be inside the theater somewhere. 
The door's locked. No one's left the building since I was here last. 
That means Iris is somewhere inside the theater. 
Looks like Kasumi and Yuri already went home for the day. 
If Yuri were around, I bet I could ask her where to find Iris. 
Iris isn't here. I'll go check a different room. 
Mr. Yoneda... Wonder if he's still up. 
Though I doubt he knows anything about where Iris could be... 
I should get a move on and keep looking for her. 
Mr. Yoneda, do you have a moment? 
Snooooore, snooooore... 
Ah, sounds like he's asleep. 
Oh well. I'll check somewhere else. 
Mr. Yoneda, are you in? It's Ogami. 
Oh, Ogami. Come on in, it's not locked. 
Right. Pardon me. 
How about it, boy? Want a drink? 
I-I appreciate the offer, sir, but I'm in something of a hurry right now... 
Ehn? You're talking about Iris, I bet? 
Wait, how did you know that? 
Even the thickest of blockheads couldn't have missed all the commotion she made. 
I'm so sorry I let things get this far. 
She was in a good mood earlier today, so I can't imagine why this happened... 
Ogami, just because someone's outwardly cheerful doesn't always mean they feel the same way on the inside. 
Consider this. Why did she act so pleasant during the day? 
Why did she suddenly seem depressed when she saw that family after the battle... 
...and how are you going to handle this going forward? Think it all over carefully. 
Right... 
Now, I've said my piece, so you need to get a move on and go look for Iris. 
I'm sure wherever she is, she's waiting for you to come find her. 
Yes, sir. 
Think it over carefully, huh? Hmm... 
Iris isn't here. I thought for sure she would be. 
Guess I'll go somewhere else. 
No one here. Maybe I'll try another room. 
(Wait, isn't that Orihime?) 
(She's coming out of the costume room. What was she doing in there?) 
... 
Speak to Orihime. 
Watch her quietly. 
Speak to Orihime. 
Watch her quietly. 
Cover her eyes and ask "Guess who?" 
Hey, Orihime. 
Kyah! 
Oh, so it's you, Ensign. I ask you do not startle me like that. 
Orihime, what are you doing here? 
... 
(Huh, now she's peeking inside the backstage room.) 
(She's been going around, looking in different rooms for a while now.) 
...Who's there?! 
(Oh crap, she found me!!) 
E-Ensign?! 
How disgusting you are! Sneaking around and spying on people! 
You have not a single ounce of regret for peeking into the bath, do you, you human refuse! 
I-I'm sorry. That wasn't my intention... 
In any case, just what were you doing around here, Orihime? 
... 
(I know. Why don't I tease her a little?) 
Guess whooo? 
Kyaahhh!! 
E-Ensign! What do you think you are doing, jumping out of nowhere?! 
Do not be touching me with your grimy little hands! 
I didn't mean... It was just a joke... 
There is quite a difference between the good jokes and the bad! 
Japanese men are truly ignorant, uncultured, shameless swine! 
Ooh, I cannot stand to see your face any more! I am excusing myself! 
Ah... She's gone. Maybe I went a bit too far? 
In any case, just what in the world was she doing over here? 
(I'll try watching her quietly.) 
(Anyway, searching for Iris should come first.) 
Were you looking for Iris? 
Helping with the nighttime patrol? 
Were you, by any chance, looking for Iris? 
...N-Not at all. 
OK then, what were you doing? 
...Whatever I was doing is no business of yours, Ensign! 
Why do you not save your breath, and go search for Iris yourself? 
You're right. If I have time to be standing around chatting like this, I should be off looking for her. 
Still though, just what were you doing, Orihime? 
Were you, by any chance, helping with the nighttime patrol? 
I am not so cruel as to take your precious chores away from you, Ensign. 
If I did it in place of you, you really would be useless. 
U-Useless? 
If you have the time to stand around and shoot breezes with me, would it not be better to go look for Iris? 
I will be going now, if you please. 
You're right. If I have time to be standing around chatting like this, I should be off looking for her. 
Still though, just what were you doing, Orihime? 
I think whatever I was doing has nothing to do with you. 
And now I will be going, so do pardon me. 
I do wonder what she was up to... 
Iris, if you're in here, please come out and talk to me. 
... 
No response. I suppose she isn't in here, then. 
No one's in here, and nothing has changed since the last time I was here. 
Guess I'll go check a different room. 
No Iris here. Hmm, where could she have gotten to? 
Well, I've got to keep searching. I'll try going somewhere else. 
Yeah, doesn't look like she's in here. I'll try another room. 
Iris was so cheerful earlier today. I wonder what happened? 
Doesn't seem like she's in here, either... Time to try somewhere else. 
I've already tried looking here. I'd better go somewhere else. 
This is where I had that strange encounter with Saki when she cornered me earlier. 
And on top of that, Kayama turned up in here, too... 
What was Kayama doing at the theater, anyway? 
She's not here behind the stage, it looks like. 
And I don't see anyone when I look out at the audience seating from here, either. 
Guess she isn't here. Time to search another room. 
Iris! Come on out! 
Iris!! 
... 
No good. I guess she isn't here. 
I can't find her anywhere. Just where did she go? 
Maybe she could be hiding in the shade of this tree? 
...She's not here. 
And... not over here, either. 
I've searched the courtyard pretty thoroughly, so she must not be here. 
Maybe I'll try looking one more time. 
... 
... 
Yeah, she's not here. I guess she didn't go to the courtyard. 
(Oh, it's Reni. It looks like he doesn't realize I'm here.) 
(He went downstairs. What's he going to do in the basement?) 
It's already 11 o'clock. I wonder where Iris could've gone. 
Wait. Kayama said something earlier... 
I think it was... "try going to the attic." 
Well, what have I got to lose? Guess I'll try the attic. 
(Hmm? Reni?) 
(What could he be doing here?) 
Say something. 
Leave. 
Cover his eyes and ask "Guess who?" 
Hey, Reni. What're you doing - 
...! 
Uwaaahhhh!! 
Yeowch... 
...Captain? 
R-Reni... 
There's no need... to send me flying... 
...You should not approach me from behind. 
My body moved on its own, which is why I threw you aside. 
I... I see... 
Goodbye, then. 
Ah, Reni! 
...There he goes. 
Still, I can't believe he tossed me aside like a piece of paper. 
Where the heck did he learn a move like that? 
(He looks lost in thought.) 
(I should leave him alone. Besides, I need to look for Iris right now.) 
(I know. I'll try teasing him a little.) 
Guess... 
...! 
...Whooooo?!! 
Yeowch... 
...Captain? 
R-Reni... 
There's no need... to send me flying... 
...You should not approach me from behind. 
My body moved on its own, which is why I threw you aside. 
I... I see... 
Goodbye, then. 
Still, I can't believe he tossed me aside like a piece of paper. 
Where the heck did he learn a move like that? 
... 
Who is it? 
Um, sorry... It's me, Reni. 
... 
Did you... need something? 
Well, I'm searching for Iris, and I was wondering if you've happened to have seen her? 
...I don't know. 
Goodbye, then. 
Reni, wait! 
And he's already gone... Oh well. I should get going, too. 
Iris doesn't seem to be here, either. 
Hmm, where could she have gone... 
There's no one here. Guess I should check someplace else. 
There's no way she'd hide in a place with such a great view. 
Iris... Where in the world could you have gone? 
Yeah, she's not here. She doesn't seem to be on the terrace, either. 
Hmm... Where's another place she could have gone... 
Iris! Iris, are you here? 
...No response. I looked over all the seats, but it doesn't seem like she's here. 
She's definitely not here. I even looked in between all the seats. 
It doesn't look like she's anywhere in the first floor seating, either. 
I'll tidy up the flower vases and chairs. 
Ogami, please see to Iris. 
Got it. I'll leave this place to you. 
The flower vases and chairs have been neatly put away. It must be thanks to Sakura's hard work. 
It doesn't look like Iris came back here. Maybe I should try searching a different room. 
I thought she may have returned, but I guess I was off the mark. 
Iris... Where in the world did she go? 
She went rushing out of the salon, so it seems pretty unlikely that she'd be in here. 
It'd be nice if I had some idea of whether she was on the first or second floor, though... 
Yeah, she isn't here. I'll try looking in another room. 
Phew... Maybe I'll head back to my room for a minute and take a breather. 
All right... What should I do from here? 
Make a call. 
Go search for Iris. 
Maybe calling someone would be a nice change of pace. 
OK, I've powered on the Cinematron, so... I wonder who I should call? 
OK. I'll try calling someone. 
Hmm... I getcha. 
Essentially, I... 
But ya see... 
Hey, that sounds like Sumire. 
Whoa, Chief? I'm gabbin' a bit with Sumire right now. 
Perfect timing. How's about the three of us chat? 
Kohran's not picking up. Maybe she isn't near the Cinematron. 
Essentially, I... 
But ya see... 
Hey, is that Kohran? 
Oh my... Ensign, is that you? 
How lovely. Why not join in our little discussion? 
Yes, hello? 
Hey, Sumire. It's Ogami. 
Oh my, Ensign?! Allow me to switch over my screen. Would you wait just one moment? 
Now then, was there something you needed? 
Yes, hello? 
Oh, Sumire! So this was your number, then? 
Ah, Ensign?! Then you can hear me. How lovely. 
Could you wait for just one moment? I will switch over my screen. 
Now then, was there something you needed? 
Yeah, I wanted to talk a bit. 
I wanted to wish you goodnight. 
It's a prank call. 
Yeah, I wanted to talk for a bit, if that's OK... 
I do hope you'll forgive me Ensign, but I must change and be away to bed soon. 
The hour grows quite late, after all. Could our conversation perhaps wait until tomorrow? 
I see... Sorry. 
Well then, Ensign, I bid you goodnight. 
Yeah, I guess calling people so late at night was probably a bad idea. 
Well, I just wanted to wish you goodnight. 
Goodness, Ensign, you went to all that trouble to call me for such a thing? 
Even so, I am rather touched by your consideration for me. Thank you very much. 
Well then, Ensign, I bid you goodnight. 
Yeah, good night. 
Sumire... 
Well... It's a prank call. 
Ohohoho. But when speaking via the Cinematron, you can see the other person's face. 
Thus revealing the identity of the prank caller, and rendering it rather moot. 
Oh, good point. You're absolutely right. 
Now then, I must get changed and be off to bed. 
Good evening to you, Ensign. 
Hmm... Seems like it'll be pretty tough to prank someone with the Cinematron. 
...Ensign, do say something, if you would. 
It is somewhat rude to call someone and then stay silent, don't you think? 
Oh... Sorry, sorry. 
If there is nothing you need, I must be off to bed. Do pardon me. 
Ahh, shoot. I bungled that one. 
...Sumire's not answering. Maybe she's already in bed. 
Kohran and I were just discussing the Flower Division. 
You guys had a dustup with the Black Demon Society today over in Uguisudani, am I right? 
So how'd it go, anyways? 
It was a surprisingly easy win. 
It was a pretty tough fight. 
They managed to "mech" a mess of things... 
It was a surprisingly easy win. Our newest member, Reni, really pulled his weight out there. 
Wowee, he sure does sound promising! I was getting a bit worried about you all, but hearing that makes me feel better. 
Still... How disappointing to hear that victory came so easily even without us. 
Ah, don't get all down in the dumps, Sumire. The important thing is that they won, not how they did it. 
It was a pretty tough fight. I'm sure if you two had been here, we would've had an easier time of it. 
I would imagine so. Without me there, the Flower Division cannot display its true power, after all. 
Hoo-wee... Just as full of can-do as ever, eh Sumire? 
Still, if it's enough to make the Chief worry... 
...then it sounds like these guys are nothing to sneeze at. 
They really managed to "mech" a mess of things. 
Ahahaha! Aw Chief, you're such a hoot! 
Look at you makin' puns... How do you come up with this stuff? 
You got my joke, huh? Thanks, Kohran. 
...Really, now. You know, they do say that puns are the lowest form of joke. 
I do wish you had more of a highbrow sense of humor. 
R-Right... 
Well, we've only fought them once so far, so I can't exactly say for sure. 
Yup, I do suppose that's true. 
Anywho, it's gonna be a bit longer before Sumire and me come on back to the theater... 
...so you take good care of things until then, Chief. 
Ensign, I trust that you will eagerly await my return. 
Yeah, of course. 
Now then, I must take my leave. Ensign, Kohran, I bid you good evening. 
Alrighty. See ya later, then! 
I've still got some work to finish up, so I'm gonna duck out and burn the midnight oil a bit longer. 
I see. Keep up the good work, Kohran. 
Thanks much! Have a good night. 
The Black Demon Society... We definitely need to watch out for them. 
Now then, should I call someone else? 
Kanna's not picking up. Maybe she's not around? 
Uhm... Hello? 
Oh, Kanna! 
Boss?! What the... 
Uhm... Hello? 
Kanna?! Oh, so this was your number, then? 
Boss?! What the... 
Yaaawn... 
Were you asleep, Kanna? Sorry. 
Yeah... I hit the sack early today. 
Hang up. 
Apologize, then hang up. 
I guess it is getting pretty late, huh? I'll hang up. 
Hey, man. What the heck did ya want from me? 
Ah, whatever. I'm beat. Night, Boss. 
Sorry, I wanted to talk to you, so I gave you a call. 
I guess it is pretty late, so I'll let you go. 
I see... Well, thanks for takin' the time to call me. 
But I'm dead tired, so why don't we talk tomorrow instead? 
Yeah, sure thing. 
Yaaawn... Well, g'night, Boss. 
So, Boss... Did ya need me for somethin'? 
Well, uh... Nothing in particular. I just wanted to talk to you. 
C'mon Boss, gimme a break. You got any idea what time it is? 
How 'bout we talk tomorrow? I'm... about to pass out, here... 
S-Sure. It is getting late, so let's do that. 
Yaaawn... Well, g'night, Boss. 
Man, she was asleep and everything. I wish I hadn't done that. 
It's that late already... What now? 
...She's not picking up. She must be asleep by now. 
Oh, Captain. Good morning. 
Hey, Maria. 
Thank you for taking the time to call me all the way here in New York. 
Why don't we talk for a few minutes, then? 
Oh, Captain. Good morning. 
Maria?! Oh, so this was your number, then? 
Yes, that's right. So you went to the trouble of looking it up? 
Why don't we talk for a few minutes, then? 
You know, isn't it kind of strange to say "good morning" at this hour? 
Haha... There's a 10-hour time difference between the capital and New York. 
It may be nighttime over there, but it's morning in New York. 
Oh, I see... 
... 
Was there something you needed, Captain? 
You seem to have a rather bleak expression on your face... 
Talk about Iris. 
Talk about Orihime. 
Actually... Iris got all worked up and made a mess of the salon. 
Then she ran off to hide somewhere. I'm searching for her now. 
...Wait, what? 
She was so bubbly when I spoke with her this afternoon. So why... 
Well, I'm not too sure, either. 
If that's the case, why are you calling me like there's nothing else going on right now?! 
Um... I wanted to ask you for advice, Maria... 
Get it together, Captain. Iris is waiting for you to go and support her. 
Think long and hard about why she was clinging to you earlier today. 
... 
You need to go find her right now. Hurry it up! 
R-Right. 
Man, she really let me have it. 
We had a new member named Orihime join the Flower Division recently. 
She hardly listens to a thing I say. I'm not sure how to handle her. 
I haven't met this Orihime myself, so I can't say anything for certain. However... 
If you can make it clear to her that you're a captain who cares for his subordinates, I'm certain she'll come around. 
Have confidence in yourself, Captain. I have faith that you can do this. 
All right. I'll give it some more time. 
Well, I must be going. 
It may be morning here, but have a good night, Captain. 
I know what she said, but something tells me it won't be that easy. 
No... Nothing in particular. 
Really? Are you taking care not to do anything that would cause me undue worry? 
Yes, we're fine here. Don't worry about a thing, Maria. Just focus on doing your best in New York. 
I see. All right, then. 
Well, I must be going. 
It may be morning here, but have a good night, Captain. 
Maria... I certainly don't want to make her worry about us. 
I'll figure things out with Iris, for sure. 
...Hello? 
Maria? It's Ogami. 
Captain! Why aren't you looking for Iris?! 
Get off the line with me and go find her, right now! 
O-OK, I get it. 
I guess I ought to do as she says and keep looking... 
...Maria's not picking up. 
Guess I'll have to give up on it for now. 
Maria's not picking up. 
It's morning where she is now. She probably went to eat breakfast or something. 
Good evening. It's time for Capital News. 
Hex Mechs appeared shortly after noon today among a crowd of vacationers in Uguisudani. 
They engaged in combat with the Imperial Assault Troupe, who were dispatched to the scene. 
At the time of the incident, a number of sightseers who had come to view the wisterias were present at the scene. 
Now, we'll hear comments from some people who witnessed the Hex Mechs. 
Yeah, I was just laying back, taking in the flowers and enjoying some sake when those things showed up out of nowhere. 
Sheesh, it completely killed my buzz. How're they planning to make up for this, huh? 
...You can hear the anger in his voice. 
Thanks to the efforts of the Imperial Assault Troupe... 
...the incident was put to rest without any casualties. 
The unusual Spirit Armor sighted during last month's battle in Ginza... 
...appears of a similar type to the one which showed up in Uguisudani. 
The Ministry of Communications recently instated regular airmail service for the capital, Osaka, and Fukuoka regions. 
Hopes are high that this will enable faster delivery of mail over long distances... 
But, due to high costs, it will likely be utilized primarily by government agencies and businesses. 
It may take some time for this next-generation airmail service to be useful to the general public. 
Finally, it's time for this week's weather forecast. 
A high-pressure system will advance over the Sea of Japan this week, leading to more clear early summer skies. 
However, there is speculation that turnouts of vacationers to resorts will be reduced... 
...in no small part due to the incident with today's Hex Mech attack. 
That's it for Capital News, brought to you by the Capital Daily Report. 
That concludes today's broadcast. We hope you will look forward to tomorrow's programming. 
A red shadow opposes the evildoers lurking in the darkness of the capital. His name is Masked Red! 
Masked Red, the boy wonder of justice! Today he continues his fight for peace in the capital! 
Serial Radio Drama Masked Red, The Terrifying Mummy, Part 1 
On a hot summer's eve, a girl walks briskly down a gloomy, barren street. 
Oh no. I'm going to be late for my koto lesson..." 
She turns down a narrow alleyway, only to find a figure standing there. 
Suddenly a huge man looms over her, standing at least 2 meters tall. 
What's more, for reasons unknown he's wrapped head to toe in pale brown bandages. 
The mystery figure's eye seems to glint red, and a massive hand reaches down for the girl! 
Eeeek! Someone, help me!" she screams. Then, at that very moment... 
Stop right there!" calls a voice from atop a blazing red steam bike! 
Oh, it's Masked Red!" <br> "No need to worry, Miss, I'm here to help!" 
Masked Red leaps from his bike, looking dashing as his cape billows in the wind. 
Will our hero be able to rescue this damsel in distress? 
Fight on, Masked Red! You're our hero, Masked Red! <br> The End 
Go, Masked Red! Fight on, Masked Red! Tune in next time! 
This isn't the time to be making calls. 
I need to look for Iris. 
Iris... Where could she have gone? 
...Ogami. 
Hm? Am I getting a call? 
No, Ogami. I'm right here, behind you. 
S-Saki? What is it? 
Well you see, I wanted to speak to you alone. 
But perhaps not here... Could you please follow me? 
Shoot, it's already this late?! 
I don't have time to be doing this. I have to look for Iris! 
If I recall, Kayama said to try going to the attic. 
Well, what have I got to lose? Guess I'll try the attic. 
This isn't the time to be loafing around. 
Right now as I'm standing here, Iris is all by herself, feeling lonely. 
OK, let's go. Wait for me, Iris. I'm on my way now. 
Just where could Iris have gone? 
Ayame... What should I do at a time like this? 
Just where could Iris have gone? 
... 
...You're pathetic, Ogami. You're the captain, so you'd better act like it! 
Ayame would scold me for behaving this way. 
The library... Iris doesn't usually come in here. 
It's going to be a pain, but I guess I have no choice but to go room by room and check for her. 
Just as I thought, it doesn't look like she's come here. I'll try searching another room. 
I wonder if Reni is in here... 
Reni's nameplate. It's just his name written on a piece of paper. 
Such a bland, spartan nameplate. It's very much Reni's style, I guess. 
...No time to be loitering around. I need to find Iris. 
Looks like Reni isn't here. 
Who's there? 
It's Ogami. Mind if I come in? 
...Go ahead. 
Thanks. Sorry to intrude. 
Wow, this is one bleak-looking room. 
... 
Uh, sorry. I didn't mean any offense. 
It's fine... 
In any case, did you need me? 
Have you seen Iris? 
Tell me about yourself, Reni. 
Have you seen Iris? She ran off, and we can't find her anywhere. 
...That has nothing to do with me. 
What do you mean, "nothing to do with you"? Iris is your teammate, isn't she? 
Aren't you worried about her? 
We are nothing more than combatants. 
Emotions are unneeded in battle. On the battlefield, excessive emotion can lead one to make mistakes. 
Reni... 
That isn't true! 
You have a point... 
Reni, that isn't true! 
To the Flower Division, there's nothing more important than our comrades' feelings. 
There is no such thing as "excessive emotion"! 
...How can you make sound decisions when you're that worked up? 
Uh... 
Well, there's somewhere I must go. 
You have a point. Excessive emotion can be deadly on the battlefield. 
Just as I'd expect from you, Reni. I'm impressed. 
...I also believe it is necessary to take a cautious attitude and question things. 
Uh... 
Well, there's somewhere I must go. 
If you have no need of me, there's somewhere I must go. 
Since I'm here, why not tell me about yourself, Reni? 
...About myself? 
Tell me about Germany, or your childhood, anything like that. 
...I don't know. 
Huh?! 
I don't know, so I have nothing to tell you. 
If you don't need anything else, there's somewhere I must go. 
H-Hey Reni, wait a second! 
...Gone already. He's a quick one, that's for sure. 
But still, I wonder what he meant by "I don't know." 
If you have no need of me, there's somewhere I must go. 
H-Hey Reni, wait a second! 
...Gone already. He's a quick one, that's for sure. 
Reni and Iris both... I wonder where they went. 
...! 
Oh, Sakura! 
Are you... angry about what happened earlier? 
No, not really. 
Well, excuse me. 
Uh... 
Explain what happened. 
Force her to stop. 
Explain what happened. 
Sakura, you don't have to open the door, but please, just listen to me. 
Saki and I were in the prop room together because she was asking me for advice. 
I can't exactly tell you what we talked about, but there was nothing untoward about it. 
Then Saki slipped and fell, and I had to help her get back up. 
Nothing else happened. You've got to believe me on that. 
...I see. Ogami, you are a pretty serious person. 
Is that really true? You tend to be pretty insincere around other people, Ogami. 
H-Hey, wait... 
...I'm sorry. I really do believe you. 
You're not the sort of person to lie about anything. 
But... I don't think I can face you with an honest smile. 
Sakura... 
So, I can't open the door. I'm sorry, Ogami. 
But by tomorrow, I'm sure I'll be able to greet you with a smile again. 
...OK. 
Well, I'll be going. See you in the morning, Sakura. 
Yes. Sorry, Ogami. 
Sakura, just listen to me! 
Ogami! What do you think you're doing, grabbing my sleeve like that?! 
I want to tell you what really happened. 
Saki and I were in the prop room together because she was asking me for advice. 
I can't exactly tell you what we talked about, but there was nothing untoward about it. 
Then Saki slipped and fell, and I had to help her get back up. 
Nothing else happened. You've got to believe me on that. 
... 
...Thank you. I really do believe you, Ogami. 
But... I don't think I can face you with an honest smile. 
Sakura... 
So... please excuse me for today. 
By tomorrow, I'm sure I'll be able to show you a smile again. 
...OK. 
Then, I'll be going. See you... in the morning. 
...Yes. 
(I should probably leave her be for now...) 
Sakura, I'll be going. 
But let's talk again in the morning. 
... 
Goodbye, then. 
Sakura is in her room, but... I should leave her alone right now. 
I wonder if Sakura is there? 
Sakura's nameplate. It has a very girlish design. 
...No response. I guess she's not in. 
I guess she must be out looking for Iris, too. 
Guess I'll try a different room. 
Kanna's room is locked, so I can't go inside. 
I wonder, what would Kanna do if she were here? 
The door is locked. There's no way Iris could get in. 
Orihime... Is she in her room? 
Orihime's nameplate. It's simple, but sophisticated. 
Guess I'll try a different room. 
I guess Orihime isn't here. 
(I did speak with Orihime earlier. And besides, finding Iris takes priority.) 
Yes, who is it? 
It's Ogami. Do you have a minute, Orihime? 
...Could that be you, Ensign? 
I do not have a word of anything to say to you. 
It is time for me to sleep, so be off with you now, quickly! 
H-Hey, Orihime! 
... 
Orihime?! 
Man, turned away at the door... I give up. 
Oh well. I'll go try another room. 
How rude you are, to be showing up at this hour of the night! 
What in this world could you want from me? 
Did you perhaps come here to talk about what happened with Iris? 
... 
Ask how she's doing. 
Give her a warning. 
Orihime, is something the matter? Earlier, you got so angry all of a sudden. 
...There is nothing, particularly. 
It sure seemed like there was something, if you ask me. 
You call me out here, and only for this, Ensign?! 
Having this discussion with you is only a waste of my time. I will be excusing myself. 
Shoot... No good. 
Oh well. I should get back to searching for Iris. 
Orihime, I don't know why you suddenly got so upset. 
But you took things too far with the way you acted towards Iris today. 
All of us are members of the Flower Division. So... 
Ohh yes, I did think you would be saying something like that. 
All the time, I am getting better at knowing what you will be thinking. 
O-Orihime... 
I cannot just be playing make-believe like we are friends. 
And now I will be excusing myself. Good night! 
Hmm... I wonder if she understood what I was trying to say. 
Oh well. Right now, looking for Iris is more important. 
... 
What is it? You call me out here, only to stand here like this. How angry you make me! 
How rude for you to treat someone this way, when they come out of their way to speak to you. 
Go ahead and stand there forever then, with your mouth sealed shut! 
Shoot... No good. 
Oh well. I should go somewhere else and keep looking for Iris. 
If Maria were here right now, she would... 
No. This isn't the time to be weak-hearted. 
Somehow or another, I have to lend Iris my strength. 
The door is locked. There's no way Iris could get in. 
...The door's open. Maybe she's inside? 
Nope, she's not in here. 
I thought she might've closed herself away in her room, but it looks like I was wrong. 
OK, time to try looking somewhere else. 
Maybe she's come back to her room by now? 
Nope, she's not here. 
Oh well. Time to go try another room. 
I bet if Kohran were here, she'd have some handy little person-locator robot she could whip out. 
But I guess there's no point thinking about stuff like that. I should get going. 
The door is locked. There's no way Iris could get in. 
I don't think she'll be in Sumire's room. It's locked, after all. 
OK, time to go search a different room. 
The door is locked. There's no way Iris could get in. 
Iris isn't here. I thought she might be, but... 
Oh well. I'll go somewhere else for now. 
(Ah, there's Iris!) 
... 
Iris, if you stay here too long, you're going to catch cold. 
Oh, Mon Frère... 
You... You came looking for me? 
Of course. I just had a feeling I might find you here. 
Mon Frère, thank you... 
(Ah, there's Iris!) 
... 
Iris, if you stay here too long, you're going to catch cold. 
Oh, Mon Frère... 
You... You came looking for me? 
Yeah. Sorry it took me some time to come. 
It's OK... I'm happy you came to get me. 
...I'm sorry, Mon Frère. 
We went to all that trouble for Reni's party, and then I messed it up. 
It's OK, Iris. I'm sure Reni wasn't bothered by it. 
Orihime may have said some nasty things... 
...but I don't think she meant anything by it. You should try and forgive her. 
...OK. 
I think maybe... I got a little bit too angry. 
I see. 
It's getting pretty late. Come on, let's get you back to your room. 
...OK. 
Oh yeah, I have to write back to papa and mama. 
Wait, you're going to write them now? But it's already time for bed. 
...No, I want to write it today. 
Ooh! Mon Frère, why don't you write them a letter, too! 
Hang on a sec! I can't exactly write in French! 
That's OK! You just tell me what you wanna say. 
And then I'll write it down for you. 
I'm gonna go get changed, and then I'll come to your room! I'll be right there, so please wait for me! 
H-Hey, Iris! 
Oh boy. She rushed off looking completely thrilled. 
I guess there's no helping it. I may as well spend the rest of the evening with Iris. 
OK, I'd better start cleaning off my desk. 
It's Iris. Can I come in? 
Yeah, go ahead. It's not locked. 
Okaaay! Coming in now! 
Hee hee. Thanks for waiting, Mon Frère. 
It's already 11 o'clock. I wonder where Iris could've gone. 
Wait. Kayama said something earlier... 
I think it was... "try going to the attic." 
Well, what have I got to lose? Guess I'll try the attic. 
I'm not sure if Iris would come to a place like this, but it wouldn't hurt to check. 
Yeah, she isn't here. I'll try a different room. 
If another enemy appeared right now, it would be pretty bad. I need to find her, fast. 
Where could Iris be, I wonder, and why did she get so agitated all of a sudden? 
There's only a few of these processing machines in Japan but I doubt even a machine this advanced could help me now. 
If only I could think as clearly as a machine to find a solution... 
No, that's no good. People can get stronger precisely because we struggle. 
And right now, what I need to do is lend Iris my strength. 
She's not here, either. 
Just to be certain, I'll try checking all the way in the back of the intensive care room. 
This room is ordinarily off-limits. It seems pretty suspicious... 
... 
Nope. She's not in here, after all. 
Yeah, definitely not in here. And it seems there's no sign of anyone else having entered this room, either. 
Oh well. I'll go try another room. 
Hm? Is someone taking a bath? 
Maybe it's Iris... 
Huh? Those flashy clothes, aren't these Orihime's?! 
S-So then... Orihime is in there r-right now. 
My body is moving towards the bathroom on its own... 
Go back outside. 
Oh no, my body is moving towards the bathroom on its own... 
Ahhh. I'm surprised; Japanese bathrooms aren't all that bad. 
(Orihime is... in the b-bath.) 
...! Is someone there?! 
(Crap, did she see me?!) 
Make an excuse. 
Run away. 
Make an excuse. 
H-Hey, Orihime. 
E-Ensign?! 
Um, y-you see, there's a reason I'm here. 
Do not feed me your excuses! Have a taste of this bucket!! 
Yeeeowch! 
I'm leaving right now! Please don't throw another bucket at me! Uwahhh, help!! 
Mamma mia, coming into the bathroom when someone is bathing... Are you all right in the head, Ensign? 
I'm sorry... 
Ohh, and I had just washed away all my feelings of irritation. Now I'm even angrier than before!! 
From now on, I will make sure to lock you in your room before I enter the bath. 
Oh yes. Maybe even to be safe, I will tie some rope around you as well! 
H-Hey, wait... 
Anyway, the next time you peek, you will wish I was using a bath bucket. 
Sheesh... I know I brought it on myself, but that was awful. 
(I gotta get out of here before she sees me!) 
Phew... I think I got away before she realized I was there. 
If I'd been just a moment slower, I might not have made it. That was too close... 
Wh-Who's there? Ensign, it couldn't be you, could it?! 
O-Orihime... Um, I... 
Just get yourself out of here, right away! 
Uh, s-sorry. I'm leaving right now. 
Mamma mia, coming into the bathroom when someone is bathing... Are you all right in the head, Ensign? 
I-I'm sorry, I wasn't trying to peek in on you... 
When I realized someone was in there, I just panicked and froze up. 
It is easy enough to see from here if someone is in the bath. 
Ohh, and I had just washed away all my feelings of irritation. Now I'm even angrier than before!! 
From now on, I will make sure to lock you in your room before I enter the bath. 
Oh yes. Maybe even to be safe, I will tie some rope around you as well! 
H-Hey, wait... 
Anyway, do not expect to be let off so easy the next time you peek. 
Sheesh... I know I brought it on myself, but that was awful. 
(I'd better get out of here before Orihime sees me.) 
...Looks like I got out without her realizing. 
If Orihime ever found me here like this, she'd never forgive me for it. 
I should get going. It doesn't look like Iris is in here, anyway. 
Ahh... I think it's about time I got out. 
(Oh crap!! It looks like she's getting out of the water!) 
(I gotta get out of here before she sees me!) 
Phew... I think I got away before she realized I was there. 
If I'd been just a moment slower, I might not have made it. That was too close... 
Ah, Ensign. 
H-Hey, Orihime. Were you taking a bath? 
Why, yes. I just got out. 
You would not happen to have been peeking inside, were you? 
When I was in the bath, I had a sense that someone was close by. 
N-No... Must've been your imagination. 
How very strange. I would have sworn that someone was in there. 
So, what do you think of Japanese baths? 
It wasn't as bad as I thought it would be, even if the picture of Mt. Fuji on the wall is nothing in the way of style. 
But my feelings of irritation have all washed away. I feel very refreshed. 
I will be going now, if you please. 
(Thank goodness, looks like she didn't notice anything.) 
OK, I should get back to searching for Iris. 
Looks like there's no one here. 
The bathroom seems to be totally empty. I should check somewhere else. 
Orihime was in here just a little while ago. It smells nice. 
...No, now's not the time for that. I need to keep looking for Iris. 
This soap smells really nice. I wonder who was using it? 
Well, it looks like no one's in here right now. I'd better look elsewhere. 
Maybe I should take a break and swim in the pool. 
She isn't here. Hmm... But where could she be, then? 
Doesn't seem to be anyone at the pool. 
Guess I'll go somewhere else. 
I doubt Iris would go someplace like this while she's upset. 
Hmm... Then, where WOULD she go? 
I'm back here again. 
There's no way Iris would be here. I must be pretty out of it. 
I really don't think she'd be in a place like this. 
I guess I'll go check another room. 
It doesn't seem like anyone's been in here at all, so I doubt Iris has, either. 
I guess no one's here. Oh well, I'll go try another room. 
Oh, looks like Reni is over there. 
Hey, Reni! What are you up to? 
...Captain. 
I am inspecting my Eisenkleid. 
I see, so you came here to check up on it after today's battle. 
You're pretty diligent about these things, aren't you? 
... 
Reni... 
Keep talking. 
Get out of his way. 
(I don't really have much to talk about.) 
(Oh, I know. I'll try asking him about machines.) 
Reni, do you like machines, by any chance? 
...Like? 
Yeah, like. Or, you know, have a fondness for? 
... 
...If nothing else, they make more sense to me than people. They are not ruled by emotions. 
I need to continue my inspection, so I'll be going. 
Good grief, he's just as blunt as ever. 
But I think I understand him a little better. It seems as though he doesn't dislike machines, at least. 
Well, take it easy, then. I'll bet you feel more at ease when you're alone, huh? 
...That is true. 
I need to continue my inspection, so I'll be going. 
Well, I guess I should go look for Iris, myself. 
If you have no need of me, I'll be going. 
H-Hey, Reni! Hold on a minute! 
...There he goes. Man, I couldn't really strike up a conversation with him at all. 
It looks like Reni is still performing his inspection. 
I should get back to searching for Iris, myself. 
(I wonder where Reni went off to.) 
(Looks like he went back downstairs. Is he headed for the hangar?) 
It's already 11 o'clock. I wonder where Iris could've gone. 
Wait. Kayama said something earlier... 
I think it was... "try going to the attic." 
Well, what have I got to lose? Guess I'll try the attic. 
Ogami... 
Hm? 
Oh, Saki. Did you need something? 
Well you see, I wanted to speak to you alone. 
But perhaps not here... Could you please follow me? 
Sure, no problem. 
I'm busy right now. 
Sure, no problem. I'll go wherever you'd like. 
Thank you ever so much. Well then, if you'd please follow me. 
I'm busy right now. Iris disappeared somewhere, so I'm trying to find her. 
I see, so Iris is more important to you than I am... 
H-Hey, that's not what I said. 
Then, you'll listen to what I have to say? Thank you, Ogami! 
Let's go, then. There are so many things I'd like to discuss, just you and me. 
H-Hey, Saki! Don't just drag me around like this! 
Hmhmhm... Follow me, if you would. 
Hmmm, what should I do? 
If you have the time to think about it, I'd like for you to hear me out. 
Let's go, then. There are so many things I'd like to discuss, just you and me. 
H-Hey, Saki! Don't just drag me around like this! 
Hmhmhm... Follow me, if you would. 
This is... the prop room. What in the world did you want to discuss in here? 
Ogami... 
Iris doesn't seem to be here, either. 
I wonder where she could've gone. 
Ogami... 
Hm? 
Oh, Saki. Did you need something? 
Ogami... 
Please... Hold me... 
Eeep?! 
S-Saki, where did this come from all of a sudden? 
I'm so clueless about everything when it comes to working at this theater. The anxiety is too much. 
Please, Ogami, don't say anything more. Just hold me... 
Hold her. 
Refuse. 
All right. If I can really help... 
Ogami... 
Ah... N-Not so hard... 
Eeek! 
S-Saki?! 
I understand how you're feeling, but I must refuse. 
Me doing this might seem like an easy fix for you, but all it would do is gloss over your troubles. 
You'll get used to being here soon enough. Your anxiety will clear away even without me holding you. 
Ogami... 
Well, I should go. I'm in the middle of searching for Iris. 
Ah, Ogami, please wait... 
Eeek! 
S-Saki?! 
Ogami, won't you answer me? 
Y-Yeah, this is bad. 
I'm supposed to be looking for Iris. I'm sorry, Saki. 
Ah, Ogami, please wait... 
Eeek! 
S-Saki?! 
Saki, are you all right? 
My foot slipped, and... I fell down. 
Ogami, could you please do something to help? 
(Do something to help, she says, but what?) 
Arm (look) 
Hair (look) 
Face (look) 
Mouth (talk) 
Ankle (look) 
Chest (peek) 
Hips (look) 
Leg (peek) 
High heels (look) 
Offscreen (walk) 
Ogami, my ankle hurts more than there. Could you massage it, please? 
(I should probably take her arm and try to help her stand.) 
Arm (grab) 
Saki, I'll lend you my arm. Here, try to stand up. 
Oh my, thank you very much. 
(She has gorgeous black hair.) 
Hair (press) 
Eek! Ogami, please, don't touch me there. 
(It must hurt when she fell. Her face is scrunched up in pain.) 
Oh no... Please, don't look at my face when I'm like this. 
My ankle hurts. I wonder if I twisted it. 
Ogami, could you please massage my ankle? 
Saki, can you stand? 
My ankle hurts. I don't think I can do it alone. 
(It seems like she might have twisted her ankle.) 
Ankle (press) 
Saki, is this where it hurts? 
Ah... Yes, there... Ohh, that feels good... 
Just keep going... Massage it softly... Like that... 
Ohh, how nice... 
A little... harder... Please... 
No... Don't press it that hard... 
Gently, Ogami... 
(Wow, her chest is quite large...) 
(...Come on, Ogami! Now's not the time to be thinking about that!) 
Chest (press) 
Saki, is this where it hurts? 
Ah, that's my chest. 
Ogami, you're unexpectedly bold. 
You mustn't take advantage of this situation to do anything strange. 
(Damn... She saw right through me.) 
Chest (peek) 
(Phew, it really is big...) 
Saki, is your hip OK? 
Yes, my ankle is what got injured. 
But since you're checking me over, would you mind massaging my hip as well? 
Huhh?! Ohh, shoot. What now? 
Hips (press) 
Ahh, yes... Softly... Like that... 
Mhmhm... Ogami, you give such lovely massages. 
Y-You think so? Hahaha... 
Ahh, yes... Softly... Like that... 
(Ohh man, this is getting pretty sensual...) 
Oh, Ogami, please don't look at me that way. It's embarrassing. 
Leg (press) 
Saki, is this where it hurts? 
Ah, lower... Right on my ankle... 
Ah... No... Ogami... 
Don't press right there... 
Ogami, where are you going? 
How cruel of you to leave me here, when I can't even walk! 
OK, OK. I'll stay a bit longer. 
Please, Ogami, stay by my side a little longer... 
Wearing shoes like these, it's no wonder you slipped and fell. 
Saki, do you think you can stand? 
Yes, I think so. And the pain in my ankle is starting to lessen. 
That's good. Looks like you can walk, too. 
Yes, it's thanks to you, Ogami. 
You stayed with me this whole time after I fell. You're ever so kind. 
And you held me so gently... 
It made me so happy that you rubbed my hurt ankle for me. 
You rubbed my hurt ankle with such tenderness that I am filled with joy. 
Though it was unacceptable of you to stare so lustily at my legs... 
Oh, and you even rubbed my leg for me, too. Hmhmhm, thank you. 
Oh, and you even rubbed my leg for me. So thoroughly, too. 
I'm so very happy. Thank you ever so much. 
And on top of that, you even massaged my hip. I'm rather moved. 
Though it was unacceptable of you to let your hand "slip" and touch my chest... 
Though it was unacceptable of you to keep letting your hand "slip" and touch my chest... 
So, Ogami, that's the sort of thing you and Saki were doing together, was it? 
Eep?! That voice... 
S... Sakura!! 
Iris has gone missing, and here you are, fooling around! 
It seems I've interrupted something important, so pardon me. I'll be in my room! 
Sakura, wait! Please, listen to me! 
My ankle appears to have made a complete recovery thanks to your efforts, Ogami. 
How dreadful that Sakura became angry with you, though. Well, I bid you goodnight. 
S-Saki... 
The only reason this happened in the first place is because Saki forced me to come along with her... 
...but I guess I did get a little too carried away. 
Even so, I wish Sakura hadn't lost her temper at me like that. 
Oh man, I give up. 
Why Ogami, it's been an age! How good it is to see you well. Yes, that puts a smile on my face! 
Wh-Who's there? Who're you?! 
What?! Oh come now, come now! Did you forget all about me? What sort of friend are you? 
How could you forget me, Yuichi Kayama? I sat right next to you during our time in the naval academy! 
...Kayama?! 
So it's you, Kayama! Wow, you're looking a lot cooler these days. 
Anyway, what are you doing in a place like this? 
Ahh, it puts a smile on my face to see an old classmate once again... 
Answer the question, Kayama! Why are you even here? 
Come now, those little details hardly matter, do they? No, not at all! 
More importantly, isn't it true what they say? How rare is unsullied joy. 
If you keep on flouncing about with the ladies, Ogami, you may be in for a rude awakening. 
Uh... 
Now, if you'll pardon me. 
H-Hey, Kayama! 
Ah, yes. Ogami, why not try checking the attic? 
You may just find what you're looking for up there... 
Kayama...
