M-My… ideals… <br> How could… they…
If your ideals mean destroying everything the people hold dear, then they're wrong.
Protecting everyone's future… That is our justice!
You lot still don't get it!
Even if you defeat me here, it changes nothing!
This city must be destroyed once and for all. It must be purged.
There will come a day when someone arises to carry on my ideals.
And for their sake… <br> I will drag you all to Hell with me!
Kyogoku… This ends now!
