Captain, your orders today have been far too laxed.
Y-You think so? But now that I know you’re a girl…
I thought it might not be a good idea to issue you the same orders as before.
Judging one's capabilities based on their biological sex is not a good habit. Weak men exist too.
Consider the skills of your team and make effective use of their abilities. I can continue fighting. 
G-Got it…
