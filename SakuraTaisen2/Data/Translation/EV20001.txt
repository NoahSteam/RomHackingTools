Kouma are flying in from the starboard side!
It's… impossible to say how many!
Prepare to intercept!
Shoot them all down! All cannons, open fire!
All cannons, open fire!
It's no good! There's too many! We can't shoot them all!
Kouma have landed on the Mikasa's deck and begun to attack!
Guh… The downsides of having a gigantic weapon.
The Imperial Assault Troupe has arrived!
We're counting on you, Ogami! You must not let the Mikasa fall here!
Right! We'll take care of the Kouma up here on deck!
OK, let's go, everyone!
