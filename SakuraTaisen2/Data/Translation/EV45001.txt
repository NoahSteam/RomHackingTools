That's far enough, Tsuchigumo.
Heh… <br> The battle's not over yet.
You've lost, accept it!
Spare us the sour grapes!
Just accept defeat already!
C'mon, no one likes a sore loser!
Even if you don't wanna admit it, you lost!
You just don't know when to give up, do ya!
She is such a sore loser!
…
It looks like I have your undivided attention, huh.
Come out, Kouma!
C-Crap, the engine room!
Don't worry, I'll be sure to hunt all you down myself.
Now, my Kouma! Squeeze the life from the Mikasa!
Stop right there!
You'll go no further!
Stop right there!
Time's up!
You're not going any further!
Hold it right there!
This is as far as you go!
Hold it.
The Imperial Assault Troupe has arrived!

E-Everyone!
You can relax, Ogami! <br> We'll take care of the Kouma down here!
Apologies for the wait, Ensign. Victory is all but assured now that we're here!
Leave the Kouma to us, sir. You take care of Tsuchigumo!
Sorry to keep you waitin', Boss! We'll take care of these guys!
We'll handle things here, so you try your best too, Mon Frère!
We got things covered here! We're not letting the Mikasa go down!
You have nothing to worry about, Mr. Ensign! Kouma like these will be a piece of cake!
You handle things over there, Captain. We'll defend the engine room.
Hmph! Once I'm done with these pests, the rest of you down there are next on the chopping block!
You're too late, anyway. It won’t be long now before this hunk of junk falls out of the sky!
We won't let that happen! Here we come, Tsuchigumo!
Come at me! I'll hunt down every last one of you!
