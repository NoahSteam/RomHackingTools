Reni, are you OK? Are you hurt?
I-Iris…
I'm sorry, I made you all -
It's OK… Everyone is fine.
All that matters is that you came back to us. Right, Mon Frère?
Reni… Did you find something worth protecting?
Yes. Captain, what I want to protect… are my dear friends and comrades.
Hee hee! Welcome back, Reni!
I'm back, Iris.
