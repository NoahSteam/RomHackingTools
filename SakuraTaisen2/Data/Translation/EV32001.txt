Heheheh… Protecting that old coot in the middle of combat is sure to slow down even the Assault Troupe.
This fancy restaurant will get burnt to a nice, blackened crisp at this rate, heheheh. Still…
…There's no reason I can't have a little bit more fun.
The sight of faces twisted in agony, heheheh… It's simply irresistible!
The Imperial Assault Troupe has arrived!!
Yikes! The damage here is pretty extensive…
Hopefully the civilians made it out OK…
Not to worry. We've already evacuated any nearby civilians.
All that's left is for you to stop the Black Demon Society's advance! Give it your all!
Which means the only one who's yet to evacuate is Mr. Yamaguchi…
Hm…? <br> Do you mean me?
…Mr. Yamaguchi!
Oh, is that you? <br> The youngster from before?
I'll act as a decoy. In the meantime, you'll evacuate to a safe location by car!
Relax, pops, it's fine. Just leave everything to us.
Right, if you insist, then I'll do as you say. I'm counting on you.
Yes, sir! All you have to do is trust us.
By the way, Chief, about that safe location…
Pops here will need to go to that spot over there.
You got that, Chief? We gotta keep the enemy away from that area!
Roger! <br> OK, everyone, let's go!
Ah, young man!
Yes?
Don't do anything rash. <br> Proceed with caution.
…Yes, sir!
