To think, the year's almost over. 
You're right. It's already December and the weather's gotten really frigid. 
I'm not an early bird already, so this season is always hard for me. 
Lower temperatures tend to slow down the body's ability to move as well. 
But if it snows, we can build a snowman or have a snowball fight. 
It'll be loads of fun! 
Everyone here seems to have different opinions on winter, eh? 
What about you, Chief? Do you like winter or are you not a fan?
I like winter. 
I don't like winter... 
I like it. The cold never bothered me much. 
Huh... What's so great about winter? 
Well... 
Playing winter games.
Having delicious hot pots.
Kotatsu and oranges? 
There's all kinds of games you can play in the winter. 
Yeah! Snowball fights are the best! 
Sports such as skiing and skating can only be enjoyed in winter as well. 
Uh-huh... Is that all? 
Hot pots are great. Even just gathering around the pot with everyone is fun. 
Hot pot? 
It’s a meal where various foods are cooked inside a pot of boiling broth and everyone eats from it.
That’s right! It’s super tasty and warms your body…
But above all else, it's just fun to have everyone gather around and eat together.
Ooh, is that so? 
I kind of like to just laze around under a kotatsu and eat some mandarin oranges.
Ehehe. Oh, Ogami. But, yes, that certainly is nice.
Kotatsu? What's that? 
A kotatsu is... Well, uh... It's covered with a heavy blanket, and... 
Um... It's kind of hard to explain. 
A kotatsu is a Japanese heating device. 
It's a table covered with a blanket where burning charcoal briquettes underneath warm the body.
Well, when we put the kotatsu out, you'll understand once you try it. 
Uh... Now that I think of it, I don't really know what's so great about winter. 
At least it's better than summer, I guess? 
That’s all you have to say? What a boring answer.
I feel like an idiot for even asking.
I don’t really like winter. I can’t stand the cold…
Tee-hee! Mon Frère doesn’t like getting chilly!
But on the bright side, winter makes all kinds of food taste more delicious. 
Yeah! Hot pot with everyone gathered around is the best! 
Ah, winter. Huh... I can't say whether I like it or not. 
Traveling all over the world on that training voyage... 
It made me realize that Japan's four seasons are all beautiful. It's hard to choose a favorite myself. 
...That's true. I also love all the seasons in Japan.
To me, winter is my favorite. It's the season where I can enjoy all kinds of kimonos. 
Heh, just like how a bagworm wraps themselves up in the winter. 
You're one to talk, eating all those extra meals lately. Are you preparing to hibernate or something?
Now you've done it, Sumire. It’s been a while since our last fight. Ya ready to rumble?!
Oh goodness, you two never change. 
We're going to be rehearsing for our Christmas play, remember? So cut it out, you two.
Christmas play? 
Yes. It's called "The Miracle Bells." 
A special one-night production about the miracle of Christmas…
The performance will be held on Christmas Eve and the lead will play the role of the Holy Mother.
I can't wait. 
Who’s playing the lead?
A special one-night event, huh? I can’t wait.
This will be the Flower Division's last play of the year. 
Everyone is excited to give a spectacular performance, so look forward to it. 
By the way, who's going to be the lead for this play? 
Well, you see... 
Hm? 
We already have candidates for the role... 
But we still haven't made the final decision on who gets to play the Holy Mother. 
Oh... 
Mon Frère, we'll do our best... 
So do your best for the play, too. OK? 
Me? 
I-Iris! 
Oh... 
You meant to wish him luck with his ticket punching duties, right, Iris?
Y-Yeah! Good luck, Mon Frère! 
All right, everyone. It's time to begin our rehearsal. 
OK! Bring it on! 
Well, Captain, we must be off. 
Feel free to stop by and watch if you’d like, Ogami. 
Christmas performance, huh? I wonder what kind of play it'll end up being. 
Ogami. 
Need something, Kaede? 
I'd like to speak with you alone for a bit.
Can you come to my room in about 30 minutes? 
30 minutes, that'll be 4:45 PM, then. 
Yes. I'll be waiting for you. 
I wonder what Kaede wants to talk about. 
For now, I'll just walk around the theater to kill some time. 
Sorry, Ogami. I can only sell you one photo per month. 
I see. That's too bad. 
So sorry, Mr. Ogami, but each customer is only allowed to purchase one photo at a time.
Oh, really? That's too bad.
