I coulda sworn this was the rendezvous point Suiko picked out…
Is this not it? Fine, we'll check somewhere else.
Kongou?! <br> Why's he here, I didn't even give him the signal!
And what's more, he got lost, that idiot!
All those troops, gone to waste! Unbelievable!
But wait… Did the Assault Troupe also know about the reinforcements? No, there's no way…
Looks like everything went according to plan. OK, just a bit more, now!
