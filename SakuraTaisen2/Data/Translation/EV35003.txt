The Imperial Assault Troupe has arrived!!
Sorry we're late, sir.
…Hey! Isn't the Reni over there? She's looking real weird!
She's being controlled by the enemy. <br> …By Saki!
Why, that creep…! <br> C'mon, Boss, let's all go save Reni!
No, wait… <br> Leave Reni to me, I'll talk to her.
Huh?! But why, Ogami?
When Reni confided her worries to me… I didn't give her a good enough answer.
So that's why, this time… I have to save her!
…Understood. <br> We'll leave her in your hands, Captain.
In the meantime, we'll hold the enemies off until you've talked Reni down!
Losing Reni would be catastrofico for the global theater community!
So don't mess this up, okay, Mr. Ensign?
Yeah, I've got this. <br> I'll get Reni out of there.
