Well, we're safely on the road. 
Yes, it looks like it'll be another few hours before we reach Atami. 
Got it. Guess I'll just sit back and enjoy a peaceful bus ride. 
Hey, Mon Frère? 
Hm? What is it, Iris? 
I was playing cards just now in the back of the bus, with Sakura and the others. 
If you want, you and Maria can come join us! 
Oh, me too? What game are we playing? 
We're playing Tycoon. You two seem like you'd be great at it! 
Come on, Mon Frère, play with us! 
Sure, let's play! 
What are the rules? 
Let's not. 
Sure, let's play! It'll be a nice way to pass the time till we reach Atami. 
Really? <br> I’m so glad we asked then.
All right, but I won't lose! 
I won't hold anything back, either. 
OK then, let the game begin! 
Tycoon, huh? Could you tell me the rules? 
Sure. I'll explain it as simply as I can. 
The least we could do is join them, Captain. 
Yeah, you're right. OK, once you've explained the rules, let's play! 
Hmm… Let's not. I was hoping to take a nap before we reach Atami. 
Huhhh? Boring… 
He can't help it if he's tired, Iris. 
We'll play a round of Old Maid with Saki instead, all right? 
OK… 
Sorry about that, Ogami. Get plenty of rest. 
*yawn* <br> Now that I've turned them down, I’m starting to feel really sleepy. 
It'll be some time before we get to Atami, so I'll just take a quick nap. 
Boss? Wake up, Boss. 
Mm… Mmrrgh… 
*yawn* <br> I slept like a log. 
Hmmm… What should I do? 
C’mon, it’ll be fun! Don’t you want to play, Mon Frère?
Ogami's probably tired, Iris. He’ll join us for a game some other time.
We'll play a round of Old Maid with Saki instead, OK? 
Ah, Boooriiiing… 
Sorry about that, Ogami. Get plenty of rest. 
*yawn* <br> Now that I've turned them down, I’m starting to feel really sleepy. 
It'll be some time before we get to Atami, so I'll just take a quick nap. 
…Boss? <br> Wake up, Boss. 
Mm… Mmrrgh… 
*yawn* <br> I slept like a log. 
Figures you’d be a talented card player, Ogami.
It's true! You're so good, Mon Frère! 
You really know how to use your head, don't you? 
Hahaha, thanks. 
That wasn't bad, Ogami. 
Well, that's the way it goes, I guess. 
But it was a great way to pass the time all the same. 
That was fun, Mon Frère! Let's play again sometime! 
That's too bad, Ogami. 
Oof, that wasn't great. 
Cheer up, Mon Frère. 
It's all a matter of luck… 
You're right. Thanks, everyone. 
Yo, Boss! <br> We're almost there! 
Really? Time sure flew by. 
We'll be able to see the ocean shortly. 
This looks to be the place. We're here! 
“Kenrokuen," was it called? You can really feel the history behind this building. 
Ken… roku… en? 
I'm told this inn is quite famous, and has been in operation since the Edo period. 
We appear to be the only guests staying here, so we can take it easy. 
It's so peaceful and quiet. Looks like a tranquil place to relax. 
Hey, guys! I know this is kinda sudden, but y'all wanna go see the beach? 
From the bus, it looked like it's close by. How 'bout it, Boss? 
Sure, let's take a look. 
I need a break… 
Yeah, sure, let's take a look. 
That's what I'm talkin' about! All right, full steam ahead! 
Hmmmm… We just got here. I'd like to take a break first. 
C'mon, Boss, don't be such a downer. 
We might as well have a look, Ogami. 
A walk and a breath of fresh ocean air should do us some good. 
Yeah, Mon Frère! Let's go to the beach! 
Well, if you all insist… Why not? 
Hmmm… What should I do? 
C'mon, Boss, we've got plenty of time before dinner. 
A walk will get us nice and hungry, and we'll be back just in time to eat! 
Yeah, Mon Frère! Let's go to the beach! 
You're right. OK, let's go. 
Alrighty then, let's drop off our bags and head to the beach. 
The beach, huh? Can't wait. 
Oh, yeah… You probably never went to the beach much in Russia, did you, Maria? 
That's right. It's so cold in Russia, going to the beach would be ludicrous. 
Heh! That means now's your chance! 
OK, Flower Division, to the beach! Move out! 
Yahoo! Look at that ocean! 
Wow… The ocean's so pretty! 
We can play so much tomorrow! 
There's lots of stuff you can do at the beach. What are you gonna do, Chief? 
I'll just go swimming. 
Probably sunbathing. 
Smash watermelons, I guess? 
I think I'll just go swimming. I do come from the Navy, after all. 
Ooh, how cool! 
That makes sense. <br> Maybe you could teach me proper swimming technique sometime. 
Hahaha, sure. If you want, then I'd be happy to. 
I'll probably go sunbathing. 
Huh, that's a very European pastime, Mr. Ensign! 
Sunbathing on a private beach is a staple of European vacations. 
I, too, enjoy going for a swim and gracefully lounging on the beach. 
Taking care not to get sunburnt, of course. 
I see… That sounds about right for you, Sumire. 
I guess we could all smash a few watermelons? 
OK! I love watermelon smashing! 
That'd be my pick, too. It's great for getting everyone fired up! 
OK then, we'll smash some watermelons when we head down to the beach for a swim. 
All right! I'll go get some watermelons ready then. 
Heehee! Yaaay! <br> I can't wait! 
What's wrong, Chief? 
Oh. Sorry. <br> Guess I kinda spaced out… 
Ahahaha! C'mon, Chief, keep it together! 
Though I guess tuning everything out and looking at the ocean isn't so bad, either. 
Right, let's head back to the inn, everyone. 
Yeah! Once we're back, we can get our grub on! 
Beach this, grub that… <br> You truly are simpleminded. 
What was that?! 
Ohohohoho! <br> Come and get me! 
Grr, now you've done it! Wait right there, dammit! 
Good grief… <br> Those two never change. 
Well then, everyone, let's start heading back. 
Yeah. <br> Come on, Reni, let's go. 
…OK.
I can't wait to get back and take a shower. 
Heehee, don't you mean go in the hot springs, Orihime? 
Alrighty, let's go. <br> We'll go on ahead, Chief. 
Sure. I'll be right there. 
The sea… It sure brings me back to my time in the Navy. 
Yo, Ogami! 
Wh-Who's there?! 
K-Kayama?! 
Hey, Ogami. Ahh, how lovely the actual ocean is… 
Getting to gaze at the sea with you like this… <br> What a joy it is! 
Yes, the sea is lovely. 
What are you doing here? 
Yes, the sea is lovely. 
Indeed. 
What are you doing here? 
Ogami, please. Does a man need a reason to come gaze at the sea? 
That's… not the point. 
… 
That's fine, Ogami. Words are meaningless before the majesty of the ocean blue. 
You're here with me, and we have the ocean in front of us. That's more than enough. 
R-Right… 
A man's heart must be vast and wide like the ocean. 
And he must have the perspective broad enough to gaze upon such a vast body of water. 
They say, "The frog in the well knows not of the ocean." You must never be that frog. 
I get what you're trying to say, but… what's your deal? 
Hahaha! <br> Well, I must be going now! 
Adiòs, Ogami! <br> Until we meet again! 
Kayama… Seriously, what's with that guy? 
Let's eat! 
All right, time to chow down! 
Kanna, you'll choke on your food if you don't slow down. 
*gulp* <br> …Grrk! 
See? Enough said! 
Hahaha, relax, Kanna, the food's not going anywhere. 
Th-This fish is… <br> It's raw!! 
We call that "sashimi," Orihime. 
Sa-shi-mi? How am I supposed to eat this?! 
You eat it as-is. 
With wasabi and soy sauce.
You don't, it's decorative. 
You eat it as-is. 
With wasabi and soy sauce.
I'll eat yours if you want.
You just eat it the way it is, Orihime. 
Really? Well, here goes… 
… 
It doesn't have a lot of flavor. 
It tastes great when you add a little soy sauce to it, Orihime. 
Ohhh, I see, you have to put sauce on it. 
How dare you trick me, Mr. Ensign! 
N-No, I just think you should enjoy its pure flavor without adding anything to it… 
Enough of your excuses! 
You add some soy sauce and a little wasabi to it, then eat it. 
Hmm… Well, here goes nothing. 
… 
Urk! My nose! It stings! 
Hahaha, that's the wasabi. The tingling feels nice, doesn't it? 
Phew… It's so intense, my eyes are starting to water. 
But it has a fresh flavor you do not find in Europe. I think I like it. 
It's decorative, you don't eat it. 
Really? Kohran seems to be enjoying it, though. 
C'mon, Chief, you shouldn't tease Orihime like that. 
It tastes great when you add a little soy sauce to it, Orihime. 
How dare you trick me, Mr. Ensign! 
S-Sorry, I was just joking. 
I'll eat it if you don't want it, I love sashimi. 
I don't NOT want it! I’m not about to surrender any of my food to a Japanese man!
O-OK… 
I'll give you my sashimi, Mon Frère! 
Huh? Are you sure, Iris? 
Mamma mia, and now you're leeching off of a child? You're terrible. 
C'mon, Orihime, stop bullying the chief so much. 
Orihime, you eat sashimi with soy sauce and a little wasabi. 
Hmm… Well, here goes nothing. 
… 
Urk! My nose! It stings! 
That's the wasabi kicking in. Startled me, too, the first time I tried it. 
Once you get used to it, though, you can't get enough of that tingling sensation! 
Phew… It's so intense, my eyes are starting to water. 
But it has a fresh flavor you do not find in Europe. I think I like it. 
Heehee… Looks like you don't have any problem with wasabi at all, Reni. 
Wasabi… A perennial herb of the Brassicaceae family. Its roots contain irritants. 
So long as you can receive nutrition from it, it doesn't matter how it tastes. 
Same as ever, I see, Reni… 
Hey! I need a refill! 
Heehee… And Kanna’s the same as ever, too. 
Hahahaha… 
Ahh, that was yummy! <br> I'm so full! 
Heh, suppose I should eat in moderation and cut it off here. 
Goodness, you ate three pots' worth of rice… <br> You're inhuman! 
By the way, where's the bedroom? 
In a traditional Japanese inn like this, Orihime, we roll out futons and sleep on the floor together. 
Huh?! Together?! You mean with Mr. Ensign, too?! 
O-Of course not! I'm sleeping in a different room! 
Well, why not? Let's all sleep together. How about it, Ogami? 
Well, if you insist… 
That's a bad idea. 
Well, if you insist… 
Wh-What are you saying, Ogami! 
Saki, please stop kidding around. 
There is no way on earth I'm sharing the same room as a Japanese man! 
R-Right… That's too bad. 
No, that's a bad idea. I may be the captain, but I have to exercise some restraint. 
Really? That's too bad. 
But still, it's wonderful how disciplined you are, Ogami. 
R-Right… 
(…Sleeping together with everyone, eh?) 
Ogami? What's with that look on your face? 
Obviously he is thinking dirty thoughts! 
H-Hey, why's everyone ganging up on me?! 
All right, that's enough chit-chat. Let's get ready for bed. 
Wait, Maria, aren't you forgetting something important? 
When you're staying at an inn, there's one thing you gotta do! 
Kohran, you don't mean… 
That's right! A pillow fight! A traditional Chinese pastime dating back 4,000 years! 
All right, count me in! Prepare yourself, Sumire! 
How amusing. Just don't come crying to me once this is over. 
N-Now hold on, everyone! 
Relax, it'll be fine. <br> OK, ready? Begin! 
BWAH! Who did that?! Who threw that pillow at me outta nowhere?! 
Hahaha! Gotta stay frosty, Kohran! 
All right, Sumire! Time for us to counterattack! 
It seems push has come to shove! Prepare yourselves! 
Look out! 
Cover Sakura. 
Cover Iris. 
Cover Kanna. 
Sakura… I’ll protect you! 
You handle this one! 
Leave it to me! 
Gwargh! 
Thank you, Ogami! 
Iris… You can relax, I'm at your side. 
You handle this one! 
Leave it to me! 
Gwargh! 
You came to my rescue! 
Kanna, I'll protect you with all I've got! 
You handle this one! 
Leave it to me! 
Gwargh! 
Sorry 'bout that, Boss. 
You handle this one! 
Leave it to me! 
Aaaargh! 
Ah… 
Damn, now you've done it! 
All right, here I come! 
Reni, you help, too! It'll be good exercise for you! 
Roger. <br> Target… acquired. 
L-Look out! 
Cover Sumire. 
Cover Kohran. 
Cover Maria. 
Sumire, let me be your shield. 
Providing cover fire… 
Over here! 
Gwargh! 
Ensign… I'm so glad… 
Kohran… I'll always be there to help you. 
Providing cover fire… 
Over here! 
Gwargh! 
Th-Thanks a bunch, Chief… 
Maria, I've got your back. 
Providing cover fire… 
Over here! 
Gwargh! 
Apologies, Captain. 
…Or not! Chestohhh! 
Eek! 
Ah! 
H-How dare you! 
Hehehhh! Serves ya right! 
Come on, Sakura, let's throw one too! 
O-OK, then, here I come! 
L… Look out… 
Cover Orihime. 
Cover Reni. 
Cover Saki. 
Orihime, you can count on me when the going gets rough! 
Sakura! 
On it! 
Gwargh! 
I can't believe I was saved by a Japanese man… 
Reni, it's OK to be protected sometimes. 
Sakura! 
On it! 
Gwargh! 
… 
Saki! I will protect you! 
Sakura! 
On it! 
Gwargh! 
Oh my, you protected me? I'm so happy… 
I'll leave this one to you! 
Here I gooo! 
… 
Ah! 
…Injuries sustained, minimal. 
Phew… 
Time for the finishing blow! Here I come! Toryaaaaahh! 
Aww, crap! 
The pillow ripped open! 
Oh, for goodness sake… That's enough, everybody. 
I'm glad the innkeepers forgave us so graciously… 
But let's make sure this never happens again, OK, everyone? 
Yes, ma'am… 
And Captain, it's your job to stop this sort of thing before it gets out of hand. 
You're right. Sorry. 
Eh, it's no big deal. 
You're right. Sorry. I'll be more careful from now on. 
Very well. As long as you're sorry, then. 
Eh, it's no big deal. What happens in Atami, stays in Atami, right? 
What are you saying?! What kind of guests would we be if we can’t even follow the simplest of rules?! 
You're the captain, now start acting like it! 
Y-Yes, ma'am! I apologize. 
… 
It seems you're remorseful for what you did. 
All right then, let's all go to bed for the night. 
We can play around as much as we want outside, OK? 
Yes, ma'am! Let's roll out the futons, then. 
Sorry for speaking so harshly, sir. 
It's OK, Maria. You were right. 
I'll head over to my room, then. Good night, everybody. 
Good night, Mon Frère! 
Good night, Captain. 
Phew… What a day it's been. 
Still, it was pretty fun. 
Now to get a good night's sleep to prepare for tomorrow. 
(I can hear waves…) 
(Oh, right. We're close to the beach, aren't we…) 
(…) 
Ensign… 
…Hm? 
Eeensiiign… 
That voice… 
S-Sumi-- 
Shh, quiet. 
Did you… need something? 
Did you have a nightmare? 
You shouldn't be up!
Did you… need something? 
Did you have a nightmare? You can sleep next to me, if you're scared. 
Alas, I haven't had any nightmares. 
Oh. So what's the matter? 
Sumire, you shouldn't be up this late! 
My, and I came all this way to extend an invitation to you. 
I-Invitation? 
… 
Yes, stay quiet, just like that. 
Tomorrow, the others plan on inviting you to go to the beach, the mountains, or the hot spring. 
But I'd love to go to the beach with you more than anything. 
How does that sound, Ensign? 
S-Sumire… 
Hold it right there! 
… 
Eep! N-No way… 
Sumire… Trying to pull a fast one, huh? 
My, whatever could you mean? 
Quit hogging Mon Frère all to yourself! 
Seriously, that's pretty low, Sumire! 
Hmph, I was just inviting the ensign to come with us tomorrow! Is that so wrong?! 
Wh-What did you say?! 
Well, it doesn't seem like Ogami minds. 
*sigh* <br> Just goes to show, you can't be too careful around Japanese men. 
What do you have to say for yourself, Ogami? 
Laugh it off. 
Pretend to be asleep. 
Get angry. 
Ha, hahaha… <br> I, uh, don't really know what's going on, either… 
Come on! Out with it! 
Zzz… Zzz… 
Ensign! Quit pretending to be asleep! 
Explain yourself, right now! 
B-But I don't… 
All of you, knock it off! I was just trying to get some sleep! 
It's late. Go back to your room and go to bed! 
The captain's right! 
Out with it, Ogami! 
Out with what? I didn't do anything… 
Sumire, didn't I just say not to cause a ruckus? 
All of you are being too noisy! What time do you think it is? 
But Maria… 
But nothing. Everyone go back to your room. 
Apologies for all the noise, Captain. 
N-No, it's all right. 
If you'll excuse me, then. Good night. 
Yeah, good night. 
Good grief… A noisy day to the very end. 
I wonder… how… tomorrow… will be… 
*yawn* <br> Now I… really feel… sleepy… 
Mm… Zzz… 
Mmm… Morning, huh? The weather outside seems nice, at least. 
Right, now to get changed and meet up with the others. 
Ah, good morning, Ogami! 
Morning, everyone. <br> Nice weather outside. 
Uh-huh! We were just talking about where we're gonna go after breakfast! 
We've decided we're all going to the beach tomorrow… 
But since everyone wants to go to different places today, we're splitting up into three groups. 
Kohran, Orihime, and I are headed for the mountains. A hike oughta be pretty fun! 
I'll be taking Iris and Reni to the beach, like I told you last night.
Maria, Saki, and I are planning on staying here and relaxing in the hot springs. 
What are you going to do, Ogami? 
Go to the beach. 
Go mountain hiking. 
Relax at the inn. 
I'll go to the beach. It's been a while since I've had a swim in the ocean. 
You're just saying that because you want to see my swimsuit, don't you? 
Haha, sure, whatever you say. 
Yaaay, Mon Frère's coming with us! Isn't that great, Reni? 
…I guess. 
I'll go to the mountains. Hiking's pretty fun, every now and then. 
Right? We're going to the beach tomorrow, anyway! 
Oh? If Mr. Ensign is coming, then maybe I should stay here. 
C'mon, don't be like that! Let's all get along! 
I think I'll stay at the inn and relax in the hot spring. 
I see, so you'll be here with us, then. 
Try to relax as much as you can, Captain. 
Ogami is staying here with us? Heehee, I'm looking forward to it. 
All right, once breakfast is over, everyone get ready and meet up at the entrance if you're heading out! 
Okey-dokey! 
Sorry Ogami, but customers are only allowed to purchase one of each bromide. 
I see. That's too bad. 
So sorry, Mr. Ogami, but customers are only allowed to purchase one of each bromide.
Oh, really? That's too bad.
