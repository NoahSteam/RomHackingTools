Fwohoho… <br> The Imperial Theater's defensive curtain is proving to be very useful…
Urgh… <br> Is Kayama still not ready?
Wh-What is this?! <br> What's going on?!
Hahahaha! <br> "Good things come to those who wait," eh, Ogami?
Kayama, you're a lifesaver! Now we can turn things around!
Yes, but we can't rest easy just yet. Mokujiki still has his turrets.
They have considerable firepower. Be careful, Ogami.
Got it! <br> Thanks for the assist!
Right. See you, Ogami! <br> And stay frosty! Hahahaha!
Ngh… Once again, I have made a careless oversight.
But no amount of mistakes will rob me of my victory…
