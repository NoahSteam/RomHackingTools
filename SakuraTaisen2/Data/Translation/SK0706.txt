I see, so you're a member of the Imperial Assault Troupe... 
In that case, I know they'll come to save you. 
But... They'd never walk into an obvious trap like this. 
Besides, I... I've always said such horrible things to them. 
No, he... Ogami will definitely come for you. That's the kind of man he is. 
He wouldn't run away like me... 
Papa... 
You have to believe in your friends, Orihime... And in Ogami. 
... 
Ensign... 
Orihime!! Ogata!! Are you all right?! 
That voice... 
Orihime! Thank god you're OK! 
Ensign... Ensign!! 
It's all right now. I'm coming over there. 
Your chariot awaits, Orihime. 
O-OK! 
Sorry I'm late, Ogata. 
Thank you, Ogami. 
Ensign... You really came back for me. 
Because we're partners. 
Even a Japanese man can rise to the occasion. 
Of course I did. We're the Flower Division, we're partners. 
The others and I will always be there for you. 
Ensign... 
See? Even a Japanese man can rise to the occasion sometimes. 
Hm hm... You are ever so slightly late, though. 
Still... I might've misjudged you. 
S-Sorry... I never know what to say at times like this. 
You don't have to say a word... 
Huh? 
You came back for me. That's more than enough. 
All right, now's not the time to be loafing around, Ensign! 
Yeah. We've got a job to do. 
Ogami... Please... Look after Orihime. 
I will, sir. 
Papa... I have to go, for the people I care about. 
And I'll protect everyone, no matter what! 
Sorry, Ogami, but each customer is only allowed to purchase one photo at a time. 
I see. That's too bad.

Oh, really? That's too bad.
