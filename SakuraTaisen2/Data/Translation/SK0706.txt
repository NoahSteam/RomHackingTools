I see, so you're a member of the Imperial Assault Troupe... 
In that case, I’m sure your teammates are on their way to rescue you. 
But... They would never rush into such an obvious trap. 
Besides, I… <br> I've said such horrible things to them…
No, he... <br> Ogami will definitely come for you. That's the kind of man he is. 
He wouldn't run away like me... 
Papa... 
You have to believe in your friends, Orihime... And in Ogami. 
... 
Mr. Ensign... 
Orihime!! Ogata!! <br> Are you all right?! 
That voice... 
Orihime! <br> Thank God you're OK! 
Mr. Ensign... <br> Mr. Ensign!! 
It's all right now. I’m on my way. 
I've come back for you, Orihime. 
…Y-Yes! 
Sorry I'm late, Ogata. 
Thank you, Ogami. 
Mr. Ensign... You really came back for me. 
Because we're partners. 
Japanese men aren't so bad.
Of course I did. We're the Flower Division, we're partners. 
The others and I will always be there for you. 
Mr. Ensign... 
See? Even a Japanese man can rise to the occasion sometimes. 
Hm hm... You are ever so slightly late, though. 
Still... I might've misjudged you. 
S-Sorry... I never know what to say at times like this. 
You don't have to say a word... 
Huh? 
You came back for me. That's more than enough. 
All right, now's not the time to be loafing around, Mr. Ensign! 
Yeah. We've got a job to do. 
Ogami... Please... Look after Orihime. 
I will, sir. 
Papa... I have to go. For the sake of the ones I hold dear.
For the sake of everyone! I'll protect them all, no matter what!
Sorry, Ogami. I can only sell you one bromide per month. 
I see. That's too bad. 
So sorry, Mr. Ogami, but each customer is only allowed to purchase one bromide at a time.
Oh, really? That's too bad.
