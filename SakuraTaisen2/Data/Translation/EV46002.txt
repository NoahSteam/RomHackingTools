I can't believe… I've been defeated by these… wretched humans…
Heheh… <br> I might not look like one, but I, too, am human.
I've been despised my entire life… All because of this body.

I would gladly give my life to get my revenge on humankind!

My head hurts…

…I think I might know why. But that explanation can wait till we're back on the bridge.
Got it. <br> All units, back to base!
