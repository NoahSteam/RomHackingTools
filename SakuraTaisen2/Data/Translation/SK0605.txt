Ah, Mon Frère! 
Iris?! What are you doing up this late?! 
I stopped by Reni's room just now. 
I knocked on the door, but she didn't answer. 
That's strange… Where could she be at this hour? 
I feel nervous for some reason. My heart won't stop pounding. 
Almost like… Reni's going to leave us. 
Like she's going somewhere far away. 
Come with me, Mon Frère! I wanna go to Reni's room one more time. 
I see. Well I AM worried about her… 
Come on, let’s go. Follow me, Iris.
OK… 
All right, we're here. 
Still no answer. 
Mon Frère… 
Hm? The door's open. 
…OK, Iris, let’s go inside.
…Right.
Reni? We're coming in… 
Sure enough, she's not here. 
Ah! Mon Frère, look over there! 
Isn't that the flower crown you made for her? 
Did Reni… throw it away? 
No, she looked so happy when you gave it to her. 
That's strange… I have a bad feeling about this. 
Ah, Chief! There you are! 
Kohran?! 
What's wrong, Kohran?! Did something happen?! 
Just now… Reni took her Eisenkleid and ran off! 
Wha-What did you say?! 
She just showed up in the hangar, then booked it before I had the chance to stop her. 
And her eyes, there was something weird about 'em. 
Almost like… she was possessed or something. 
Reni… 
Damn it! We have an emergency. Round everyone up and report to the war room, stat! 
Roger! 
Reni… What the hell's going on?! 
Ah, there you are, Ogami. 
Kaede? What are you doing here this late? 
You haven't seen Saki Kageyama around, have you, Ogami? 
Huh? Saki? No, can't say that I have. 
What's wrong, Kaede? You usually never address Saki by her full name like that…
I'll explain later. Sorry, I have to go, I'm in a hurry. 
Kaede looked really on edge. I wonder what's wrong. 
Nobody's here. I'm all alone in this lobby. 
Well, this is kinda depressing. I should go somewhere else. 
Man, it’s really stormy out. Been a while since we’ve had weather like this.
OK, the doors are shut tight, and it doesn't look like anyone's outside. 
The auditorium is totally soundproofed, so you can't even hear the storm from in here. 
Well, nothing unusual here. I should go. 
Nothing unusual at the shop. 
The storm doesn't seem like it's letting up anytime soon. The wind's getting louder and louder. 
All you can hear right now is the wind. 
Well, I should go somewhere else. Nothing particularly unusual here. 
I hope we're prepped for a fire. Fires are pretty common in storms like this. 
…OK, inspection complete. Nothing out of the ordinary here. I should move on. 
The rain is so loud against the glass, it sounds like someone's knocking on a door. 
…OK, looks like it's shut tight. I should move on. 
Kasumi and Yuri have long since left the theater. 
Well, no problems here in the office. Time to move on. 
Zzzzzz… Zzzzzz… 
The manager's snoring so loud, it's giving the storm a run for its money. 
I don't think I need to check on this room. 
Nobody's here… 
I should go. If the piano starts playing by itself, I'm gonna freak out. 
The wardrobe room at night… It's kinda creepy, I don't think I want to stick around here too long. 
Doesn't seem like anything's out of the ordinary. I should get going. 
Feels kinda lonely to be in the dressing room with no one else around. 
Nothing unusual here. I should keep moving. 
The door to the courtyard's shut tight. 
I don't think I'd want to go out in the pouring rain anyway. Guess I'll get going. 
This place sorta gives me the creeps. 
I should get going. Nothing's going to change by me sticking around here. 
It's so quiet in here, like there wasn't even a storm at all. The room's perfectly soundproofed. 
Well, nothing unusual here. Where to next? 
Only thing I might find here is a mouse or something. 
Nothing unusual. Moving on. 
I wonder what Sakura's up to. 
Sakura? It's me, Ogami. 
Oh, Ogami… 
You really came. I'm so glad… 
What's wrong, Sakura? Are you all right? 
KYAAAAH! 
Sakura! Are you OK?! 
N-No… Not really. 
I thought I'd gotten used to the thunder, but… I guess I'm still scared of it after all. 
Sakura… 
Go inside and hold her. 
Cheer her up from outside. 
Sakura, could you let me in? 
Huh? W-Why? 
Uh, I thought I'd come in and give you a hug. 
Huh?! 
I'm flattered, Ogami, really… 
But I probably shouldn't be letting boys into my room at this hour, sorry. 
I-I see. Hmmm, that's too bad… 
Sheesh, Ogami… 
I'm patrolling right now, and I shouldn't be going inside any of the girls' rooms this late at night…
But if you want, I can stay with you out here. You can relax. 
Ogami… 
Ogami… Could you… answer me back? 
Ogami… 
(What a cute nameplate, it suits Sakura perfectly) 
…Ogami? 
What is it, Sakura? 
Thank goodness. I thought you might have left. 
… 
…Ogami? 
Ogami?! You're so mean! 
…Ogami? Ogami?! 
What is it, Sakura? 
Oh, thank goodness. I thought you might've left already. 
It's all right, Sakura. If anything happens, I'll be there in an instant. 
Anyway, it's late. You should head to bed. 
OK… 
Ogami… Thank you for worrying about me. 
Talking to you has helped me calm down a little. 
Really? That's good. 
Sorry for bothering you during your night watch. 
I'll… try to brave the thunder. 
…I see. 
Right, I should get going. Good night, Sakura. 
OK… Good night, Ogami. 
Yes…? 
It's me… So, what next? 
I've managed to calm down, for the most part. 
I'm still scared, but I'll manage. 
You've got this, Sakura. 
… 
(Is Sakura mad at me?) 
(Oh well, better move on.) 
It's just like Sakura to have a cute nameplate like this. 
OK, let's check another room. 
I wonder if Iris is in her room.
…Who is it? 
It's me, Ogami. You still awake? 
Mon Frère… 
You haven't even changed into your pajamas. What's wrong? 
I feel nervous for some reason. My heart won't stop pounding. 
Almost like… Reni's going to leave us. 
Like she's going somewhere far away. 
Iris… 
I'm going to Reni's room! I'm worried about her! 
H-Hey, Iris! 
Reniiii… Are you in there? 
Reni! Answer me, Reni! 
Iris… 
Hm? Hold on a second. The door's open… 
…OK, Iris, let’s go inside.
…Right.
So Iris's nameplate is shaped like Jean-Paul. 
OK, I'll check another room. 
Ah, there you are, Ogami. 
Kaede? What are you doing here this late? 
You haven't seen Saki Kageyama around, have you, Ogami? 
Huh? Saki? No, can't say that I have. 
What's wrong, Kaede? You usually never address Saki by her full name like that…
I'll explain later. Sorry, I have to go, I'm in a hurry. 
Kaede looked really on edge. I wonder what's wrong. 
Kaede? Are you in there? 
I better check another room, I guess. 
No answer. Guess there's no one in there. 
In which case, where could Kaede be? 
Ah, Mon Frère… 
Iris?! What are you doing up this late?! 
I feel nervous for some reason. My heart won't stop pounding. 
Almost like… Reni's going to leave us. 
It feels like she's going somewhere far away. 
I see. OK, let's go talk to Reni. 
That's weird. She's not in her room at this hour. 
Mon Frère… 
Hm? The door's open. 
…OK, Iris, let’s go inside.
…Right. 
Maria? Are you there? 
Who is it? 
It's Ogami. 
Oh, Captain. Good work with the night watch. 
Sorry to bother you so late. You weren't asleep, were you? 
It's all right. I was just reading. 
Nothing's out of the ordinary in here. 
I see. OK then, good night. 
Keep up the good work, Captain. 
(Maria's reading in there. I probably shouldn't call out to her.) 
It's Maria's nameplate. 
OK, time to check another room. 
I wonder if Kanna is in her room. 
Zzz… No, I couldn't eat another bite… 
Huh, guess she's already asleep. 
No answer. Did she go somewhere? 
Kanna's… Well, I guess it's more of a nametag than a nameplate. 
OK, let's check another room. 
I wonder if Sumire is in her room.
Zzz… Zzz… 
Sounds like she's already fast asleep. 
Sumire's already asleep. I should leave her be. 
This is a pretty subtle design, considering it's Sumire. 
Let's check another room. 
I wonder if Kohran is in her room. 
No answer… 
A gear-shaped nameplate, huh? It's just Kohran's style. 
Let's check another room. 
I wonder if Orihime is in her room.
Yeeees? Who is it? 
It's Ogami, I'm here on my night watch. 
You're a pretty hard worker, Mr. Ensign. 
I'm all right. I was just enjoying the typhoon's melody. 
The rhythm and tempo are simply wonderful. I'd love to play it on the piano sometime. 
Hahaha. The typhoon's no match for you, Orihime. 
All right, I have to go. Good night, Orihime. 
Good luck with your evening stroll. 
She'll get mad at me if I keep bugging her. I should leave her be. 
The nameplate has a simple design, but it sure looks classy. 
Let's go check another room. 
Autumn nights are long, and yet I still don't feel like reading on days like this. 
I should go, there's nothing out of the ordinary here. 
No one's here, just the sound of wind and rain. 
Nothing unusual here. I should keep moving. 
It's too early to end my patrol yet. 
I can't get a signal in this storm, either. I should go somewhere else. 
Figures nobody would be here this late at night. 
I should get going. There's nothing unusual here anyway. 
Stepping out on the terrace right now would just get me soaked. 
Seems like the door's shut tight. OK, moving on, then. 
You can hear the howling of the wind all the way here. 
Nothing unusual. I should get going. 
Day or night, this place never changes much. 
Everything seems normal here. OK, where to next? 
Whoa… That was some intense lightning. 
The storm’s become a lot more violent since nightfall.
Huh? Looks like someone's in the bathroom. 
Those clothes, and that headband… Those must be Kanna's. 
Which would mean… Kanna's the one inside, right? 
I am drawn to the bath…
Go back outside. 
O-Oh no… My body is moving towards the bathroom on its own… 
(K-Kanna…) 
(Hmmm, I can't see that well through all this steam…) 
(C-Crap!) 
Huh? Who's there?! 
Be upfront. 
Run away. 
Be upfront. 
Hey, Kanna, how's the water in there? 
B-Boss?! 
You dumbass! Don't look at me! 
K-Kanna… 
Shut up! Just get the hell out of here! 
Y-Yes, ma'am! 
(I gotta get out of here before she sees me!) 
Stop right there! Boss, is that you?! 
(C-Crap! I can't believe she already spotted me!) 
Peepin’ on me in the bath and trying to sneak away… That's real low, Boss! 
I-I'm sorry! I'll be leaving now!! 
Whoa! Is… <br> Is that you, Boss?! 
(Crap! No use in running now!) 
Wh-What the hell are you doin’ just standin’ there?! 
I, uh… I didn't know what to do, so… 
Just get the hell out of here! 
Yes, ma'am! Right away, ma'am! 
… 
I'm sorry, Kanna. I just sorta found my way in there, and… 
You walked in fully aware, you didn't just "find your way in there." 
Y-You're right. I really am sorry. 
Well, I'm not gonna chew ya out for this one… 
But I'm a woman, too, y'know. Ya gotta be more considerate. 
Kanna… 
All right, I'm gonna get goin’. Quit peepin’ during your night watch, all right? 
Hmm… That went about as poorly as I expected. 
But it's true, Kanna is a woman, after all. 
(I have to get out of here before Kanna sees me!) 
Phew… Looks like she didn't notice me. 
I can't be peeping in the baths like this. This is enough as it is. 
Phew! Welp, time to get out. 
(Oh crap!! It looks like she's leaving the bathroom!) 
(I gotta get out of here before she sees me!) 
Phew, I think I got away before she realized I was there. 
If I was even a second too late, I would be in big trouble. 
Yo, Boss! Lookin' to take a bath? 
No, I'm in the middle of my night watch. 
I see. Thanks for working so hard this late. 
I just got out of the bath, myself. Nothin’ unusual to report in there. 
Welp, good luck with your patrol. Night, Boss. 
Right then, I should get back to my rounds. 
Kanna already left, and there's nobody else in here. 
Nothing out of the ordinary here. I should get going. 
Oh, if it ain't the chief. 
Oh, Kohran. Maintaining the Koubu as usual, I see. 
Spirit Armors are something else, I tell ya. 
The man who built the original Koubu units was none other than Shinnosuke Yamazaki himself. 
It's true that he did some unforgivable things… 
But he really was a bonafide technological genius. 
I see… 
For real, though, Spirit Armors are the invention of the century, to say nothing of their power. 
You could even say they're "armor"-zing! Get it? Ahahahaha! 
Ahahahaha! 
Oh, a wise guy, eh? 
Ahahahaha! 
Ahahaha! Nice one, Kohran. That was pretty funny. 
Really? You mean it? Heheh, glad you think so. 
…Ahahaha! Nice one, Kohran. That was pretty funny. 
Hmm, it took ya minute to chuckle at that one. 
You weren't forcing that laughter just now, were you? 
N-No, of course not. 
Really? You don't have to laugh if you don't wanna. I hate lies, remember? 
Oh, a wise guy, eh? 
…I was, uh, trying to do the straight man routine, there. 
Ahahaha! Not bad, Chief! 
You're a proper straight man, now! You've improved a lot! 
Y-You think so? 
Oh, oh jeez… <br> Not funny, huh? Sorry. 
N-No, I just didn't know how to respond. 
Well, you don't have to laugh if you don't find it funny. Maybe try following it up instead. 
It's kinda lonely when only one of us is cracking jokes, y'know? 
I-I see. I'll remember that for next time. 
Well, that's enough for today, I'm calling it here. 
All right. I gotta clean up, Chief, so I'll see ya later. 
Yeah, good work today. 
Right, I should get back to my rounds. 
Oh, if it ain't the chief. 
Kohran? Staying up late to maintain the Koubu, I see? 
Yep, I was so caught up in my work, I totally lost track of the time. 
Man, time just slips away when you're in the zone. 
It's too late for this. 
Don't overdo it. 
I appreciate the hard work, but it's too late for this. 
S-Sorry. I guess I kinda went overboard. 
Glad to see you taking your night watch seriously, Chief. Nice going. 
Well, I am the captain, it's all part of the job. 
All right. I gotta clean up, Chief, so I'll see ya later. 
Yeah, good work today. 
Right, I should get back to my rounds. 
Don't overdo it, OK? We wouldn't want you to catch a cold or something. 
No need to worry, I'm all done anyway. 
All right, I gotta clean up, Chief, so I'll see ya later. 
Yeah, good work today. 
Right, I should get back to my rounds. 
Well, that's enough for today, I'm calling it here. 
All right. I gotta clean up, Chief, so I'll see ya later. 
Yeah, good work today. 
Right, I should get back to my rounds. 
Oh, Chief. It's gonna take me a bit longer to clean up. 
I see. Don't stay up too late, though. 
Yeah, I know. All right, good luck on your night watch, Chief. 
All right, I should get back to it. 
G-Good evening. 
Oh my, Ogami! What are you doing here so late? 
Uh, I'm here on my night watch. 
Well, thank you for your hard work. We were just in the middle of today’s debriefing meeting. 
Debriefing? 
We reflect on our makeup and speech from the past day and give constructive feedback to each other. 
Doing this daily is what helps us enhance our beauty! 
I know! You should join us. How does that sound, Kikunojo? 
Um… Ah… I'm so embarrassed… 
Why not, Kiku? I think it's a great idea! 
C'mon, Ichiro, come chat with us about your beauty! 
I-I'm in the middle of my patrol, so I have to go! 
Ah, Ichiro! 
Good grief… Holding a meeting like that in the dead of night… 
That room is truly terrifying… 
Oh, Ogami! So you've decided to join our meeting after all? 
EEEEK! <br> Ichiro! I'm so happy! 
N-Nope, just checking in! I have to go! 
Ah, Ichiro! 
Wh-Why do I keep going in there…? 
Anyway, I should get back to my rounds. 
It's a total mess in here, as usual. 
Nothing out of the ordinary, though. I should check somewhere else. 
The training room… Nobody's here at the moment. 
Well, nothing unusual here. Onto the next stop. 
It's so quiet here, as though there wasn't even a storm outside at all. 
Nobody's here. I'll go check another room. 
Smells nice in here, like soap. Kanna was in here not too long ago, right? 
I'd love to take a bath myself, but I'm on duty right now. 
It's just like a hospital at nighttime in here. Gives me the creeps. 
Nothing out of the ordinary here. I should get going. 
Nobody's here, and everything seems normal. Better get going. 
The steam processor works nonstop, day and night. 
Totally unmoved by whatever racket's going on outside. 
Flower Division, all hands reporting for duty… Aside from Reni. 
In all likelihood, the one who kidnapped Reni was… Saki Kageyama.
She's also the sniper that shot Manager Yoneda, and is most likely a member of the Black Demons.
Huh?! No… Saki?! 
So she was the spy all along, then?! 
Knowing that, all of the Black Demon Society's moves up till now start to make sense. 
The arson at Fukagawa, the surprise attack during our vacation… 
They couldn't have done any of that if they weren't being fed information. 
So the one who shot Yoneda, and the one who just kidnapped Reni… It was Saki this whole time?! 
I can't believe Saki was actually a spy… 
Dammit! Those Black Demons fight dirty! 
We have to hurry and go after Reni. 
But first, is there anything you wanted to ask me, Ogami? 
Why did Saki take Reni? 
How did you get this info?
Why did Saki take Reni? 
I think it might have something to do with Reni's past. 
Sometime during the Great War, a group of German scientists were conducting special research.
The name of this project… was "Wachstum." 
A project with the aim of creating soldiers wielding perfect, enhanced spirit power. 
In the end, the project only saw a single survivor. That survivor… was Reni. 
As a part of "Wachstum," Reni had only one purpose: to become an elite fighting machine. 
All this to say, Reni grew up deprived of human contact and affection. 
Reni was taught nothing but how to fight during what were her most emotionally vulnerable years. 
I can't even begin to imagine just how lonely Reni must have felt… 
After the war ended, they managed to rescue Reni… but it was already too late. 
Reni's heart was frozen shut, cold as ice… 
Reni… 
Where did you get the intel on Saki? 
I asked a certain someone to investigate the matter. 
A certain someone? Who's that? 
…Sorry, but I can't tell you yet. 
Kaede… 
Right then. Everyone, let's split up and look for Reni. 
It's stormy out, so everyone form groups of two. 
Yes, ma'am! 
I'm coming with you, Mon Frère! 
I'm bringing Reni those flowers no matter what! 
All right, I understand. 
I'll be deploying with Iris. If any of you finds Reni, let us all know at once! 
Roger! 
All right, Ogami, give the order to move out! 
Assault Troupe, move out!
We will save Reni! 
Imperial Assault Troupe, move out! 
Roger! 
We'll save Reni… 
No matter what it takes! 
All right, let's show 'em what the Flower Division is made of! 
I actually don't mind fighting in the middle of a typhoon. 
All right, let's go, everyone! 
Wait for us, Reni! We're coming to save you! 
Everyone, we WILL save Reni! 
Sir, yes, sir! 
Keep it together, Ogami! You're the captain, remember?! 
Now give the order! 
Reni! Where are you? Answer me! 
Reniiii! Reeeeeniiii! <br> Where are you?! 
Iris, can you use your powers to find out where Reni is? 
OK, I'll try. 
… 
Reni, where are you? If you can hear me, please answer! 
…!! <br> Reni! 
What's wrong, Iris? 
Mon Frère, I can feel a super strong power coming from over there! 
Got it! Let's check it out! 
It'll be daybreak soon. Where are you, Reni?! 
Ah!! Mon Frère! Over there! 
Reni! Reni, are you all right?! 
… 
Reni… 
Heheheheheh. <br> Her heart is already mine. 
Reni's my cute little puppet now. She'll make a great gift for our master. 
A souvenir of the return of Saki Kageyama; of Suiko, one of the Black Demon Society's Five Elements. 
Saki. I didn't want to believe you were truly Suiko. 
But if you really are the same Saki who was our friend, you'll stop this right now! 
It's not too late! Give Reni back, and return to the Saki you used to be! 
Heheheh. Naive as ever. 
Reni. Those two are your enemies. Now kill them. 
…RO-GER. 
Heheheh. Well, Ogami? What will you do? 
Rrgh… How could you?! 
Mon Frère… What… <br> What should I do? 
Go get the others. 
Come with me. 
Iris, go get the others! 
OK, got it! 
Mon Frère, please save Reni! 
I will. I'll talk to her. 
Reni asked me what it is I'm fighting for. 
I know my answer now. Just hold on, Reni! 
Come with me, Iris. I'll need your help, too 
OK, got it! 
Let's save Reni, Mon Frère! 
If you talk to her, I'm sure she'll come around! 
Reni asked me what it is I'm fighting for. 
I know my answer now. Just hold on, Reni!
