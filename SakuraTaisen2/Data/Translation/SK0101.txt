Looks nice outside considering that storm last night. The cherry blossoms are no worse for wear. 
Thanks to that, today's sake is extra delicious, don’t you think, Ogami? 
Yes, sir. I'm just glad to see you're in good health, General Yoneda. 
Damn straight I am! <br> I see you're still as uptight as ever, though. 
Anyway, it's been a whole year since we last saw each other, so here's a toast to our reunion. Drink up! 
Yes, sir! 
…Oh ho, I see. <br> A naval exercise off the coast of South America? Good work. 
It'd been so long since I'd trained at sea. It really put me through the wringer. 
Good, good. <br> By the way, Ogami, how's the capital look after being away for so long? 
Well, it appears to be as lively as ever. Everything looks so peaceful. 
Peace, huh. It's an easy word to say, but a delicate thing. Fragile as a sugar sculpture… 
Listen, Ogami… 
I called you here today for one reason and one reason alone. We need you back in the troupe. 
But sir, I'm still assigned to the Imperial Navy. 
I have your transfer papers right here, signed by the Minister of the Navy and General Staff Headquarters. 
Ensign Ichiro Ogami! For your new mission, you are hereby appointed command of the following unit:
Imperial Assault Troupe, Anti-Demon Defense Corps: Flower Division! 
I'm putting you back to work, Ogami. 
I'll give it my all! 
I'm looking forward to it. 
I'm punching tickets again?
Understood, sir! I, Ichiro Ogami, will give it my all! Until my very last breath! 
All right, hold your horses, Ogami. 
If you start out this fired-up, you'll end up burning the candle at both ends, you know. 
I look forward to it. I can't wait to start things fresh as captain of the troupe. 
Heheh, there you go getting all formal again. 
…So basically, I'm back to being a ticket puncher, aren't I? 
Ya got that right. The Flower Division's captain has to be a ticket puncher. It's tradition. 
I dunno whether to be happy or sad about this… 
Snap out of it, Ogami! What're you spacing out for?! 
Ah… A-Apologies, sir! <br> I was just taken aback… 
Sheesh, you're just like you were a year ago. You haven't changed a bit. 
…By the way, Ogami, there's something I want to ask you before you resume your position as captain. 
Is there anyone in the Flower Division you have strong feelings for? 
Yes, there is. 
Not particularly. 
No, not particularly. 
Yes, there is. 
I see. All right then, who in the squad left the biggest impression on you? 
W-Well… 
It's Sakura. 
It's Sumire. 
It's Maria. 
What's wrong? Don't be shy, tell me. 
It's Kanna. 
It's Iris. 
It's Kohran. 
It's Sakura. 
I see. Sakura, eh? 
That's right, you did chase after her train that one time… 
Y-Yeah… 
I see. It's already been a whole year since then, huh. 
So how is Sakura doing, anyway? 
She was overjoyed when she heard you were coming back. You've been separated for a long time, after all. 
Ogamiiii! 
W-Was that voice...? <br> It couldn't be! 
S-Sakura!! 
When I told her you were coming back, she said she absolutely had to be here for it. 
All right now, get going. She's been waiting a long time for this, you know. 
Y-Yes, sir! 
Sakura… 
Ogami… 
Sakura… Long time no see. 
Ogami… Um… I… 
… 
Heehee, sorry. 
I had so much I wanted to say when I finally got to see you. 
But now that I look at your face, the words are all gone. 
Sakura… 
I'm back. 
I missed you. 
I'm back, Sakura. 
…Welcome back, Ogami. 
Now we can be together again. I'm so happy. 
Sakura… 
Sakura, I've missed you. 
Ogami… 
The first time we met, the cherry blossoms were also in full bloom, weren’t they? 
Yes, they were. 
That was… <br> Two years ago, I think. 
… 
S-Sorry. I, well… I just can't find the words. 
How about we just… start with hello. 
R-Right. We haven't even properly greeted each other yet. 
Welcome back, Ogami. I look forward to working with you again. 
Likewise. Let's both do our best as members of the Flower Division. 
OK, looks like the touching reunion's over and done with. 
Yes, sir. Getting to see Ogami again is like a dream come true. 
Well, that's all well and good, for now. 
I don't mean to rain on your long-awaited parade, but there's something I need to tell you two. 
The Flower Division is a combat unit that fights demons to protect the peace of the capital. 
You'll have to put your lives on the line when you're fighting out there. 
I understand how happy you two feel right now, but you'll need to keep your feelings in check. 
Y-Yes, sir… 
Keeping the peace isn't an easy job. You need to be ready for anything at any given moment. 
That way, we never have to repeat… the tragedy of losing those we hold dear. 
General Yoneda… 
You two can be friendly with each other, I don't mind. I just wanted to make things clear. 
Yes, sir. Understood. 
Oops, it's about that time. Sakura, take Ogami to the theater, if you'd please. 
Understood. Well then, Ogami, let's head over to the Grand Imperial Theater. 
Yes. It's Sumire. 
I see. Sumire, eh? 
That's right. You went to that party of hers, dressed to the nines. 
Y-Yeah… 
I see. It's already been a whole year since then, huh. 
So… How is Sumire doing, anyway? 
She seemed quite happy to hear you were coming back. 
She even told me she'd come here specially to meet you. 
Huh? Th-Then that means… 
Yup, and it's just about that time, too. 
S-Sumire! 
What a touching reunion. Well, it's been a while. You two take your time. 
Y-Yes, sir! 
Sumire… 
It's been ages, Ensign. 
I'm back, Sumire. You seem to be doing well. 
Oh, enough with the frivolities, Ensign. 
Don't you have a more appropriate greeting for me? 
(More appropriate?) 
You're even more beautiful. 
I've been dying to see you. 
Thank you for coming…
Sumire, you've grown even more beautiful. 
Oh my, not bad. Stating the obvious won't get you far, though. 
No, I, uh… I was trying to tell you my honest feelings. 
Ohohoho. <br> Straightforward as ever, I see, Ensign. 
You, too, have grown more handsome since last we met. 
Th-Thanks. 
Sumire, I've been dying to see you again. 
G-Goodness, Ensign… 
You've gotten quite… bold since last we met. 
W-Well, not that I mind, but… 
Perhaps you should rein it in somewhat. 
R-Right. Sorry. 
Thank you for coming, your attendance is greatly appreciated. 
What are you on about, Ensign? What do you think this is, a wedding? 
No, I just… When you asked if there was a more appropriate greeting, I thought maybe… 
Ohohohoho! <br> I see your sense of humor is as lively as ever, Ensign. 
I yield, Ensign. You truly are different from other men. 
… 
…Ensign? Is something the matter? You're so quiet. 
S-Sorry. I was just trying to think of something to say. 
But, I truly am happy to see you again, Sumire. I mean it. 
Indeed. Words don't suffice for something like this. 
I know how you feel, Ensign. Thank you. 
OK, looks like the touching reunion's over and done with. 
Excuse me, sir, but we were having a moment! Could you refrain from spoiling it? 
Wahahaha! <br> Sorry, sorry, wasn’t trying to tease you. 
I don't mean to rain on your long-awaited parade, but there's something I need to tell you two. 
The Flower Division is a combat unit that fights demons to protect the peace of the capital… 
You'll have to put your lives on the line when you're fighting out there. 
I understand how happy you two feel right now, but you'll need to keep your feelings in check. 
F-Feelings, you say? S-Since when have I had such feelings for the ensign? 
Come on, Sumire, listen to me. This is serious. 
… 
Keeping the peace isn't an easy job. You need to be ready for anything at any given moment. 
That way, we never have to repeat… the tragedy of losing those we hold dear. 
General Yoneda… 
You two can be friendly with each other, I don't mind. I just wanted to make things clear. 
Besides, Sumire, you two won't be seeing each other for a little while. 
I know it's hard, but it's times like this that you need to keep your emotions under control. 
… 
“Won't be seeing each other"? What do you mean, General? 
You'll have to ask Sumire yourself later. 
Now then, Sumire, if you could escort Ogami to the Grand Imperial Theater. 
…Of course. Understood, sir. 
Yes. Maria. 
I see. Maria, eh? 
That's right. You two went to Russia together. 
Y-Yes. We took a special holiday. 
I see. It's already been a whole year since then, huh. 
So, how is Maria doing, anyway? 
Maria's accompanying Count Hanakoji on a business trip to America. She's headed to New York. 
I see… So I won't get to see her, then. 
That is, she was supposed to be headed there, but she told me she just had to see you. 
She delayed her departure just so she could be here. 
Huh?! Th-Then that means… 
Yep. Looks like it's about that time. 
M-Maria!! 
What a touching reunion. Well, it's been a while. You two take your time. 
Yes, sir! 
Maria… 
Captain… <br> It's been a long time. 
Maria, have you been well? 
Yes. I'm relieved to see you're doing well, too. 
I look forward to having you as our captain again. 
Likewise. 
Gonna be a fresh start.
Likewise. I'm happy to be back in the Flower Division again. 
So am I. It's an honor to be working with you again, Captain. 
Let's work together to keep the capital safe. 
Yeah, it’s gonna be a fresh start. 
At any rate, it's my first time back in over a year. I'll need to keep my wits about me. 
Haha, it's all right. I know you'll be able to bring the Flower Division together. 
Let's both do what we can to keep the capital safe. 
Hmm? What's wrong, Captain? 
Oh, sorry. It's just… There's so much I want to say. 
Indeed. 
Whenever I try to put my thoughts into words, it all falls apart. 
But I'm glad I could see your face one more time before I have to leave. 
Maria… 
OK, looks like the touching reunion's over and done with. 
But boy, leave it to Maria to make it so serious. 
Y-Yes, well… 
Hey, that's just who you are. No need to be embarrassed. 
I don't mean to rain on your long-awaited parade, but there's something I need to tell you two. 
The Flower Division is a combat unit that fights demons to protect the peace of the capital. 
You'll have to put your lives on the line when you're fighting out there. 
I understand how happy you two feel right now, but you'll need to keep your feelings in check. 
…Yes, sir. 
Keeping the peace isn't an easy job. You need to be ready for anything at any given moment. 
That way, we never have to repeat… the tragedy of losing those we hold dear.  
General Yoneda… 
… 
Maria already knows, so I'll leave it at that. 
I know you won't see each other again for a while, but don't let that get in the way of your work. 
Understood. It's just as you say, sir. 
Glad to hear it. Now then, Maria, if you could escort Ogami to the Grand Imperial Theater. 
Yes, sir. Once I escort the captain, I'll be headed straight for New York. I'll be back come July. 
Got it, see you then. Have a safe trip. 
Yes, sir. You take care of yourself as well, sir. 
Yes. Kanna. 
I see. Kanna, eh? 
That's right. You two went to Okinawa together. 
Y-Yeah… 
I see. It's already been a whole year since then, huh. 
So, how is Kanna doing, anyway? 
Kanna's back in Okinawa for karate training. 
I see. So I won't get to see her, then. 
That is, she was supposed to be headed there, but she told me she just had to see you. 
She delayed her departure just so she could be here. 
Huh?! Th-Then that means… 
Yep. Looks like it's about that time. 
Heeeeey, Boss! 
K-Kanna!! 
What a touching reunion. Well, it's been a while. You two take your time. 
Yes, sir! 
Kanna… 
Yo, Boss! Long time no see! 
Kanna, you’re as fired up as ever. 
Heheh! My energy's my strong suit. 
Y'know, Boss, I've gotten way better at karate over the past year. 
How 'bout it? Let's have a sparrin’ match! 
Let's go a round! 
H-Hold on a sec! 
All right, let's go a round! I've gotten stronger myself, too! 
Heheh, there’s the Boss I know! Straight to the point. OK, here I come!! 
Whoa, hey, what are you two trying to pull in a place like this? 
Oh, whoops. Totally forgot you were there. 
Heheh, still, I'm glad I could see you before I head off. 
H-Hold on a sec! Are we seriously gonna spar in a place like this? 
Ahahaha! Relax, I'll go easy on you. 
R-Really? Still, if worse comes to worst… 
I mean, I don't think the others would forgive me if I wrecked you. Hahaha! 
Anyway, we’ll all be countin’ on ya, Boss! 
… 
Ah, my bad. Challengin’ you to a fight right off the bat is kinda weird, huh? 
…Sorry, Boss. I'm not good at this kinda stuff. 
I'm glad I get to see you, but I have no idea what to say. 
I understand. It's OK. That's just how you are. 
Heh, you think so? Thanks, Boss. 
OK, looks like the touching reunion's over and done with. 
And a very fitting one, coming from you two.
Heheh, I guess. “Reunion” makes it sound more dramatic than it is. 
Yeah, I'm not a fan of that sentimental stuff, either. 
I don't mean to rain on your long-awaited parade, but there's something I need to tell you two. 
The Flower Division is a combat unit that fights demons to protect the peace of the capital. 
You'll have to put your lives on the line when you're fighting out there. 
I understand how happy you two feel right now, but you'll need to keep your feelings in check. 
Whoa, whoa, whoa! <br> Since when do Boss and I have feelings for each other? 
Keeping the peace isn't an easy job. You need to be ready for anything at any given moment. 
That way, we never have to repeat… the tragedy of losing those we hold dear.  
General Yoneda… 
… 
You two can be friendly with each other, I don't mind. I just wanted to make things clear. 
I know you won't see each other again for a while, but don't let that get in the way of your work. 
… Yeah, I got it. It's important to set boundaries. 
So we're clear, then. Now, Kanna, if you could escort Ogami to the Grand Imperial Theater. 
Got it, leave it to me. Oh yeah, sir? 
Once I drop him off, I'm headed straight to Okinawa. 
I see. Take care, Kanna. 
You too, sir. All right, let's go, Boss. 
Yes, Iris. 
…Iris? 
Now that you mention it, you two went to France together. 
Y-Yeah. We took a special holiday… 
I see. It's been a year since you last saw her. 
So how is Iris doing? 
She was overjoyed when she heard you were coming back. You've been separated for a long time, after all. 
Mon Frèreee! 
W-Was that voice...? <br> It couldn't be! 
Ah, Mon Frère! <br> Over here, over here! 
I-Iris?! What's she doing here?! 
When I told her you were coming back, she said she absolutely had to be here for it. 
All right now, get going. She's been waiting a long time for this, you know. 
Y-Yes, sir! 
Iris… 
Mon Frère… 
Heehee, Mon Frère! <br> It really is you! 
Have you been doing well? 
Yeah, of course. Looks like you've been doing well, too. 
Uh-huh! Jean-Paul also came to see you! 
Is that so? Thanks. 
… 
Hey, Mon Frère… 
Hm? 
Don't leave again. OK? 
I don't want to be left behind anymore… 
Iris… 
Mon Frère, you promise you won't leave me alone anymore. Right? 
I promise. 
I can't promise that. 
I promise. I won't abandon you ever again. 
Really? 
Yes, really. 
Really, really? 
Really, really. 
Thanks, Mon Frère. It's a promise! 
Yes, it's a promise. 
Sorry, but I can't promise that. 
Huh?! Why not?! 
I'd have to leave the moment I get orders to return to the Navy. 
I don't want to lie to you, Iris, so that's why I can't make that promise. 
Mon Frère… 
… 
You understand, right, Iris? 
I love that you're honest, Mon Frère. I'm sorry for being so selfish. 
Iris… 
But it's OK, now we're together again! 
Haha, that's right. Now that I'm back at the theater, we can be together. 
Uh-huh! 
… 
Sorry. I just got transferred, so I can't say one way or the other yet. 
But we'll be together for now, at least. Is that OK? 
Yeah… OK. That's fine. 
You're back, and that's all that matters. 
Thanks, Iris. 
OK, looks like the touching reunion's over and done with. 
Uh-huh! Thank you, Uncle Yoneda! 
Now, now. No need to thank me. 
I don't mean to rain on your long-awaited parade, but there's something I need to tell you two. 
The Flower Division is a combat unit that fights demons to protect the peace of the capital. 
You'll have to put your lives on the line when you're fighting out there. 
I understand how happy you two feel right now, but you'll need to keep your feelings in check. 
…I don't understand a single thing you're saying! 
Hrm… Basically, don't act too lovey-dovey. 
No! 
Noooo way! I'm Mon Frère's girlfriend! 
I won't stop loving him! 
BLEHHH!! 
H-Hey! Iris! 
Bahahaha! There's no helping you, is there, Iris? 
Well, I guess I can make an exception. Ogami doting on you isn't anything new, after all. 
Yaaay! Isn't that great, Mon Frère? He said we can be lovers! 
…Y-Yeah. 
Oops, looks like it's that time. Iris, if you could escort Ogami to the theater for me. 
You know the way there, right? 
Don't worry! I'm old enough to know that! 
OK then, Mon Frère, follow me! C'mon, hurry! 
Yeah, yeah… 
Yes. Kohran. 
I see. Kohran, eh? 
That's right. You two went to China together. 
R-Right. 
I see. It's been a year since you last saw her. 
So how is Kohran doing, anyway? 
Kohran's currently stationed at the Hanayashiki Branch. 
You remember Hanayashiki, don't you? They design and manufacture the troupe's weapons over there. 
She's not ready to become head of Hanayashiki just yet, but she seems really popular over there. 
And she's been keeping up their morale since they haven't had any leadership for over a year. 
I see. So I won't get to see her when I get back to the theater… 
That is, she was supposed to be headed there, but she told me she just had to see you. 
She's heading over here to greet you. 
Huh?! Th-Then that means… 
Yep. Looks like it's about that time. 
Ogamiiii! 
K-Kohran!! 
What a touching reunion. Well, it's been a while. You two take your time. 
Yes, sir! 
Kohran… 
Ahaha! It really IS you, Chief! This isn't a dream after all! 
Kohran, you look good. 
You're looking plenty manlier yourself, Chief! 
You… You think so? 
So you just got back from the Navy, huh? 
To be totally honest, I was hoping I could give you a big welcome with a new invention of mine. 
This was all so sudden, I didn't have time to get anything ready. Sorry about that. 
Kohran… 
Seeing you is enough. 
Show it to me sometime.
Don't worry about it. Just being able to see you is more than enough. 
Th-That's real bold of you to say. 
Chief. Are you really OK with just this? 
I'm gonna be at Hanayashiki, so we won't be able to see each other for a while, y'know? 
We've been apart for a year already. What's a little longer? 
Besides, you're coming back to the Flower Division eventually, right? 
O-Of course I am! Once my work's all wrapped up, I'll be right there! 
I see. Well, that's too bad. You'll have to show me your invention sometime. 
Yeah! Sure! I'll have it all ready for next time! 
Look forward to it, OK? 
… 
Wh-What's wrong, Chief? You're spacing out… 
N-Nothing. I was just trying to imagine what kind of invention you had ready for me. 
Like, what it would've done to me… 
Heyyy, what's that supposed to mean? 
OK, looks like the touching reunion's over and done with. 
Thanks a bunch for calling me over at Hanayashiki, Yoneda. 
Now, now. No need to thank me. 
I don't mean to rain on your long-awaited parade, but there's something I need to tell you two. 
The Flower Division is a combat unit that fights demons to protect the peace of the capital… 
You'll have to put your lives on the line when you're fighting out there. 
I understand how happy you two feel right now, but you'll need to keep your feelings in check. 
Wh-What are you talking about? What's that supposed to mean? 
Keeping the peace isn't an easy job. You need to be ready for anything at any given moment. 
That way, we never have to repeat… the tragedy of losing those we hold dear.  
General Yoneda… 
You two can be friendly with each other, I don't mind. I just wanted to make things clear. 
I know you won't see each other again for a while, but don't let that get in the way of your work. 
… 
Don't worry, Yoneda, I got it. 
Glad to hear it. Now, Kohran, if you could escort Ogami to the Grand Imperial Theater. 
Alrighty, roger that! <br> C'mon, Chief, let's go. 
Oh yeah, Yoneda, I'll be heading straight back to Hanayashiki after this, so please excuse me. 
Got it. Tell the guys at Hanayashiki I said hi. 
Thanks a bunch, Yoneda! I'll be back as soon as I can! See ya! 
What?! "Not particularly"? Did you forget about everyone in the Flower Division? 
Oh well, I suppose it has been a year. 
We can't have you getting lost on your way back to the theater, though, so I brought you a guide. 
Ogamiiii! 
S-Sakura!! 
When I told her you were coming back, she said she absolutely had to be here for it. 
All right now, get going. She's been waiting a long time for this, you know. 
Y-Yes, sir! 
Ogami! I've waited so long for you to come back! 
Sakura Shinguji, Imperial Assault Troupe Flower Division, reporting for duty once again! 
I look forward to working with you! 
Likewise. I'm eager to start things fresh. 
I'll leave escorting him to the theater to you, Sakura. 
Yes, sir. Understood. 
By the way, Ogami, do you remember where the Grand Imperial Theater is? 
It's in Asakusa. 
It's in Ginza. 
It's in Sendai. 
It's in Asakusa, right? 
Nope. The Grand Imperial Theater is in Ginza, remember? 
Our munitions factory, the Hanayashiki Branch, is over in Asakusa. 
O-Oh. Is that so… 
It's in Ginza, right? 
Yes, that's right. At the intersection on Fourth Street, right in the heart of Ginza. 
It's in Sendai, right? 
Oh, come on, Ogami! That's completely wrong! 
The Grand Imperial Theater is in Ginza. 
I'm from Sendai. 
Huh… Is that right? 
Heehee. You've always been such a kidder, Ogami. 
Um… Uhhh… 
Ogami, did you seriously forget? 
The Grand Imperial Theater is in Ginza. 
Try to remember from now on. You're the captain of the Flower Division, after all. 
Oops, it's about that time. Sakura, if you'd be so kind as to escort Ogami to the theater? 
Understood. Well then, Ogami, let's head over to the Grand Imperial Theater. 
You'd never be able to guess that the Grand Imperial Theater, right in the heart of Ginza… 
…is actually the headquarters of the Imperial Assault Troupe. 
All right, Ogami, we're here. 
All right, Ogami, we're here. 
All right, Ensign, we've arrived. 
All right, Captain, we're here. 
OK, Boss, we're here. 
Heheh, we're here, Mon Frère! 
All right, Chief, we're here. 
(The Grand Imperial Theater, the Imperial Assault Troupe's Ginza Headquarters.) 
(I'm back. At long last, I'm back at the Imperial Theater.) 
Um, Ogami? 
What is it, Sakura? 
You know how the manager just told us to "keep our feelings in check," right? 
It's like he said. While we work as stage performers as part of the troupe… 
We also have to put our lives on the line to defend the capital from harm. 
We can't afford to get distracted like that. 
Sakura… 
So I'm going to restrain myself, just like the manager told us to. 
Just… know that none of that changes how I feel about you, Ogami. 
Sakura… 
Thank you. 
I… can't. 
Thank you. 
I… can't. 
I feel the same way. 
Thank you. That means a lot to me. 
Let's both do our best, as fellow members of the Flower Division. 
OK! 
I… can't. 
Huh? 
We just got back together. I don't want to have to bottle up my feelings for you again… 
O-Ogami, don't be so unreasonable… 
You'll worry me, and all the others, too. 
Sakura… 
We need to be able to rely on you as captain of the Flower Division. 
I'm sorry. You're right. I shouldn't be talking like that as your captain. 
Let's both do our best, as fellow members of the Flower Division. 
OK! 
I feel the same way. 
… 
Thank you, it means a lot to me to hear you say that. 
I'm sorry. I can't think of what to say. 
But I know how you feel, Sakura. Thank you. 
No, that's all right. It was so sudden of me… I'm sorry. 
All right then, Ogami, let's head inside. 
Oh, that's right! I have something I need to take care of, you go on ahead. 
What is it? 
Heehee, it's a secret. We'll have a nice long chat later, OK? 
What was that all about? Now I'm curious. 
Oh well, might as well head inside. As of today, I'll be working at the Imperial Theater once again. 
Ensign… 
What is it, Sumire? 
Ensign, doesn't this bother you? 
What does? 
Ugh! You're as oblivious as ever, Ensign! 
You know, what the manager told us earlier! 
Oh. About romantic feelings, right? 
On stage or in battle, sure, but he wants to control how we act in private, too? 
N-Now, now… 
Now nothing! What do you think of all this, Ensign? 
I agree with him. 
Nothing we can do about it. 
I agree with him. 
Nothing we can do about it. 
I don't agree either. 
It was awfully sudden, but I agree with him. 
… 
I'm the captain of the Flower Division. I can't be giving special treatment to any of my subordinates. 
But I'm not going to deny my feelings for you, either. 
So… What if we just got along the way we used to? 
Well, if that's what you think, Ensign, then so be it. 
All right then, let's head inside. 
There's not much we can do about it. He's got a point. 
Do you really think so? Are you just giving up, then? 
W-Well I'd be lying if I said I was happy about that. 
To be honest, I don't agree with him either. 
I knew it, you feel the same as I do. 
Does he not trust me? 
… 
Ensign, you're gravely mistaken. 
He deeply values your capabilities as captain of the Flower Division. 
Sumire… 
Sorry. To be honest, I don't really know myself. 
It's all so sudden, I'm still trying to process it. 
I think I know just how you feel, Ensign. 
…Huh? 
The love we fostered shall never be extinguished… 
And anyone who gets in the way of our romance can get trampled to death by horses for all I care! 
Ohhhhohoho! 
Ha… Haha… <br> W-Well, in any case, let's just carry on like we used to. 
Understood, Ensign. 
All right then, Sumire, how about we head inside now? 
… 
Actually, Ensign, I'm afraid this is where we must part. 
Part? But why?! We just got back together! 
The truth is, I just received news that my grandfather has fallen ill. 
What? Is he all right? 
I don't know. All anyone will tell me is I have to go back to my family's estate. 
I see. 
Ensign, I must go now. 
But be sure to take care of the Flower Division, each and every one of them. 
I'm sure they'll all be worried sick without the theater's top star at their side. 
Yeah, that's true. Leave everything here to me. 
Give your grandfather my regards. I'm looking forward to your return. 
Thank you. Well then, Ensign, take care. 
Sumire… 
…Captain. 
What is it, Maria? 
I'm sure General Yoneda told you already… 
But I'll soon be departing to accompany Count Hanakoji on his trip to America. 
Right… I finally get to see you after all this time only for us to separate again.
It's only for three months. We'll see each other again soon. 
As of today, you're the captain of the Flower Division once again. 
So please, think about the others rather than worry about me. 
Leave it to me. 
I feel nervous. 
Leave it to me. 
I feel nervous. 
…Please, don't go. 
Leave it to me. I'll keep a close eye on them while you're out. 
Good! Thank you. 
Maria, come back as soon as you can, OK? 
OK. I'll be back the moment my assignment is over. 
To be honest, I feel kind of nervous not having you here. 
Captain, you can't be saying things like that. 
Y-You're right. I'm sorry. 
Still, I'd feel a lot better with you by my side. 
Maria, please come back soon. 
Of course. I'll be back the moment my assignment is over. 
Maria, please don't go. 
… 
I'm finally back, I finally get to see you, and now we have to separate again… 
Pull yourself together! You're the captain of the Flower Division, aren't you?! 
Huh?! 
As captain, everyone in the Flower Division trusts you with their lives. 
What good would it do them for you to wallow in your self-pity like this? 
… 
I'm happy you feel that way, I really am… 
But please, think harder about what the manager told us. 
Maria… 
… 
Don't look so down, Captain. I'll be back by July. 
You're right. Just take care of yourself, OK? 
I will. Thank you. 
It seems the tram is here. Right then, I have to get going. 
I'll see you again soon, Captain. Look after the others for me. 
Take care…  
I will. Well then, goodbye. 
Maria… 
Hey, Boss? 
What's up, Kanna? 
It's about time for me to head out. 
Ah, right, you're heading over to Okinawa. 
Heh, karate's all I got, y'know. 
I've been doin’ nothin’ but acting this past year, I'm startin’ to get rusty. 
I'll train a ton in Okinawa. I'm gonna get way stronger, and then I'll come right back. 
I see… 
Good luck! 
Why do you have to train? 
Let's spar when you return.  
Why do you have to train? 
All right, I understand. I'm sure you have a good reason. 
Good luck over there, Kanna. I'll be waiting. 
Heh, thanks, Boss. 
I gotta say, you've become a hell of a guy. 
I don't even have to say a thing and you totally get me. 
Ah, it's no big deal. 
Kanna. Why do you have to go train? 
Hmmm, figures you wouldn't understand. 
Long story short, I can't settle for how strong I currently am. 
Kanna… 
All right then, let's spar once you get back! 
Oh? You sure, Boss? You might get hurt! 
Haha, don't forget, I'm a soldier! 
Don't think I'll go down easy, even with all your training! 
Haha! Lookin' forward to it! Be sure to work out a ton while I'm gone! 
… 
C'mon, Boss, I can't leave on a high note if you're lookin’ at me like that. 
S-Sorry, I just couldn't think of what to say. 
I don't have any cool quips or anything, but… I'll be waiting for you, Kanna. 
Yeah, there we go! That's the spirit! This ain't goodbye forever! 
Ah, there's my ride. I gotta go. See ya, Boss. 
Take care. Look after the others for me! 
Yeah, take care of yourself too, Kanna! 
I know, I know! I'll get even stronger and come right on back! 
Later, Boss! 
Kanna… 
Hey, Mon Frère? 
What is it, Iris? 
Heheh, we're together again. I get to be with you again! 
Hahaha, that's right, Iris. 
Hey, Mon Frère. Don't you think I've changed? 
…You have? 
You're even prettier now. 
…You have? 
You're even prettier now.
You're more grown-up now. 
…You have? 
C'mon, Mon Frère! <br> It's been so long since we last saw each other! 
You're supposed to say that I'm prettier, or more grown-up, or something! 
I-I see. I'm sorry. 
You're just the same as always. You just don't understand a lady's heart at all! 
R-Right. 
You're right. You're even prettier now than you used to be. 
Hee hee hee, really? <br>Yaaay! I'm so happy! 
Um, but Mon Frère, did you notice anything else? 
Huh? Did something else happen? 
Yep! I'm 11 years old now. 
Don't you think I'm more grown-up now? 
Y-Yeah. 
You're right. You're more grown-up now. 
Really? So you did notice! I knew you would, Mon Frère! 
I'm 11 years old now. I'm a real adult now, huh? 
Hahaha, that you are. 
Hee hee… <br> Thank you, Mon Frère. 
Mon Frère, why won't you say something?! 
Uh… S-Sorry. You asked me so suddenly. 
Sheesh, you're so dense! 
Sorry, Iris. 
C'mon, Mon Frère, let's go inside! 
Right. I wonder how the others are doing. 
Um, so right now, it's just me and Sakura here. 
Huh?! Where are the others? 
Sumire went home to her family because her grandpa fell ill. She's there now. 
Kanna went to Okinawa to train… 
Maria has work to do in New York… 
…and Kohran is also working at the Hanayashiki Branch. 
I see. So I won't get to see everyone, huh? 
But it's OK, 'cause everyone will be back by this summer!  
Besides, now that you're here, I won't be so lonely anymore. 
Is that so? I’m glad to hear that, Iris.
Oh, that's right! I have to go get ready now. 
Later, Mon Frère, I'll be going now! Bye-bye!! 
Hey, Iris! <br> And she's gone. 
But I wonder what she's getting ready for. Now I'm curious. 
Chief? 
What's up, Kohran? 
It's about time I headed back to the Hanayashiki Branch. 
That's right, you were transferred over there… 
Yup! I'm smack dab in the middle of a secret project! 
I'll be back in the summer, so just hang tight, Chief. 
I'm looking forward to it. 
I can't wait. 
I'm looking forward to it. 
I can't wait. 
What "secret project"? 
I'm looking forward to your return to the theater once you're done with your work. 
Thanks a bunch, Chief. You saying that makes my work feel worth it. 
I see. Honestly though, I can't wait. 
I finally get to see you again, but now you have to go… 
Ch-Chief, I'm flattered, but… 
We both have important jobs to do to keep a whole lot of people safe. 
I'll be working super hard to make sure that happens. 
So let's both get our heads in the game, Chief! 
All right, got it. Let's both do our best, even while we're apart! 
Roger that! I'll be back at the theater in the summer, so hang tight! 
Hang on. What's this about a "secret project"? 
Heheh! I can't say a word, not even to you, Chief! 
Well, a secret project at Hanayashiki can only mean one thing, right? 
You'll just have to wait until summer. Look forward to it! 
What, you don't care about my job, is that it, Chief? 
N-No… That's not it at all. 
… 
Ahahahaha! Relax, Chief, I'm just kidding. 
I'll be right back once I'm done with all my work, so rest easy. 
Heh, of course, I'd rather get back to the Flower Division as soon as possible, though. 
Like I told Yoneda, I'll be back as soon as I'm all done. 
…Ah, shoot! It's already time. I gotta head back. 
Want me to walk you to the bus stop, Kohran? 
Nah, don't worry about me. I came here on my steam bike, just in case. 
All right, Chief, I'm heading back to Hanayashiki now. 
Good luck, Kohran. I'm looking forward to your "secret project." 
Thanks a bunch… <br> Oh, right, I almost forgot. 
I left a present for you in your room, try not to forget about it! 
A… present? 
Yep, one of my inventions. It's real handy, too, so take good care of it! 
All right, Chief, see you in the summer! 
Yeah. Take care, Kohran. 
OK, later! 
Kohran… 
We're here, Ogami. The Imperial Assault Troupe's headquarters: the Grand Imperial Theater. 
We normally work as stage performers, as part of the "Imperial Assault Troupe." 
But when enemies appear, we deploy as a combat unit also known as the "Imperial Assault Troop." 
We'll be counting on you from now on. 
Leave it to me. 
I'll do what I can for now. 
Leave it to me. 
I'll do what I can for now. 
I feel kinda nervous… 
Leave it to me. Everyone in the Flower Division can count on me. 
Thank you so much! You truly are dependable, Ogami. 
I'm still not used to being back yet, so I'll just do what I can for now. 
Of course. Take all the time you need. 
I don't know if I can do this, I feel kinda nervous. 
You'll be fine, Ogami! Have some faith! 
… 
Ogami? What's wrong? 
N-Nothing, I was just trying to think of an answer. 
Heehee, you have nothing to worry about, Ogami. You'll be fine. 
All right, then, let's head inside. 
Ah, but first, there's something I need to take care of, so you go on ahead. 
What is it? 
Heehee, it's a secret. We'll have a nice long chat later, OK? 
What was that all about? Now I'm curious. 
All right, then, time to head inside. This is my workplace from now on. 
Sorry Ogami, but customers are only allowed to purchase one of each bromide. 
I see. That's too bad. 
So sorry, Mr. Ogami, but customers are only allowed to purchase one of each bromide.
Oh, really? That's too bad.
