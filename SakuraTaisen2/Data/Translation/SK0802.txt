Uh… 
What’s with that racket? It’s too early for this…
…! 
Gunshots?! 
Jump out of bed. 
This is no time to be sleeping!
I need to hurry! <br> Where is everyone?! 
Nothing seems to be out of the ordinary, but… 
I knew it, that's gunfire! It's coming from the first floor! 
Ogami! 
That voice… 
Ogami! Are you all right?! 
Sakura! What the hell is going on?!
… 
Acting in haste could be dangerous… Let's wait and see what happens…
…! 
Ogami! Ogami, wake up! 
S-Sakura?! 
Ogami, please open up! Quick!! 
Got it! I’ll be right there!! 
Sakura, what in the world is going on?!
I don't know… I rushed over here as soon as I heard those gunshots. 
What about the others?! 
They went down to the first floor with Kaede. 
I see… 
There should be people on the second floor! Sweep the area!! 
…! 
Ogami! Someone's coming! 
Let’s get out of here.
Assess the situation.
Let’s get out of here, Sakura! We need to regroup with the others as soon as possible!
Right!
Wait… If we're not careful, we could put ourselves in even more danger.
We’ll still have time to escape once we’ve gotten a look at who we’re dealing with.
Right, understood. 
S-Sakura, what do we do?! 
Ogami! What are you saying?! 
If you don’t get your act together, we’re all gonna be in trouble!!
B-But… 
Let's run, Ogami. I think the first thing we should do is meet up with everyone else.
…! 
Over there! I see her!
Ah! 
It’s her, Sakura Shinguji! Open fire!!
You missed! <br> Continue firing! 
This is bad! Run, Sakura! 
R-Right! 
Major Amakasa, we've managed to occupy the lobby, dining hall, and seating area! 
We're currently taking over the second floor as well. The operation has been going smoothly! 
Don't get careless. Our efforts will be meaningless if we don't occupy the entire theater. 
Yes, sir! 
Our first objective is to capture the backbone of the Assault Troupe, their underground command room!
Yes, sir! <br> The basement squad's operation is going smoothly as well. 
Second, we must fulfill our special mission from His Excellency. Capture Sakura Shinguji, dead or alive!
Yes, sir! 
The time for the Army has finally come, to rule this rotten Japan. 
Your Excellency… <br> Before long… <br> Our restoration will be realized!
We managed to escape from the second floor. 
Ogami, those people just now… They were wearing Army uniforms.
Why… Why is the Army attacking the theater?!
Hmm… 
…! <br> Ogami, Sakura!! <br> There you are! 
Mr. Yoneda! 
I’m glad to see you both are safe.
You too, Manager… Thank goodness you're all right! 
Mr. Yoneda… 
What on earth is happening?
What about everyone else? 
What on earth is happening?
I’m just as much in the dark as you two, but… I have a hunch.
What about the rest of the Flower Division? Where is everybody else?
…I dunno. I just caught up with you two.
But I'm sure they're all doing fine. 
Everyone… 
… 
… 
Ogami, pull yourself together! Don't just space out in the middle of a crisis!
Y-Yes, sir!
I’m sure you've already noticed, but the people raiding the theater are wearing Army uniforms.
It’s very likely… that the military is attempting a coup d’etat.
A coup d'etat?! 
Occupying primary government institutions in order to seize their power…
In a nutshell, these people are trying to take over the country. 
There's no doubt that they've already attacked various places in the city, just like the theater. 
I-It can’t be! 
…Ogami, Sakura. I’m giving you both an order.
The two of you need to escape… Get out of the theater.
Huh?! 
No, we can’t do that!
What about everyone else?! 
You want us to run away by ourselves? There’s no way we could do that!
You idiot! Now isn’t the time to argue!
C-Commander… 
What about everyone else in the theater? Not to mention you, Commander!
If all of us were to flee at once, the Army would take over the theater.
This is a vital point of Tokyo's defense. We can’t afford to let it fall into their hands!
Commander… 
… 
I know how you feel, Ogami, but this is something only you can do. 
Now listen carefully. These orders are of the utmost importance. The survival of Tokyo is at stake.
Y-Yes, sir!
First, secure the Pandemonium Regalia. <br> You can find it in the underground storeroom. 
Then, board the Thunderstrike and escape to the Hanayashiki Branch. 
Finally, and this is the most crucial…
The enemy is after Sakura. Protect her with your life.
The Pandemonium Regalia? 
Why go to Hanayashiki? 
Why Sakura? 
…The Pandemonium Regalia? 
Japan's ultimate ceremonial instruments: the sword, jewel, and mirror…
All together they make up the Pandemonium Regalia.
If a righteous person has all three, they will wield the power of good.
But if a wicked person obtains them, they will wield an evil power that is just as strong.
Two years ago, Yamazaki… Cerulean Satan stole the Regalia for his own ambitions.
We managed to recover them in the fierce battle that followed.
Now, they are currently being kept in the underground storeroom.
We absolutely cannot let these people get their hands on the Pandemonium Regalia.
I need you to secure the Regalia and escape to the Hanayashiki Branch at all cost. You got that, Ogami?
Why do we have to head to Hanayashiki? 
Because… There is someone waiting for you at the branch. 
Someone waiting for us? 
That’s all I can say. For the time being, just get aboard the Thunderstrike and escape to Hanayashiki.
Why are they targeting Sakura? 
…Sakura, listen well to what I’m about to say.
Members of the Shinguji family have the “Lineage of Purification” running through their veins.
That is to say… <br> They hold the “Power of Purification.”
Power of… Purification? 
With that power, we could seal away even the strongest of demons.
However, it would cost the life of the one who wields it… 
…! 
Seven years ago, during the Great Kouma War, there was a person who used that power. 
A man who sacrificed his life to seal away a mighty evil…
That man was your father… Kazuma Shinguji.
What?! It can’t be… <br> My father?! 
I’ve kept silent until now… But your very existence is a threat to those who wish to commit evil.
Get it, Ogami? Protect Sakura… No matter what! 
We can't allow Sakura to die because of that power!
Yes, sir! 
Find Sakura Shinguji! And once you do, don’t hesitate to open fire!
Hah! 
It's only a matter of time until those guys find us.
Go, Ogami! Head to the basement and escape to the Hanayashiki Branch, now! 
Run to the basement. 
Understood! <br> Watch yourself, Mr. Yoneda! 
Yeah, you can count on it! I won't die so easily! 
What are you waiting for, Ogami?! There's no time! 
But I… 
Don't worry about me and the others! 
Just go, Ogami! Every second counts! 
…Yes, sir! 
Let's go, Sakura! 
R-Right! 
I'm counting on you, Ogami! 
Please stay safe, Mr. Yoneda! 
Damn it! Why's the Army attackin' us?! 
We can’t even fight back in our Koubu ‘cause we’re stuck indoors…
What's more, it's awful that we've been separated from Ensign and the others.
Mon Frère… Sakura… <br> I hope they're OK… 
Don’t worry about Mr. Ensign, it’ll take more than this to put him down!
At any rate, this position is compromised. We won't be able to hold out much longer. 
What should we do, Maria? Things are only gonna get worse if we stick around much longer.
…We should begin to fall back, but stop the enemy’s advancement as much as possible.
(The intruders have us outmanned and outgunned.) 
(If this keeps up, it'll only be a matter of time before they occupy the entire theater.) 
Seems like the Army hasn't breached the basement yet. 
…! <br> That explosion just now… <br> It came from the storeroom! 
Let's hurry, Sakura! 
R-Right! 
W-What? 
Ah! O-Ogami! 
Ichirooo! Sakuraaa! <br> We've been waiting for you! 
Seems that these guys managed to infiltrate the basement by blowing up the wall from the outside. 
But their luck ran out the moment they encountered the secret unit of love and beauty, the Rose Division!
Y-You guys! 
We'll help you! 
Why are you doing this?
We'll help you fight them off! 
Ogami… We're glad to hear that, but… 
You both have a more important task! 
Why are you doing this?
Looks like… the time has finally come…
To tell you about our mission…
Ensign Ogami. We’ve been awaiting your arrival.
Waiting to give you what we’ve been guarding all this time… The Pandemonium Regalia. 
W-What did you say?!
Protecting Japan's ultimate sacred weapon stored beneath the Imperial Theater… 
The Pandemonium Regalia… 
That is our true mission… Our mission as the secret unit of love and beauty, the Rose Division!
Here, Ensign Ogami! <br> Take this!
Th-This is…
It’s a piece of the Regalia, the jewel! Take it and escape the theater!
The enemy won’t be able to use the Regalia’s power if even one of its pieces is missing.
Everyone… 
Now go! <br> There isn't any time! 
No need to worry about us, Ichiro! 
Ogami, Sakura… <br> Please, hurry to the Hanayashiki Branch! 
Understood! <br> Let's go, Sakura!! 
Y-Yes! 
Ogami… <br> What’s going to happen to us?!
I don't know… 
But right now, all we can do is take this piece of the Regalia to Hanayashiki as fast as we can!
For the sake of the Flower Division… For the sake of everyone…
… 
OK! The Thunderstrike is working! 
Let's go, Sakura! <br> We're getting out of the Imperial Theater! 
Major Amakasa, I have a report! 
Our men have completely occupied the first and second floor of the Imperial Theater! 
The basement team has succeeded in breaking through their walls. 
They entered the underground facility, but are meeting stiffer resistance than expected.
What about the Flower Division? 
They seem to have retreated deeper into the basement, barricading themselves in the command room.
Heh… We’ve finally got them cornered.
Send a message to His Excellency. Let him know that we’re just about done here.
Yes, sir! 
Sorry Ogami, but customers are only allowed to purchase one of each bromide. 
I see. That's too bad. 
So sorry, Mr. Ogami, but customers are only allowed to purchase one of each bromide.
Oh, really? That's too bad.
