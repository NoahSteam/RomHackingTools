Are you all right, Ogami?
This is such an important mission, I was hoping you would let me come with you…
How come you didn't take me along?
Well, you see…
You're so important to me…
I wanted you to lead them. 
Sakura, you're just so important to me…
I couldn't bear to let anything bad happen to you.
Ogami…
I should apologize. I was so sure you thought I'd just get in your way…
That isn't true at all. In fact, I wanted to ask you to lead the second squad.
All right.
I wanted to ask you to lead the second squad for me.
It'd be tough to focus on fighting unless I knew someone I could trust was guiding them.
O-Oh, I see. I'm sorry I asked. We both have an important job to do.
Sakura, please handle those enemies!
Right! Leave it to me!
Um, no reason in particular, I guess…
Wait, really?
I'm sorry, Sakura. It seems like I've just made things more uncomfortable…
No, it's all right. I'm the one who should apologize.
Well, I'll let you handle those enemies, Sakura.
Right! Leave it to me!
