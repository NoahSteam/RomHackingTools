Are you all right, Ogami?
This is such an important mission, I was hoping you would let me come with you…
How come you won't take me along?
Well, you see…
You're so important to me…
I want you to lead the second squad…
Sakura, you're just so important to me…
I couldn't bear to let anything bad happen to you.
Ogami…
I should apologize. I was so sure you thought I'd just get in your way…
That isn't true at all. In fact, I wanted to ask you to lead the second squad.
All right.
I wanted to ask you to lead the second squad for me.
It'll be tougher to focus on fighting without someone I can count on leading them.
O-Oh, I see. I'm sorry I asked. We both have an important job to do.
Sakura, please handle those enemies!
Right! Leave it to me!
Um, no reason in particular, I guess…
Wait, really?
I'm sorry, Sakura. It seems like I've just made things more uncomfortable…
No, it's all right. I'm the one who should apologize.
Well, I'll let you handle those enemies, Sakura.
Right! Leave it to me!
