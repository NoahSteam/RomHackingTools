Here we come, Kyogoku! <br> For the capital's future! <br> For everyone's future!
For all their sakes…
Sakura… <br> Lend me your strength!
Of course! We'll defeat Kyogoku by our own hands!
We'll show Kyogoku the Flower Division's justice!
Yeah… OK, let's go!
Sumire… <br> Lend me your strength!
Ohoho, but of course.
The time has come for us to show him our justice! Now, Ensign, let us go forth!
Yeah, let's go, Sumire!
Maria… <br> Lend me your strength!
Of course. You have my assistance, Captain.
Now then, let's go, sir! Let's show him our justice!
Yeah, let's go, Maria!
Kanna… <br> Lend me your strength!
Yeah, of course! It's the moment of truth 'n all!
Now let's show this creep what real justice looks like!
Yeah, let's go, Kanna!
Iris… <br> Lend me your strength!
OK! I'll always be with you, Mon Frère!
Let's go, Mon Frère! <br> Let's beat up this bad guy!
Yeah, let's go, Iris!
Kohran… <br> Lend me your strength!
You got it! Leave it to me!
Let's go, Chief! Let's teach Kyogoku what justice is really about!
Yeah, let's go, Kohran!
Orihime… <br> Lend me your strength!
Of course! I cannot stand this Kyogoku guy!
Let us go, Mr. Ensign! We will show him that justice is on our side!
Yeah, let's go, Orihime!
Reni… <br> Lend me your strength!
…Roger. If you wish, I will support you to the extent of my ability.
This city is where I met you and the others, it's special to me. I'll protect it no matter what!
Yeah, let's go, Reni!
For the capital, for everyone… And for my father!
I'll always be there by your side, Ensign!
In the name of the Imperial Assault Troupe's Flower Division, we won't let Kyogoku have his way!
Long as we're here, this Kyogoku guy's not gettin' his way!
Besides, I'm not letting a bad guy like him get away with this!
We're not gonna let anyone get away with trying to destroy the capital for their own ambitions!
Besides, I have just started liking this place! I will not let anyone destroy it!
We cannot abide by the justice Kyogoku speaks of. Besides…
We're taking you down, no matter what!
