It's gotten really cold outside. 
This year has been so long, yet it's also flown by so quickly. 
I remember this place being packed with guests over the last few seasons. 
And now we're going to have a one-night only Christmas performance. I hope it'll be packed again. 
Hello there, Ogami! Would you like to buy something? 
Buy a photo. 
Talk to Tsubaki. 
Leave. 
Could I buy a photo? 
Sorry, Ogami. I can only sell you one photo per month.
Please understand, we need to keep some for the other patrons. 
You'd like to buy a photo? Thank you very much! 
That's a photo of Sakura. 
Let's see... Sakura's photo, right? 
That'll be 50 sen. Thank you very much! 
That's a photo of Sumire. 
Let's see... Sumire's photo, right? 
That'll be 50 sen. Thank you very much! 
That's a photo of Maria. 
Let's see... Maria's photo, right? 
That'll be 50 sen. Thank you very much! 
That's a photo of Kanna. 
Let's see... Kanna's photo, right? 
That'll be 50 sen. Thank you very much! 
That's a photo of Iris. 
Let's see... Iris's photo, right? 
That'll be 50 sen. Thank you very much! 
That's a photo of Kohran. 
Let's see... Kohran's photo, right? 
That'll be 50 sen. Thank you very much! 
That's a photo of Orihime. 
Let's see... Orihime's photo, right? 
That'll be 50 sen. Thank you very much! 
That's Reni's photo. 
Let's see... Reni's photo, right? 
That'll be 50 sen. Thank you very much! 
Oh, so you're not going to buy any? 
This is the first time I've seen you working here in a few months, Tsubaki.
Yep! I was away from the theater for quite a while, but now I’m back.
When you went out of your way to contact me in Hokkaido…
It was really encouraging. Thank you so much!
Oh no, it was nothing.
Anyway, are you happy to be back at the gift shop?
Absolutely! I was only gone for a relatively short time but I really missed it!
When I got back and stood behind the gift shop counter for the first time in months…
My heart began to swell and I thought to myself, “I’m finally home.” 
Tsubaki... 
I'll never forget that feeling, I'm determined to work even harder now! 
I look forward to working with you again, Ogami!
Yeah, likewise. 
I heard that Tsubomi worked hard while I was away.
Yeah, although she was a bit clumsy. 
Oh, by the way, Tsubomi now works in the dining hall. 
When you have the time, be sure to say hi to her.
At first, when I received orders to go to Hokkaido, I felt really nervous... 
But, in the end, I had a great experience there. I'm glad that I went.
Well, I should be going. Keep up the good work. 
Thank you very much! Come back soon! 
Tsubaki is putting in her best effort. 
OK, I'm gonna do my best to punch tickets as well! 
Thank you very much! Come back and buy another photo next month! 
Tsubaki is putting in her best effort. 
OK, I'm gonna do my best to punch tickets as well! 
Ah, Mr. Ogami! Good afternoon! 
Tsu-Tsubomi?! What's with that outfit? 
Starting today, I'm working in the dining hall! 
After all, Tsubaki’s back to running the gift shop!
Being a waitress is so wonderful! I get to see the customers' smiling faces as I do my job!
I see. Good luck, Tsubomi. 
Yes! Thank you very much! 
...Huh? I think I smell something burning. 
Aaah! I left a pot on the stove! 
Hey Tsubomi! You’re going the wrong way! The kitchen is over here!
Aaah, I got all mixed up! Thank you very much! Please, excuse me!
Oh boy… She’s still her usual clumsy self.
Ah, Mr. Ogami! Good afternoon! 
Tsubomi... The theater is closed, do we still have guests? 
No, but that’s OK. This is a good chance for me to practice.
I’m planning to become the perfect waitress in time for our Christmas performance!
I see, that’s great. Good luck, then. 
Thanks! Please come again! 
Hahaha, Tsubomi sure is full of spirit.
I need to work hard at my ticket punching job as well.
No one's in the kitchen. 
Everyone must be at the stage right now. 
The theater is closed until Christmas, so this room is closed too. 
I hope we'll get a lot of guests come showtime. 
Oh, do you need something, Ogami? 
You're gonna listen to my gossip, right, Ogami? 
My, you came here like clockwork, Ogami. 
If you're interested in hearing more rumors, I'm all out. Sorry. 
I see... That's too bad. 
I'll have some more interesting tidbits for you another time, so look forward to it! 
Hello, Yuri, Kasumi. 
Oh, hello, Ogami. Is there something you need? 
I've got plenty of new, juicy gossip for you. Ask away! 
Listen to some rumors. 
I'll come back later. 
Keigo Kyogoku... To think that he would end his own life! 
Right… It was a surprising conclusion, for sure.
Still, who would have thought that he had a connection with the Black Demon Society? 
I was shocked too. No one would have guessed that the Army Minister led an evil organization like that. 
Guess it's like they say, truth is stranger than fiction. 
It's been a month since then and the Army has settled down. 
A new minister has been appointed, and Kyogoku's officers have been purged. 
I see… That's good.
Boy, it was really snowy back when that coup happened. 
I’ve heard that political turmoil has often occurred during snowfall throughout Japan’s history.
The revenge of the 47 ronin... The Sakuradamon Incident... All of them happened on snowy days. 
I see… Now that you mention it, I suppose that’s true.
Thank goodness last month's attempt ended before it spread too far. 
To think, Tsubaki went to Hokkaido to transport the Tenbu... 
Why wasn't I the one to go? We're both Wind Division. 
I wonder if she was chosen because, among the Wind Division, she has the least amount of experience.
Anyone would grow after a mission like that. 
Well, when you put it that way, you may be right.
Hmph. But still, she got to go to Hokkaido… I’m so jealous.
I was wondering, Ogami, what do you know about sailor suits? 
Ah, you mean the clothes seamen wear onboard ships. I wore one during my training.
What about them?
The thing is, sailor suits have gotten very popular as schoolgirl uniforms recently. 
Huh?! Is that true? 
It seems that a lot of private schools in Tokyo have already adopted them as their uniform. 
We might see the city overflowing with schoolgirls in sailor suits pretty soon. 
I see... You never know what's going to be the next trend. 
I heard that back when the coup happened, traffic in Tokyo was brought to a standstill. 
Yeah, that's right. The railroads were completely buried under snow. 
Tokyo has an unfortunate reputation for being weak against snow.
I suppose not much can be done about that. The city rarely gets heavy snowfall.
Ogami, have you ever heard of something called "television"? 
Television? 
Ah, you mean that system for sending moving pictures across electromagnetic waves. I read about it.
As I understand, the first test broadcast was successfully conducted in England…
According to the article, there will be broadcasting stations like we have with radios in the future.
Heh, is that so? Sounds just like Kohran's Cinematron.
Seems like Kohran's ahead of the curve compared to England. 
By the way, Nippon Railway has begun operating the "Yamanote Loop."
Ah, you mean the Yamanote railway line.
Now we can easily go to places that used to be hard to reach. It's really convenient. 
I heard that it was really crowded on the first day. 
Why don't you try riding the train, Ogami? 
You’re right. I’ll give it a try sometime.
If you're interested in hearing more rumors, I'm all out. Sorry. 
I see... That's too bad. 
I'll have some more interesting tidbits for you another time, so look forward to it! 
I'll be back. Good luck with the rest of your work. 
OK. Thanks for coming, Ogami. 
Let us know if you hear any juicy stories!
All right… Now, where should I go next? 
I wonder if Mr. Yoneda is in his office. 
I better check another room, I guess. 
It's Ogami. Mr. Yoneda, are you there? 
Oh, Ogami. Yeah, come on in. 
Right. Pardon me. 
Yo, Ogami. Need something? 
No, nothing in particular. What are you doing, sir? 
Me? I'm thinking about Kyogoku... 
Keigo Kyogoku... Just what was he trying to accomplish? 
What do you think, Ogami? 
To take over Japan? 
Something unknown…
To seize the Regalia? 
Do you think he wanted to take over Japan? 
Hmm… That’s likely, given that he was pushing militarism for such a long time.
But even so, to think he'd orchestrate a coup... 
That was such an extreme measure for someone that was usually so cautious.
... 
Perhaps he had other motives we simply don't know about. 
Mm-hmm. It's definitely a possibility. 
But, he's dead now. The truth may never be unveiled. 
... 
Could it be that he simply wanted to steal the Pandemonium Regalia?
But if that’s so, why would he leave the theater with only two of them?
Now that you mentioned it, you're right... 
If his intention was to prevent us from using the Regalia, then it makes sense. 
In other words, to prevent Sakura from using her Power of Purification. 
If that were so, then seizing only two of them was enough. 
I see... That may be possible. 
But, he's dead now. The truth may never be unveiled. 
... 
I can't think of a reason... 
I see… Now that he’s gone, it seems that the truth has died with him.
However, there’s just something about all this that doesn’t sit right with me.
I never knew him to be a man that would take his own life.
... 
Whoops, sorry to make you listen to my ramblings for so long. 
No need to worry about it, Ogami. Just put everything you got into the Christmas performance for now.
Right, understood. 
Kyogoku's objective, huh... 
I wonder, what is it he was trying to achieve…?
Ogami, mind leaving for a bit?
I’ve got a lot on my mind right now.
...Yes, sir. Understood. 
(Yoneda… He's really concerned about Kyogoku's actions.)
I thought they were doing some song rehearsals, but no one's here. 
I should just go to another room. 
Oh, Captain. 
Yo. Need something, Boss? 
Oh, Kanna, Reni. What are you doing in here? 
We’re writin’ down costume materials that need to be ordered for “The Miracle Bells.”
The outfits for both the Holy Mother and the angels are gonna require custom-made materials.
Uh-huh, I can’t wait to see them.
Hehe, me too. What kind of costumes do you think they'll be, Boss? 
Beautiful costumes. 
Flashy costumes. 
Men's costumes. 
I bet you guys are gonna wear beautiful costumes. 
Yeah. We’re gonna wear real pretty outfits that match the Christmas theme.
I bet you guys are gonna wear flashy costumes. 
Nah, we won't do that. If anything, they'll be pretty modest. 
If you two are gonna wear them, I bet they'll be men's costumes. 
Hey, hey. We're not the only ones who're gonna wear them, Boss. 
We're gonna be wearin’ beautiful women's costumes, you know. 
Oh, when you put it that way, guess that was a bit rude.
But, if you're looking at just us two, I can see why you'd think that. 
Come on, not you too Reni. Jeez…
So, what kind of costumes are you going to wear? 
I have no idea. What kind of costumes are you going to wear? 
Haha, it's a bit hard for you to tell, ain't it? 
We’ll be wearin’ the most beautiful costumes to go with the holiday. 
After discussing it with the group, we decided to go with outfits that give an image of purity.
Thing is, the main lead still hasn't been decided yet... 
I see... I wonder who it'll be. 
Well, that's... 
... 
Sorry, Boss. We're still in the middle of work here. 
Could you let us get back to our job, please? 
Right, sorry to disturb you. 
Later, Boss. 
Hmm. For some reason, when the lead role came up, they got all quiet. 
Anyway, I better head to another room so I won't get in their way. 
The total cost of materials for the angel costumes would be... 
Reni... Don't you get sleepy after working with your thinkin' cap on for so long? 
That won't be a problem as long as you stay focused. 
(Hahaha... Those two are working hard.) 
They're focused on their work, better not bother them. 
Now... Let's go somewhere else. 
Ah, Mon Frère! 
My... 
What're you two doing? 
Maria and the others are preparing for the show, so we're taking a rest. 
We're talking about birthdays right now! 
We're holding the Christmas performance on December 24th, but also…
Someone in the Flower Division has a birthday on the same day. Do you know who?
Sakura? 
Kohran? 
Iris? 
Sumire? 
Orihime? 
Reni? 
Let’s see… Is it Sakura?
Wrong answer! Sakura's birthday is July 28th! 
December 24th is Reni's birthday. 
Oh, is that so? 
Let’s see… Is it Kohran?
Wrong answer! Kohran's birthday is March 3rd! 
December 24th is Reni's birthday. 
Oh, is that so? 
Let’s see… Is it yours, Iris?
...Mon Frère! My birthday is July 5th!
O-Oh, that’s right… Sorry.
Ohohohoho… It appears you’ve completely forgotten Iris’s birthday, haven't you, Ensign?
Oooh, I hate you, Mon Frère! 
Bleeeh! 
(Oh boy, that went poorly.)
December 24th is Reni's birthday, Ensign. 
Oh, is that so? 
Let’s see... Is it yours, Sumire?
No, Ensign! Don’t tell me you’ve forgotten?!
My birthday is January 8th! 
O-Oh, that’s right… Sorry. 
Honestly… Forgetting my birthday, that's beyond rude.
December 24th is Reni's birthday, Mon Frère. 
Oh, is that so? 
Let’s see… Is it Orihime?
Wrong answer! Orihime's birthday is July 7th! 
December 24th is Reni's birthday. 
Oh, is that so? 
Let’s see… Is it Reni?
You got it! Way to go, Mon Frère! 
Hahaha. Well, it’s only natural for the captain to know everyone’s birthdays.
Time's up! Too bad, Mon Frère. 
December 24th is Reni's birthday, Ensign. 
Oh, is that so? 
What a coincidence, to think that her birthday is on the same day as the performance. 
Perhaps we should do something to celebrate her special day.
Let's do it! Let's throw a birthday party for Reni!
I see… That sounds like a great idea.
And don’t tell Reni, Mon Frère. It’ll be a surprise party, OK?
Hahaha... Got it. 
So the performance will be on the same day as Reni's birthday. 
It's looking like the 24th will be a very busy day. 
So, Sumire, what kind of birthday party should we have? 
We can hold it during the closing party, and... 
(Looks like they're talking about Reni's birthday party.) 
Better not interrupt them. 
Now... Where should I head next? 
Kohran, I want to measure the length right here. Can you help me? 
Oh, OK. Wait up, I'm coming. 
Hm? Those voices, it's Maria and Kohran. 
Looks like they're doing something on the stage. 
How many meters is there, Maria? 
5 meters and 45 centimeters. Or about 5 and a half meters. 
Those two are working hard... 
Looks like arranging sets on the stage is a tough job.
Huh? Look who it is.
Ah, Ogami! 
Are you preparing props for the play? 
Yes. We're inspecting the props and sets for "The Miracle Bells." 
We have three weeks until the performance. 
I see... It's December already, huh. 
Oh, right. Now that it's December, I just remembered something I wanted to ask. 
I heard that this month has another name in the old Japanese calendar. 
What's it called? 
It’s called “Shisou.”
It’s called “Shiwasu.”
It’s called “Shibashiri.”
It's called "Shisou." 
Oh… Shisou, huh? 
O-Ogami, you got it wrong! 
The 12th month of the old lunisolar calendar is called "Shiwasu."
Oh, so you lied, huh? Quit acting like you know things when you clearly don’t, Ensign.
I-Is that what it was? Whoops. 
It's called "Shiwasu." 
Oh... Shiwasu, huh? 
It's called "Shibashiri." 
Oh... Shibashiri, huh? 
O-Ogami, you got it wrong! 
The 12th month of the old lunisolar calendar is called "Shiwasu."
Oh, so you lied, huh? Quit acting like you know things when you clearly don’t, Ensign.
I-Is that what it was? Whoops. 
Uh... What was it called again? 
The 12th month of the old lunisolar calendar is called "Shiwasu."
Oh… Shiwasu, huh? 
That was nice. You and I both learned something new today, Ensign.
Ah, haha... You're right. 
It was said that the 12th month was the busiest time for schools. Even teachers were dashing around.
Which is why it's called "Shiwasu," or "dashing teachers." I wonder how true it really is. 
Well, this month we're also busy with the performance, so it must be true. 
Hehe, you do have a point. 
Well, let's return to our tasks now, Orihime.
All right, back to work.
I'm going now. Keep up the good work, guys. 
OK. Thanks for stopping by. 
December, huh... So much has happened this year... 
I hope that the Christmas performance will close out the year as a big success.
Sakura, this tree prop is broken. 
The tree prop is damaged... OK, thanks for letting me know. 
(Looks like those two are inspecting the stuff back there.) 
Better not interrupt them. 
Now then, where should I spend my time next? 
Maria, what do you think about moving this set a bit more towards the front? 
Good idea. With the proper lighting, that spot would work better. 
Great work, you two. 
Oh, Captain. 
Are you preparing the stage for "The Miracle Bells"? 
Yes. Just a little before we start rehearsal... 
Well, you could say that we're just doing a bit of prep work. Nothing final.
Hehe, right, Maria? 
Um... Heh, yeah. 
Why only prep work?
I can't wait. 
Why only prep work?
I can't wait. 
Are you hiding something? 
Why are you only doing prep work?
That’s because, you know, we have to wait for a certain someone to give us the final set directions.
Kohran... 
...Ah, oops. The rest is still a secret.
Captain, we still have some work to do, so... 
If you don't mind, could you please check on the others?
Yeah, that's a great idea! I think everyone else is either in the dressing or prop room.
Anyway, thank you for visiting, Captain.
I can’t help but feel like I just got kicked out.
Anyway, I guess I should go to another room. 
I can't wait to see what kind of set it will be. 
Ahaha! I’m also looking forward to it. What about you, Maria?
Heh, I feel the same.
Alrighty then, Maria. Let’s get back to work.
Well, Captain. I’m afraid we still have a lot to do.
Yeah, good luck. 
Everyone has been working really hard for the Christmas performance. 
I should practice my ticket collecting... 
Are you two hiding something? The way you're laughing is making me curious. 
Eh? Chief... You're pretty sharp.
Kohran. We can’t say anything yet, remember?
Captain, we still have some work to do, so... 
If you don't mind, could you please check on the others?
Yeah, that's a great idea! I think everyone else is either in the dressing or prop room.
I-Is that so? 
Indeed. So please, go visit them, Captain.
I can’t help but feel like I just got kicked out.
Anyway, I guess I should go to another room. 
...Alrighty then, Maria. Let’s get back to work.
...You're right. 
Captain, we still have some work to do, so... 
If you don't mind, could you please check on the others?
Yeah, you're right. OK then, keep at it, you two. 
Thanks, Chief! 
Thank you for visiting us, Captain.
Everyone has been working really hard for the Christmas performance. 
I should practice my ticket collecting... 
Maria... If we put that there, won't it make it harder for the audience to see? 
Hmm... It's a bit hard to say. 
... 
They're still working. I better not interrupt them. 
OK, let's check another room. 
The Christmas performance will be our final play for the year. 
“The Miracle Bells,” huh... I wonder what kind of play it will be. 
Arf, arf! 
Change value of dog flag.
Hey, Shiro. You're still energetic, even in this cold weather. 
Hey, Hanamaru. You're still energetic, even in this cold weather. 
Hey, Dai. You're still energetic, even in this cold weather. 
Hey, Torte. You're still energetic, even in this cold weather. 
Hey, Long. You're still energetic, even in this cold weather. 
Hey, Altair. You're still energetic, even in this cold weather. 
Hey, Hund. You're still energetic, even in this cold weather. 
Arf! 
By the way, I heard that you're sleeping in front of the salon's fireplace at night. 
Woof. 
Hahaha. Well, aren't you a smart boy. 
Be careful not to catch a cold. 
Arf, arf! 
Aw-wooo! 
Change value of dog flag.
Shiro is working hard to dig a hole. Is he burying bones or something? 
Hanamaru is working hard to dig a hole. Is he burying bones or something? 
Dai is working hard to dig a hole. Is he burying bones or something? 
Torte is working hard to dig a hole. Is he burying bones or something? 
Long is working hard to dig a hole. Is he burying bones or something? 
Altair is working hard to dig a hole. Is he burying bones or something? 
Hund is working hard to dig a hole. Is he burying bones or something? 
...! <br> Arf, arf, arf! 
Oh, you found me. I won't steal them. Don't worry. 
Arf, arf, arf! 
OK, OK. I'll stay away. Bye, Shiro. 
OK, OK. I'll stay away. Bye, Hanamaru. 
OK, OK. I'll stay away. Bye, Dai. 
OK, OK. I'll stay away. Bye, Torte. 
OK, OK. I'll stay away. Bye, Long. 
OK, OK. I'll stay away. Bye, Altair. 
OK, OK. I'll stay away. Bye, Hund. 
Ah! It’s already past 4:45! Where'd the time go?
I forgot I had an appointment with Kaede! 
I gotta hurry to her room. I hope she'll forgive me for being a little late. 
Yo, Ogami. 
That voice... Kayama? 
Exactly! It's been a while, Ogami. 
Kayama... Can't you just come in through the entrance hall? 
Come on, come on. It's fine. 
Being able to spend the end of the year like this with you, I sure am lucky. 
So many things have happened to us all, but I'd still call it a good year. 
I wonder what the next one will bring. 
There’s a proverb I know. "Speak of next year and the devils laugh.”
Don't worry about what the future might bring. Living for the present is what's more important. 
You're right. Thanks, Kayama. 
Now that's the Ogami I know. 
Later, Ogami. Adiós. 
And... Merry Christmas. 
Christmas is still pretty far away, you know. 
Ugh, it’s really cold... Winter came so suddenly. 
We've only got a few weeks left before the new year. 
It's empty. Nobody's here. 
Everyone said they were going to be around the stage. 
I hope these seats will be filled with guests when the Christmas play premieres. 
Well, it is a Flower Division performance. I think we'll be OK. 
I just talked with everyone in here earlier. 
I'm sure they're at the stage right now. 
No one's playing before the performance, just as I thought. 
I'm sure everyone's doing rehearsals on stage right now. 
Phew... Being in my own room is quite relaxing. 
Now, what should I do... 
Make a call. 
Maybe next time. 
I know, why don't I make a call? 
OK, who should I contact?
Good afternoon. It's time for Capital News. 
During the attempted coup d'etat, Tokyo was under the rebel force’s control.
The Imperial Assault Troop was found battling with the Black Demon Society at Ginza and Shinjuku. 
Additionally, the troop was seen piloting what appeared to be new Spirit Armor.
It's possible that they have developed a new model for capital defense. 
Today, the Nippon Railway company has opened the Yamanote Loop Line for business.
The new line connecting Kanda and Ueno has finished, which completes the full-circle railway. 
Passengers can now reach neighboring towns efficiently without having to transfer trains. 
The Cabinet has approved a new code bill for The Imperial Army in today's meeting. 
This bill is mainly supported by the conservative faction in the House of Peers. 
Meanwhile, due to the recent coup, many in the House desire an even stricter bill. 
The Imperial Diet is likely to remain in turmoil for some time. 
Finally, it's time for this week's weather forecast. 
December's come and winter is about to arrive in Tokyo in full force. 
A harsh cold is being predicted to continue for some time. 
There are only a few weeks left in the year, and so we wish all our listeners a happy New Year. 
That's it for Capital News, brought to you by the Capital Daily Report. 
This concludes today's broadcast. We hope you will tune in for tomorrow's program. 
A red shadow opposes the evildoers lurking in the darkness of the capital. His name is Masked Red! 
Masked Red, the boy wonder of justice! Today he continues his fight for peace in the capital! 
Serial Radio Drama Masked Red, Special Episode: The Seven Secrets of Masked Red, Last Chapter. 
Masked Red's Secrets, #5: What does Masked Red drive? 
His vehicle of choice is an all-purpose motorcycle called the Mach Red. 
Equipped with a special steam engine, it can go from Asakusa to Ginza in five minutes. 
Masked Red's Secrets, #6: Who are Masked Red's friends? 
His biggest supporters are Professor Yukawa, a brilliant scientist, and his daughter, Miss Masae. 
Professor Yukawa made all of Masked Red's equipment such as the Mach Red and his twin Colt 1911's. 
Miss Masae meanwhile is a kind girl who helps Masked Red with his injuries. 
Masked Red's Secrets, #7: Where does Masked Red come from? 
He comes out of nowhere and leaves in the blink of an eye. 
Whenever you're in trouble, just call out his name. He'll surely come to the rescue. 
It's his duty. Fight on, Masked Red! You're our hero, Masked Red! 
Well then, loyal followers, I hope we get the chance to meet again. Farewell. 
Go, Masked Red! Fight on, Masked Red! Till we meet again! 
Huh? Sounds like someone's approaching. 
Yes? Who is it? 
Uhm... Ogami, is this a good time? 
Oh, Kasumi. Just a minute. 
Hi, Kasumi. Do you need something? 
Well… If you have the time, do you think you could help me sort receipts later today?
You can come to the secretarial office at 5 o'clock. 
Sorting receipts, huh…
I'm sure you're busy. If it turns out you don't have time, that's fine. 
Well, excuse me for now. 
5 o'clock at the secretarial office. What to do? 
Huh? Sounds like someone's approaching. 
Who is it? 
It's Yuri. Ogami, can I ask for your help? 
Oh, Yuri. Just a minute? 
Yuri… What kind of help do you need?
I need some help switching out the posters over by the VIP entrance around 5 o’clock.
You can come if you have the time. It's all right if you're already too busy, though. 
(5 o'clock... Wasn't Kasumi also asking for help at that time?)
I'll leave it up to you, OK? Just come by if you’re available! 
Ah, Yuri! 
Oh boy... Both of them want my help at 5 o'clock. Talk about bad timing. 
Huh? Sounds like someone's approaching. 
Yes? 
It's Tsubaki. Can I ask you something, Ogami? 
Now it's Tsubaki, huh? 
Hi, Tsubaki. By any chance, are you here to ask for my help? 
Eehh?! How’d you know, Ogami?
I was planning to arrange some merchandise at 5 o'clock to prepare for the Christmas performance. 
I was thinking about asking you for help, if that’s all right with you, Ogami.
(Of all the times, even Tsubaki needs me at 5…)
I'm sure you're busy. So if it turns out you can’t make it, that's perfectly fine! 
I'm going back to the gift shop now, so please excuse me! 
Aah, Tsubaki! 
…What am I going to do? All three of them want my help at the same time.
First, I have an appointment with Kaede… So let’s focus on that for now.
Now... Where should I head next? 
Ah! It’s already past 4:45! Where'd the time go?
I forgot I had an appointment with Kaede! 
I gotta hurry to her room. I hope she'll forgive me for being a little late. 
Let's do this later. I still have other stuff to do. 
I wonder if Kaede's in her room right now? 
Let's come back a little bit later. 
Ah, it’s getting late. I better hurry to Kaede's room…
Oh, wait. I'm already here. 
I wonder what she wants to talk about, anyway.
Uh... It's Ogami. 
Oh, Ogami. You're rather early. 
I still haven't finished my tasks yet. Could you wait for me a little longer? 
I see. Understood. 
Looks like I came a bit earlier than I was supposed to. 
I think I'll go somewhere else to kill some time. 
Nobody's here, huh? Well, it's not like many people usually come here anyway. 
There's nothing I can do in here, so I better get going. 
Is anyone in the library…? 
No one’s around… I suppose everyone went to the stage.
I wonder if Reni is in her room.
She's not here... I guess she's at the stage. 
Reni... Still using notebook paper as a nameplate, I see. 
OK, let's check another room. 
I wonder if Sakura is in her room.
It's just like Sakura to have a cute nameplate like this. 
I better check another room, I guess. 
She's not here... I guess she's at the stage. 
I wonder if Kanna is in her room.
Kanna's nameplate... It looks more like a nametag to me. 
I better check another room, I guess. 
She's not here... I guess she's at the stage. 
I wonder if Orihime is in her room.
She's not here... I guess she's at the stage. 
The nameplate has a simple design, but it sure looks classy. 
Let's go check another room. 
I wonder if Maria is in her room.
It's Maria's nameplate. It has a simplistic design. 
I better check another room, I guess. 
She's not here... I guess she's at the stage. 
I wonder if Iris is in her room. 
So Iris's nameplate is shaped like Jean-Paul. 
Guess I'll go somewhere else. 
She's not here... I guess she's at the stage. 
I wonder if Kohran is in her room.
A gear-shaped nameplate, huh? It's just Kohran's style. 
I better check another room, I guess. 
She's not here... I guess she's at the stage. 
I wonder if Sumire is in her room.
This is a pretty subtle design, considering it's Sumire. 
I better check another room, I guess. 
She's not here... I guess she's at the stage. 
Ah! It’s already past 4:45! Where'd the time go?
I forgot I had an appointment with Kaede! 
I gotta hurry to her room. I hope she'll forgive me for being a little late. 
With the Black Demon Society gone, the Flower Division won't be deployed for a while. 
Seems that we can finish this year safe and sound. What a relief. 
This spirit radar was really useful when we were detecting the Pandemonium Regalia's whereabouts. 
There are only a handful of steam processors like this in Japan. We can always rely on it in a pinch.
Hmm... Guess no one's here. 
I probably shouldn't stick around here. 
I thought someone might be taking a bath right now, but I guess not. 
Oh well, I'll just go somewhere else. 
No one's in the dressing room. Looks like nobody's in the bathroom either. 
Well, I guess everyone must be at the stage now. 
This pool remains warm even during the winter. I can swim here year-round. 
I heard that it uses heat from an underground boiler. 
Looks like no one's in the training room. 
Guess everyone's gone to the stage... Nobody's around.
The wall that got blown up by the coup forces has already been repaired. 
I was surprised to see that the Rose Division was protecting the Regalia... 
Aaah, Ichiro! Welcome! 
Even though we have nothing to guard now that the Pandemonium Regalia is gone...
We’ve decided to stay here a bit longer and support you guys!
Ogami… I’m so happy… I can stay here with you…
R-Right... 
Anyway, there's one thing I'd like to ask you, Ensign Ogami... 
Deep down, do you harbor any regrets about destroying the Regalia?
I don’t have any regrets.
I do have some regrets. 
No, I don’t have any regrets.
We can protect Tokyo with our own strength, without relying on the power of the Regalia…
Even now, my mind hasn't changed. 
Wow! You're so cool, Ichiro! 
That's wonderful to hear, Ogami... 
We're relieved to hear that answer, Ensign Ogami... 
The truth is… I do have some regrets.
Did I get carried away and doom us all? 
No, I don't believe that to be the truth. 
The Pandemonium Regalia shouldn't exist... We all agreed on that. 
We believe that... you made the right decision... 
Uh... I don't really know. 
Ensign Ogami... Have some confidence in your actions. 
The Pandemonium Regalia shouldn't exist... We all agreed on that. 
We believe that... you made the right decision... 
Our mission is to protect the capital with our own strength…
We were so preoccupied with the Regalia’s power, that we forgot that simple fact.
Kotone... 
Our point is, we'll keep working together with you guys, for the sake of Tokyo! 
We'll always be in this room... So please visit us again. 
The Rose Division, the secret unit of love and beauty, look forward to seeing you again soon!
Uh-huh... OK. 
Oh boy... Looks like the Rose Division is going to be sticking around. 
Well, the more the merrier, I suppose. I guess it'll be fine.
Ah, Ichiro! You came back! 
W-Well... Somehow I ended up back here... 
To be honest with you, we can't return to the Imperial Army right now. 
The Army is still a mess after losing Kyogoku, right? 
And... we thought that our return would only make it worse, so... 
I-I see... I get what you mean. 
Which is why, we'll be in your care once again, Ensign Ogami. 
We wouldn't mind staying in the theater forever, if you're OK with it! 
Yokihiko... That's a wonderful idea! 
Uh... Uh-huh... Anyway, I need to get going. 
My, that's too bad. You can stay here as long as you want, you know.
Don't hesitate to drop by our room anytime.
Whew… Those guys are the same as they ever were.
They're right, though. If they returned to the Army, it would just cause a big mess. 
The Assault Troupe’s new Spirit Armor, the Tenbu…
Thanks to these, our combat capabilities have grown even stronger which is reassuring.
Ah! It’s already past 4:45! Where'd the time go?
I forgot I had an appointment with Kaede! 
I gotta hurry to her room. I hope she'll forgive me for being a little late. 
Uhm... Ogami... 
Hi, Kasumi. Do you need something? 
Well… If you have the time, do you think you could help me sort receipts later today?
You can come to the secretarial office at 5 o'clock. 
Sorting receipts, huh…
I'm sure you're busy. If it turns out you don't have time, that's fine. 
Well, excuse me for now. 
5 o'clock at the secretarial office. What to do? 
Ogamiiii. Wait up! 
Do you need something, Yuri? 
Ogami, can I ask you for a little help? 
A little help? 
Yeah. Around 5 o’clock, I’ll be switching out the posters over by the VIP entrance.
You can come if you have the time. It's all right if you're already too busy, though. 
(5 o'clock... Wasn't Kasumi asking for help at that time too?) 
I'll leave it up to you, OK? Just come by if you’re available
Ah, Yuri! 
Oh boy... Both of them want my help at 5 o'clock. Talk about bad timing.
Oh, right! Ogami, wait up. 
Tsubaki… Don’t tell me. Do you need help with something?
Ogamiii! 
Tsubaki… Don’t tell me. Do you need help with something?
Eehh?! How’d you know, Ogami?
I was planning to arrange some merchandise at 5 o'clock to prepare for the Christmas performance. 
I was thinking about asking you for help, if that’s all right with you, Ogami.
(Of all the times, even Tsubaki needs me at 5…)
I'm sure you're busy. So if it turns out you can’t make it, that's perfectly fine! 
I'm going back to the gift shop now, so please excuse me! 
Aah, Tsubaki! 
…What am I going to do? All three of them want my help at the same time.
Sorry, Ogami. I can only sell you one photo per month. 
I see. That's too bad. 
So sorry, Mr. Ogami, but each customer is only allowed to purchase one photo at a time.
Oh, really? That's too bad.
