Hey Boss, how 'bout we switch up our strategy for a little change of pace?
Might be nice to use one that'll really let me bust some heads.
Might be nice to use one that'll let us dig our heels in and fight.
What should we do, Boss?
Let's go with Fire!
Let's go with Mountain!
Let's keep it like this.
OK, let's go with the Fire strategy!
You got itºÅ Time to mow down some enemies!
OK, let's go with the Mountain strategy!
Right! This'll let us take our time pickin' em off!
No, let's just keep it like this.
If you think this is still the best strategy, then I'm with ya. Let's keep at it, Boss!
ÖNo. I think we should keep going with our current formation.
Then let's keep at it and see how it goes!
