Those were some brilliant orders. You truly are the only one fit to be the Flower Division captain!
Excellent results! No matter who it is we're up against, I know you'll never lose!
You've gotten quite good at this. Don't forget those techniques when you're in a real fight.
Those were some good moves. You seem to have gotten a handle on your own fighting style.
That was some decent fighting. Keep on striving for even better results.
Well, these results are about average. Some more efficient fighting should get you better results.
You're getting there. You seem to have a good grasp of the basics.
Seems you're still not putting in enough effort. Keep your eye on the enemy and you'll find an opening soon enough.
What awful results. You need to learn the abilities of each of your units.
With results like these, it's too risky to put you in live combat. You need to train more.

There's something different about you today, Ogami.
I did it!
It was all thanks to you, Ogami!
Ogami… I believe in you.
My time to shine has come, Ensign.
Please, do your best for me…
You mustn't overexert yourself…
Now, here I come!
Watch me, Ensign!
What would you do without me?
I-If this keeps up…
Ensign… I'm so glad.
You're the only one I know who can protect me, Ensign.
M-My body moved on its own, that's all.
How could I be so careless…?
I can't bear to… leave you behind, Ensign!
Splendid, Ensign.
My, Ensign, so gallant!
That was nothing.
Did you see that, Ensign?
Hm hm, what a trifle. <br> Isn't that right, Ensign?

Alrighty, let's give this a shot!
Just leave it to me, Chief!
I gotta try my hardest!
Th-This is bad…
Th-Thanks, Chief…
Jeez, if you keep doing that, I just might…
I'd be a mess without you around, Chief.
I can't keep this up…
Sorry, Chief.
Way to go, Chief!
Looking good, Chief!
Problem solved!
Look, Chief, I did it!
With our strength combined, we're unstoppable!
Show me what you've got, Mr. Ensign!
Let's wrap this up quickly and go home.
I think I might be in trouble!
This is fun!
All eyes on me, please!
I will be handling this on my own!
I'd kill for a shower!
Aha! Thank you, Mr. Ensign!
Don't overdo it, Mr. Ensign…
Sheesh, you're hopeless!
No more!
I can't keep going. Captain… I have to retreat.
Not bad!
Very cool, Mr. Ensign!
That was easy!
Heehee! Give me a big round of applause!
We're an unstoppable duo!
…Commencing operation.
Be careful, Captain.
…Danger.
Here I go!
Your orders, sir.
With my strength… I will defeat you.
Critical damage sustained…
…
…Thank you.
Captain… Keep it together…
Making a temporary retreat…
Captain… I leave the rest to you.
Target annihilation confirmed.
Well done, Captain.
Target eliminated.
Your next order, Captain.
This… is our power…!
Awright, here I go!
C'mon, try not to bore me.
The real fight starts now!
You're pretty good!
Interesting…
You OK, Suiko?
You'll burn brilliantly…
Prepare yourselves.
Ahahahahaha!
I'll burn you to a crisp!
You… pieces of trash…
I'll show you what I've got.
I'll be gentle.
Hm hm hm… I won't lose.
Not bad. Just as I expected, Assault Troupe.
Urgh… So strong…
Now it's my turn.
My calculations are flawless.
I-I won't let it end like this…
This, too, falls within my calculations.
Ngh… This wasn't part of my calculations…
I'll hunt you down!
I'll make this quick.
I'll squash you like a bug!
Don't think you've won…!
This isn't over yet!
I'll end this.
Here I come, Assault Troupe!
No, not yet!
You've improved…
Urgh… I'll have my revenge…
You shan't be forgiven…
Know thy sins…
Battle is always uncertain…
Love is dead…
Ngh… Not bad…
Don't touch me!
You haven't even begun to feel the grudge festering within this city…
In the end… I'll be the last one standing!
At this rate, I'll… Ngh!!
Don't get cocky, you hypocrites!
