You're hurting me, Ensign! You don't have to be so aggressive! 
I’m sorry, Orihime… But you’re coming with me, even if I have to take you by force. 
You have to talk to Mr. Ogata. 
Cut it out! I want nothing to do with that man!
You shouldn’t talk about your father that way, Orihime! 
It's because of him and your mother that you're even here, right? 
You should have an honest conversation with him. 
... 
All right, we're here. 
...Mr. Ogata. 
Hello there, Ogami... Ah! 
Orihime... 
... 
I'll be waiting over there, Orihime, so you two have a nice, long chat. 
... 
Orihime... 
Don't say my name so casually! You don't have the right! 
Ahh, Orihime, even the way you get angry reminds me of your mother... 
Quit messing with me!! 
You abandoned Mamma and I for 17 years! 
And NOW you want to act like my father? Don't you think about anyone but yourself?! 
...You're right, I have no right to call myself your father. 
But if nothing else, believe me when I say this... 
I've never stopped loving you or your mother... Carino. 
That's a lie! Your words mean nothing! 
I don't believe a single thing you're saying! 
Orihime... 
Not another word! I don't want to hear it! Why don't you just... disappear?! 
Wh-What was that?! 
Heheheh... How droll... 
It's you, Kasha! 
I can make that man disappear, young miss, just like you wanted. 
Of course, you'll disappear right alongside him... 
Urk... 
Ugh... Ori... hime... 
Hold on! 
Why? Why did you protect me?! 
Protecting his daughter... is what any father would do. 
Besides, Carino would... be furious with me... if I let you get hurt. 
Papa... 
Thank you, Orihime... You... You actually... called me "Papa"... 
Orihime! Mr. Ogata! Are you all right?! 
Oh my, it seems we have more trash. 
...!! <br> It's you, Kasha! 
Seems like you're just a bit too late. I've already claimed these two. 
What? What do you plan to do with them?! 
Naturally, trash must be burned. However, I'll make this the ultimate spectacle. Heheheh... 
Urgh. You coward! 
Ensign. I'll be all right. 
Hurry, go and get the others! 
But Orihime, what... What about you?! 
I'm staying here. 
I can't... I can't leave my papa behind! 
Orihime... 
I'll be back to save you!
I can't leave you here! 
...Understood. I'll head to the theater right away. 
But I swear... I'll come back and save you! Just hold on, Orihime!! 
OK... Ensign... 
Don't be silly! I can't just leave you here! 
I'm the captain of the Flower Division. I could never leave my comrades behind! 
Ensign... Just knowing you feel that way is enough for me. 
But you have a duty to keep the capital safe! Please, go! 
Orihime... 
OK, but I'll come right back to save you! Just hold on, Orihime! 
What are you doing, Ensign?! 
You have to keep the capital safe! Go, now! 
Orihime... 
OK, but I'll come right back to save you! Just hold on, Orihime! 
Heheheh... Think you can make it back before I reduce this garbage to ashes? 
I'll save Orihime, you'll see. 
And when I do, it'll be the end for you, Kasha. Prepare yourself!! 
Sorry, Ogami. I can only sell you one photo per month. 
I see. That's too bad. 
So sorry, Mr. Ogami, but each customer is only allowed to purchase one photo at a time.
Oh, really? That's too bad.
