You're hurting me, Mr. Ensign! I will not stand this aggression! 
I’m sorry, Orihime… <br> But you’re coming with me, even if I have to take you by force. 
You have to talk to Mr. Ogata. 
Enough with this! <br> I want nothing to do with that man!
You shouldn’t talk about your father that way, Orihime! 
It's because of him and your mother that you're even here to begin with! 
You both need to have an honest conversation with each other.
… 
All right, we're here. 
…Mr. Ogata. 
Hello there, Ogami… <br> Ah! 
Orihime… 
… 
I'll be waiting over there, Orihime, so you two have a nice, long chat. 
… 
Orihime… 
Don't speak my name so casually! You don't have any right! 
Ahh, Orihime, even the way you get angry reminds me of your mother… 
Stop messing around with me!! 
You abandoned Mamma and I for seventeen years! 
And NOW you want to act like my father? Do you think about anyone but yourself?! 
…You're right, I have no right to call myself your father. 
But if nothing else, believe me when I say this… 
I've never stopped loving you or your mother… Carino. 
That's a lie! <br> Your words mean nothing! 
I don't believe a single thing you're saying! 
Orihime… 
Not another word! <br> I don't want to hear it! Why don't you just… disappear?! 
Wh-What was that?! 
Heheheh… How droll… 
You are… Kasha! 
I can make that man disappear, young miss, just like you wanted. 
Of course, you'll disappear right alongside him… 
Urk… 
Ugh… <br> Ori… hime… 
Hold on! 
Why? <br> Why did you protect me?! 
It's only right that a father… should protect his daughter…
Besides, Carino would… be furious with me… if I let you get hurt. 
Papa… 
…Thank you, Orihime. <br> You… You actually… called me Papa… 
Orihime! Mr. Ogata! <br> Are you all right?! 
My oh my, there appears to be yet more trash. 
…!! <br> It's you, Kasha! 
You're just a bit too late, it seems. I've already claimed these two. 
What? What do you plan to do with them?! 
Naturally, trash must be burned. However, I'll make this disposal into a true spectacle. Heheheh… 
Urgh. You coward! 
Mr. Ensign. <br> I'll be all right. 
Hurry, go and get the others! 
But Orihime, what… <br> What about you?! 
I'm staying here. 
I can't… I can't leave my papa behind! 
Orihime… 
I'll be back to save you!
I can't leave you here! 
…Understood. I'll head to the theater right away. 
But I swear… I'll come back and save you! Just hold on, Orihime!! 
Of course… Mr. Ensign… 
Don't be ridiculous! I can't just abandon you!
I'm the captain of the Flower Division. I could never leave my comrades behind! 
Mr. Ensign… Just knowing you feel that way is enough for me. 
But you have a duty to keep the capital safe! Please, go! 
Orihime… 
OK, but I'll come right back to save you! Just hold on, Orihime! 
What are you doing, Mr. Ensign?! 
You have to keep the capital safe! Go, now! 
Orihime… 
OK, but I'll come right back to save you! Just hold on, Orihime! 
Heheheh… <br> Think you can make it back before this garbage is reduced to ashes?
I'll save Orihime, you'll see. 
And when I do, it'll be the end for you, Kasha. Prepare yourself!! 
Sorry Ogami, but customers are only allowed to purchase one of each bromide. 
I see. That's too bad. 
So sorry, Mr. Ogami, but customers are only allowed to purchase one of each bromide.
Oh, really? That's too bad.
