Heheheh… We're finally ready to give the Assault Troupe a warm welcome.
Without their Spirit Armors, the troupe are but helpless children. I'll kill them all in an instant.
Will you, now?
The Imperial Assault Troupe has arrived!!
Impossible! How do they have their Spirit Armors?!
We won't let you do as you please, Black Demon Society!
Hmhmhm… Well done as always, Imperial Assault Troupe. I commend you.
My name is Suiko, one of the Five Elements of the Black Demon Society.
Even if you have your Spirit Armors, it changes nothing. You're still going to die here.
What?!
You're all trapped. Like. Rats.
You've BEEN trapped since the moment you arrived. Heheheh…
Go ahead and laugh while you still can! Let's go, everyone!
Roger!!
