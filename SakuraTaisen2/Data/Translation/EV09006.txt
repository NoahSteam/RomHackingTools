Is this the bomb?! I have to do something about it, quick, or else Orihime's done for!
I've never dismantled a bomb before, but I don't exactly have a choice!
Dismantle it carefully…
Dismantle it quickly!
Let's dismantle this carefully. It'd be bad if it blew up on me.
First I'll pull out this screw, then pop off the lid at the top right…
O-OK, the lid's open.
Whoa! It's a mess in there! This is going to take some… Hm?
There's something scribbled inside. "3"… "9"… <br> What are these numbers supposed to mean?
At any rate, disarming this bomb is going to take some more time…
Gotta dismantle it quickly! We don't have a second to lose!
Break this panel here…
Break off this red lever…
Phew, still alive. <br> …Hm? The lid on the bottom left came off.
Whoa! It's a mess in there!
Disarming this bomb is going to take some more time…
Wh-What should I do? <br> The clock is ticking…
Now's not the time to be spacing out! I have to at least try something.
First I'll pull out this screw, then pop off the lid at the top right…
O-OK, the lid's open.
Whoa! It's a mess in there!
Disarming this bomb is going to take some more time…
