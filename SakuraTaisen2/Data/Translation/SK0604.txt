The wind has gotten quite strong. 
Indeed. It'll be a proper storm soon. 
Now, about the incident... Do you have anything to report? 
You’re referring to the assassination attempt on Commander Yoneda, am I right? 
As a result of our covert investigation, we've managed to narrow down our suspects. 
The culprit is most likely just as you theorized, Deputy Commander. 
Saki Kageyama, correct? 
But why? What's her goal? Why would she... 
We analyzed the timing of Saki's transmissions with the troupe's deployments and found a connection. 
Whenever Saki would send out a transmission, the Black Demons always made a move a few days later. 
What?! Then that means... <br> It can't be! 
Of course, this is ultimately pure conjecture. 
Damn! If Saki knows our current status, then she probably... 
Oh no! Reni's in danger!! 
Stormy outside, eh? 
It's gotten pretty late after talking with Kayama and Reni, but I should do my night watch. 
Still… For some reason, I feel really uneasy…
