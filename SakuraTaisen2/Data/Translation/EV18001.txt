Wh-What's going on here? What on earth happened to Ouji ward…?
Where is everyone?! They should be here…
Ensign… Just where is everyone?!
Where is everyone? They should have already arrived…
This is strange… Where is everybody?!
Hey Mon Frère, no one's here… What's going on?
How come nobody's here? You can stop hiding now, you know!
What happened to everybody? Come on out, now!
I don't sense anyone nearby… Where did they all go?
Where is everyone?! Please, answer me!
Concerned for your allies?
It's been a while… Ichiro Ogami.
W-Wait, what?!
I-It can't be…
I thought you died… back in Akasaka?!
Hm hm hm… This life of mine will not be extinguished until our great ambitions have been fulfilled.
Heheh, that's right. And we sure turned the tables on those guys from earlier.
Turned the tables… on our friends?!
The guys from earlier… Do you mean the Flower Division? Answer me!
Turned the tables?! No…
You turned the tables…? Then everyone… They… Where are they?!
What did you do to everyone?!
The guys from earlier? You don't mean… our friends?!
The guys from earlier… Just what do you mean? Tell me!!
What happened to them?!
You wish to see them? Then, here they are!
Take a good, long look… Because you will never see them again!!
C-Captain… Forgive me.
O-Ogami… I'm so sorry…
This is the fate of those who oppose me.
E-Everyone!!
Now look on, Assault Troupe. The time to release the final seal upon the Octagram of Demonic Calling has come…
Octagram of… Demonic Calling?!
Just what is that?!
What are you scheming?!
Just what is that?!
Hm hm hm… Since you seek death, I shall tell you.
The Octagram of Demonic Calling is a gate… One which seals a cursed power within the capital.
Just what are you scheming?!
Hm hm hm… Since you seek death, I shall tell you.
We shall release the cursed power sealed within the capital.
…
Are you afraid, Ogami?
Once this final seal is released, all our preparations will be complete…
Vein of evil running through this land, the 8th gate sealing the capital… Appear now before I who have opened you!
Eeeek!
What is this?!
Wh-What?!
Uuwaaaahhh!
Mon Frèreeee!
Wh-What the-?!
Eyyaaaaaahh!
S… Something's happening!
Wh-What is…?
I woulda liked a chance to face off against all of ya… But orders are orders.
Sorry, but I've no interest in toying with prey that's already been caught.
Once the lot of you are dealt with, all of this will be over.
Come now, Kouma! Bear your greedy fangs and devour these sorry souls!
These are… Kouma?!
Kouma! Wh… What is the meaning of this?!
It can't be… Kouma?!
Gah! A buncha Kouma just popped outta nowhere!
Mon Frère… There are way too many Kouma!
Kouma?! This is bad! And these are… embedded with machinery!
These things… are Kouma?! How absolutely foul!
Kouma… And what's more, they've been fused with machines!
Grr… We're surrounded…
But we can't give up here! Let's rescue the others and drive back the Kouma!
