Hey, Chief… Why did you end up choosing me?
Well, that's…
I want to fight together.
You really know the Mikasa.
I want us to fight together, Kohran. From now on, and always.
Wow, Chief, I’m really touched to hear you say that!
Alrighty then! I'm gonna give it my all!  
Yeah. I'm counting on you, Kohran.
Because you know the Mikasa so well. I figured I could ask you for help if we ran into any trouble here.
Alrighty then! You picked the right girl for the job! Just leave it to me! 
Yeah. I'm counting on you, Kohran.
I picked you because you're important to me. Isn’t that enough?
Uh-huh. Of course. Can’t complain with an answer like that.
Alrighty! Let's do this, Chief!
Yeah. I'm counting on you, Kohran.
