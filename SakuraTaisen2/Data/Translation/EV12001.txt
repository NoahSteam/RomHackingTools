This cave must lead to the Black Demon Society's stronghold.
Yeah… Let's move carefully, everyone.
Man, this cave is givin' me the creeps. Feels like somethin' might jump out at any moment.
Mon Frère, I'm kinda scared…
Oh no no, I don't like the looks of this place!
We'd best refrain from unnecessary talk during the mission.
Reni is right. Let's stay focused.
Damn, there are enemies here, too?! They must be on high alert…
Still, we can't afford to back down now! Let's push our way through to the interior!
We'll reconvene in that area on the far side. Let's go, everyone!
Understood!
