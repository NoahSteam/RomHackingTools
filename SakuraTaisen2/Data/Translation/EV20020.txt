Ogami, the Mikasa's going to ram into Musashi at max speed.
The Kouma attacks are likely to intensify the closer we get to Musashi.
However, the Mikasa's anti-air cannons won't be enough to stave off all these Kouma until then.
The Mikasa's weak point is its central vent. Defend it at all costs.
Yes ma'am!
