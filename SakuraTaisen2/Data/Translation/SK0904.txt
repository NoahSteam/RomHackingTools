Right, I should get started on my night watch. 
It's cold out tonight, but I've got a job to do. 
(I should check everyone's rooms first.) 
(I wonder if Iris is asleep already.) 
Who is it? 
It's Ogami. <br> Were you still up, Iris? 
Mon Frère… I can't sleep. Can you come in? 
I see… All right, I'll visit for a little while. 
What's the matter, Iris? Why the long face? 
Well… Jean-Paul and I have been talking. 
We were wondering if it was even possible for me to play the lead role… <br> Since I'm so little. 
… 
*sigh* <br> I wish I could grow up already… 
Right now… I'm no good for the part. 
That's not true. 
Maybe that's a good thing. 
True, it might be too much. 
That's not true at all, Iris. 
There's nothing that says a child can't play the role of an adult. 
I know you'd give a pure, innocent performance. 
…You really think so, Mon Frère? 
I'm no playwright, so I can't say for certain, but that's what I truly believe. 
Mon Frère… 
Thank you, Mon Frère. Now I feel like I can do it! 
No matter what role I wind up with, I'll do my very best! 
Glad to hear it. Break a leg, Iris. 
All right, I have to get back to my patrol. Good night, Iris. 
Good niiiight! 
Maybe that's actually a good thing. 
…Huh? 
Someone as small as you playing the role of an adult might be interesting, no? 
Besides, I know you'd give a pure, innocent performance. 
…You really think so, Mon Frère? 
I'm no playwright, so I can't say for certain, but that's what I truly believe. 
Mon Frère… 
Thank you, Mon Frère. Now I feel like I can do it! 
No matter what role I wind up with, I'll do my very best! 
Glad to hear it. <br> Break a leg, Iris. 
All right, I have to get back to my patrol. Good night, Iris. 
Good niiiight! 
True… This might be a bit too much for you. 
You think so too, huh? 
Everyone was telling me I could do it, but… 
It's still too much for me. 
…I'm sorry, Mon Frère. I'm interrupting your night watch. 
No, it's all right, Iris. 
I might not be good enough now, but I'll keep on practicing… 
And when I grow up, I'll do my best to get the lead role! 
I see… That's great, Iris. 
All right, I have to get back to my patrol. Good night, Iris. 
OK. Good night, Mon Frère. 
Sorry, Iris. As the person picking the lead, there's nothing I can tell you. 
Ah, that's right… <br> Sorry, Mon Frère. 
I'm sorry I couldn't be of any help… 
It's OK. I'll be fine. 
Just talking to you cheered me up a little. 
I see… 
All right, I should get back to my patrol. Good night, Iris. 
OK. Good night, Mon Frère. 
Nothing unusual in the salon. 
I should take a peek in the game room while I'm at it. 
… 
Oh, if it isn't Sumire. 
…! <br> E-Ensign?! 
What are you doing in a place like this? 
W-Well… I was just listening to a record. 
I was imagining how I'd portray the Holy Mother while the music played. Ohohohoho… 
I see… That sounds about right for you, Sumire. 
… 
… 
Sumire… Aren't you going to listen to the record? 
Ah… Y-Yes, that's right. 
… 
Sumire? 
Ensign… Could I ask you something? 
What is it? 
Am I… going to play the lead in "The Miracle Bells"? 
That's the plan. 
I'm still thinking it over. 
…I can't say. 
I… 
Ah! Wait! 
Don't tell me after all, not right now… 
Sumire… 
I… I'd love to play the lead… 
But I don't think I'm ready to. 
I'm… scared to hear your answer. 
Sumire… 
I think I'll be ready to hear it tomorrow. 
Well then, I'll be taking my leave. 
Good night, Sumire. 
Good night, Ensign. Good luck with your night watch. 
… 
Right, back to my patrol.
I'm still thinking it over. 
I see… 
You're really giving this a lot of thought, aren't you, Ensign. 
If you're putting this much effort into choosing the lead… 
Then I know it'll be a wonderful play. 
… 
I'm looking forward to your answer tomorrow. 
Thanks, Sumire. 
Of course, I can promise you that I'll put on the greatest show you've ever seen if you pick me. 
Well then, I'll be taking my leave. Good night, Ensign. 
All right. Good night, Sumire. 
Right, back to my patrol.
I can't tell you, not until tomorrow. 
Y-You're right. What's gotten into me? 
I'll just have to look forward to your answer tomorrow. 
Well then, I'll be taking my leave. Good night, Ensign. 
All right. Good night, Sumire. 
I promise you, Ensign, that I'll put on the greatest show you've ever seen if you pick me. 
Sumire… 
Sorry, Sumire. As the person picking the lead, there's nothing I can tell you. 
Y-You're right. What's gotten into me? 
I shall wait until tomorrow, with my heart pounding all the while. 
Well then, I'll be taking my leave. Good night, Ensign. 
All right. Good night, Sumire. 
I promise you, Ensign, that I'll put on the greatest show you've ever seen if you pick me. 
Sumire… 
Nothing unusual in the hall… 
Oh, right, I should check the terrace, too. 
Oh… Captain. 
Maria? What are you doing here? 
Apologies, sir… I was reading this script and got caught up in it. 
I completely lost track of what time it was. 
Hahaha, how passionate of you. 
So much has happened this past year… 
This will be the final performance to cap it all off.
… 
A special performance where I get to spend Christmas Eve with you… 
I want to make this play a success… No matter what. 
Maria… 
It's going to be a success. 
Big responsibility, huh?
You should get some sleep. 
It's all right, Maria. It's going to be a success. I know the audience will recognize your feelings. 
Captain… Thank you.
Now come on, you'll catch a cold if you stay out here. Let's get back inside. 
Right. 
Let's make the Christmas play a hit, Captain. 
Yeah. Let's do this, Maria. 
Yes, sir. 
This is a big responsibility, huh? I have to pick who's going to lead in such an important play… 
It'll be OK, sir. Everyone in the Flower Division has their own unique skills and character.
I'm sure they'll all put on a wonderful performance that will meet your expectations.
All that's left is for you to give them a little push. 
… 
All right then, sir, I'll be heading back to my room. 
OK. Good night, Maria. 
Good night, Captain. Good luck with your night watch. 
All right, let’s continue with my rounds.
I know how you feel, Maria, but you should call it a night. 
Besides, it's freezing out here, so you’d better come back inside. 
Yes, you're exactly right. Let's return indoors. 
All right then, sir, I'll be heading back to my room. 
OK. Good night, Maria. 
Good night, Captain. Good luck with your night watch. 
All right, let’s continue with my rounds.
I'm being allowed to help out with the play this time. 
So I want this to be a success just as much as you do, Maria. 
Right. Do your best, sir. 
Yeah. Thanks, Maria. 
All right then, sir, I'll be heading back to my room. 
OK. Good night, Maria. 
Good night, Captain. Good luck with your night watch. 
All right, let’s continue with my rounds. 
OK, where to next? 
Hm? Seems like someone's out in the yard. 
… 
Is that you, Reni? What are you doing standing around in a place like this? 
Captain? 
I just felt like moving around all of a sudden… <br> So I came here. 
Captain… If you don't mind, could you watch me dance? 
Sure, no problem. 
Watch you… dance? 
I'm patrolling right now…
Sure, no problem. 
Thank you. <br> All right… Here I go. 
Hah! 
(Whoa…) 
(Reni's always so quiet, I never imagined she could dance with such passion.) 
Did you know… There's a god of the stage? 
…A god? 
That's right. Whenever an actor surpasses a certain level with their dance or performance… 
The god smiles as he watches them perform.
So I'm going to give "The Miracle Bells" all I've got… So that the god may smile upon us. 
I want to make this play a success… No matter what. 
Reni… 
Sorry, Captain. I know you're in the middle of your night watch. 
No, it's fine. Don't worry about it. 
…Thank you. All right, I'm going back to my room. 
I see. Good night, Reni. 
Good night, Captain. 
Well… I ought to get going, too. 
Watch you… dance? 
When I was in the Star Division, I learned ballet. 
I see… I had no idea. 
Well then… Here I go. 
Hah! 
(Whoa…) 
(Reni's always so quiet, I never imagined she could dance with such passion.) 
Did you know… There's a god of the stage? 
…A god? 
That's right. Whenever an actor surpasses a certain level with their dance or performance… 
The god smiles as he watches them perform.
So I'm going to give "The Miracle Bells" all I've got… So that the god may smile upon us. 
I want to make this play a success… No matter what. 
Reni… 
Sorry, Captain. I know you're in the middle of your night watch. 
No, it's fine. Don't worry about it. 
…Thank you. All right, I'm going back to my room. 
I see. Good night, Reni. 
Good night, Captain. 
Well… <br> I ought to get going, too. 
I appreciate the offer, but I'm in the middle of my patrol. 
I see… Sorry. 
All right, I gotta go. Try not to stay up too late, OK, Reni? 
Yes, understood. 
Sorry, Reni. Since I'll be choosing the lead, I can't give special treatment and only watch you dance.
I see… Sorry. 
All right, I gotta go. Try not to stay up too late, OK, Reni? 
Yes, understood. 
OK… Time to start patrolling underground. 
Hm? Is that you, Kanna? 
Oh, Boss? 
I was just readin' the lines for the Holy Mother… This is tough. 
I've played almost nothin’ but masculine roles like King Lear or Son Goku up till now. 
Do you really think I have what it takes to play a feminine role like this? 
Of course you do! 
Well, who knows? 
True, that might be tough. 
Of course you do! <br> You'd be great, Kanna. 
Huh? R-Really? 
Yeah, really. Don't think about it so hard. 
Just throw yourself into the part like you always do, Kanna. 
Boss… 
Thanks, Boss. I'm feelin' a bit more confident now. 
It's true, there's some performances only I can do in the Flower Division. 
I just gotta do things my own way. Maybe a boyish heroine wouldn't be so bad. 
Heheh, now I'm lookin' forward to how this play turns out, too. 
Kanna… 
Thanks, Boss! Whether I get the lead or not, I think I can put on a good show. 
All right, time for me to hit the hay already. Night, Boss! 
Yeah, good night. 
Well… I ought to get going, too. 
Well, who knows? Nobody can predict how things will turn out.
But, so long as you give it your all, I know it'll turn out great. No matter what role you end up with.
Boss… 
You're right. Sweatin’ over this isn’t gonna get me anywhere. 
I'll do my best, in my own way. 
Heheh, who knows, the audience might even like a lead that's a bit more boyish. 
Kanna… 
Thanks, Boss! Whether I get the lead or not, I think I can put on a good show. 
All right, time for me to hit the hay already. Night, Boss! 
Yeah, good night. 
Well… I ought to get going, too. 
True, that might be tough. 
You think so too, huh, Boss? 
This is way too big of a role for me… 
Well, whether I get the lead or not, I'll give it all I've got. 
I see… 
Oh, whoops, would ya look at the time. 
All right, time for me to hit the hay already. Night, Boss! 
Yeah, good night. 
Well… I ought to get going, too. 
Sorry, Kanna. As the person picking the lead, there's nothing I can tell you. 
Ah… You're right. 
My bad, I was talkin' nonsense. 
All right, time for me to hit the hay already. Night, Boss! 
Yeah, good night. 
Well… I ought to get going, too. 
Now then, up next is the music room. 
Hm? Orihime, is that you? 
That voice… 
Mr. Ensign… On your night watch, are you? 
Were you playing the piano just now? 
Yes… That is what I came here to do… 
But whenever I try to play some music… I am not able to. 
Huh? 
To play the piano, you need not only your fingers, but your heart, as well. 
Usually, my fingers will move without even my thinking…
Perhaps "The Miracle Bells" is the cause. I can't picture the lead role clear enough in my mind… 
Orihime… 
Believe in yourself.
It happens. 
You should get to bed. 
Believe in yourself, Orihime. Tell yourself you can do it. 
Try to remember the usual Orihime, overflowing with confidence. 
Mr. Ensign… 
… 
…! <br> I did it! 
See, Orihime? You were able to play the piano just now. 
Mr. Ensign… Thank you. 
You don't have to worry about me anymore, Mr. Ensign. 
I am back to my normal self! Overflowing with confidence! 
Hahaha… Glad to hear it. 
I can even imagine the lead role for the Christmas play perfectly in my mind. 
You can relax, Mr. Ensign, the show's in buone mani! 
(…Buone mani? Does she mean to say the play's in good hands?) 
It happens. Don't rush things, just wait it out. 
You'll be able to play again before long. 
…Really? 
You're always so full of confidence, so you might not have a lot of experience with this… 
But everyone has their off days, you know? 
… 
All right, you should probably head to bed for today. 
Understood. All right then, Mr. Ensign, good night. 
Yeah, good night. 
OK, I should get going too. 
You must be tired. You should go to bed for today. 
… 
C'mon, Orihime… 
How frustrating this is… but I'll go back to my room. 
All right then, Mr. Ensign, good night. 
Yeah, good night. 
OK, I should get going too. 
Sorry, Orihime. As the person picking the lead, there's nothing I can tell you. 
…Oh, that is right. 
I do not see the harm in talking about something like this, though. 
All right then, Mr. Ensign, I will be going back to my room. Good night. 
Yeah, good night. 
OK, I should get going too. 
Let's see… Guess I’ll go check backstage. 
Oh… Kohran? 
Ah, Chief! 
Couldn't sleep? 
Y-Yeah… 
I was just thinking about the Christmas play… 
Chief… What do you think will happen if I'm the star? 
You can't tell when it's all tied up in braids, but my hair's actually super frizzy. 
On top of that, I can't see a thing without my glasses, so I gotta wear them on stage. 
The Holy Mother, wearing glasses… That'd just be weird, right? 
Of course not. 
That might make it better.
You may have a point. 
Of course not. You're worrying too much. 
Your glasses, your hair, that's not what matters. 
It's the emotion of the performer that matters most, isn't it? 
Chief… 
Talking with you has made me feel a bit more confident somehow… 
I'm gonna try my best. 
I'm gonna get up on that stage with all the emotion I've got! 
Kohran… 
All right then, I'll head back to my room. 
Thanks a bunch, Chief. I mean it. Good luck with your night watch! 
Kohran… 
Actually… That might make it even better. 
A heroine wearing glasses? That's fresh and new! 
Y-You think so…? 
Sure I do! Have a little faith in yourself, Kohran. 
Your cheerfulness is the best thing about you. Bring that with you up on stage! 
Chief… 
All right, Chief, I'll do it! 
Whether I get the lead or not, I'm gonna be cheerful as heck up there! 
I'll show everyone in the audience my good side! 
Kohran… 
…I feel a lot better now. 
All right, I'm gonna head back to my room. Good luck with your night watch! 
Sure, good night. 
Good night, Chief… And thanks a lot… I mean it. 
Kohran… 
Hmm… You may have a point. 
You think so too, huh, Chief? 
I knew it, I can't do it with these glasses of mine… 
Kohran… 
…It's OK, Chief. 
I'll do my best up there, in my own way! 
I think my upbeat personality is my strong point. 
So whether I get the lead role or not, I'm gonna give it my all! 
I see… 
All right then, I'll head back to my room. 
Thanks a bunch, Chief. I mean it. Good luck with your night watch! 
Kohran… 
Sorry, Kohran. I've been worrying about who to pick, myself. 
I can't be having this discussion with you if I'm going to remain impartial. 
Ah… O-Of course! 
You're totally right. Sorry about that. 
OK, Chief, I'm gonna head back to my room. 
Sure. Good night, Kohran. 
Night, Chief. Good luck with your night watch. 
Well… I ought to get going, too. 
OK, last up, time to check the stage. 
Hm? Sounds like someone's here. 
Spin to the right… <br> Put your foot out… 
(It's Sakura. Is she practicing some kind of dance?) 
…Who is it? 
(…! <br> She spotted me!) 
Ogami… 
Sorry, Sakura. Didn't mean to interrupt your dance practice. 
No, it's all right. I was thinking about wrapping up anyway. 
I see… 
Were you rehearsing for the upcoming play? 
N-No, that was just a dance I learned a long time ago. 
Whenever I feel like I'm about to lose track of my current role or the play… 
I always repeat that dance. 
Sakura… 
You've got this, Sakura. 
Fundamentals are important.
You should get to bed. 
You've got this, Sakura. 
Thank you. I'll do my best. 
I'll go back to basics, start fresh and do the best I can.
That way… If I give it everything I got, I won’t have any regrets.
Sakura… 
All right, Ogami, I'll be going back to my room. Good work on your night watch. 
Yeah, thanks. <br> Good night, Sakura. 
Of course. <br> Good night, Ogami. 
OK, it's about time I wrapped up my patrol. I should head back to my room, too. 
The fundamentals are important. Sometimes you just have to go back to basics. 
Yes, that's true. 
I remember the first time I danced… How nervous I felt, how much fun I had… 
And I remember how I felt going up on stage for the very first time… 
I feel like it all came back to me just now. 
Sakura… 
All right, Ogami, I'll be going back to my room. Good work on your night watch. 
Yeah, thanks. <br> Good night, Sakura. 
Of course. <br> Good night, Ogami. 
OK, it's about time I wrapped up my patrol. I should head back to my room, too. 
Don't overdo it, it's bad for your health. You should get to bed. 
…OK. Understood. 
Good work on your night watch, Ogami. Good night. 
Yeah, good night, Sakura. 
OK, it's about time I wrapped up my patrol. I should head back to my room, too. 
Sorry, Sakura. As the person picking the lead, there's nothing I can tell you. 
Ah… S-Sorry, I started talking about some weird things, didn't I? 
Don't worry about what I said just now. 
All right, Ogami, I'll be going back to my room. Good work on your night watch. 
Yeah, thanks. <br> Good night, Sakura. 
Of course. <br> Good night, Ogami. 
OK, it's about time I wrapped up my patrol. I should head back to my room, too. 
Phew, finally done with my night watch. 
Still, everyone's doing their best for this Christmas play. 
Just who should I pick…? 
Sorry Ogami, but customers are only allowed to purchase one of each bromide. 
I see. That's too bad. 
So sorry, Mr. Ogami, but customers are only allowed to purchase one of each bromide.
Oh, really? That's too bad.
