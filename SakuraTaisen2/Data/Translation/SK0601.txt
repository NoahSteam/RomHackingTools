…And that concludes the briefing on yesterday's battle. 
At any rate, the Black Demons have been pretty active as of late. 
Yes, we've already deployed three times in the past two weeks. 
The Black Demon Society… Just what is it they're after? 
They're not so tough, so long as we all stick together! Right, Reni? 
…Y-Yeah. 
… 
All right, everyone, that's it for today. Dismissed. 
Welp, suppose we better start rehearsin’ for our autumn production of "The Blue Bird." 
Let's go, Reni! We're the stars this time! 
… 
OK, we'll all meet up on stage after we've gotten changed. Excuse us, Ogami. 
Right, I should head back to my room, too. 
Do you have a moment, Ogami? 
Yes, what is it, Kaede? 
Actually… It's about Reni. 
I feel like her movements in combat have been getting sloppy lately. 
Almost like… she's hesitant about fighting. 
Reni? Seriously? 
Well, I may be overthinking things. Don’t give it too much thought.
Anyway, good work today. Please excuse me. 
Reni… 
All right… Now that I’ve finished changing, what should I do next? 
Oh yeah, everyone's rehearsing for our autumn production, right? 
I'm a bit worried about Reni. I should go check and see how she's doing. 
Oh, looks like they’ve already started.
Let's see… I think I’ll watch for a bit.
Hey, Tyltyl, do you think Santa will visit our house too?
…He won't be coming this year. Mother has been too busy to invite him.
What?! But Ren-- <br> Uh, I mean, Tyltyl, you know I've been a good girl all year!
…There's nothing we can do. But, I’ve heard that he will still be visiting the homes of the rich.
This is "The Blue Bird," right? They're both really getting into their roles. 
Reni and Iris are a perfect fit for Tyltyl and Mytyl.
Oh, looks like it's time for the fight scene in the forest. 
Leave this place, children! I, the Forest King, shall not allow you to pass! 
Tyltyl, I'm frightened…
It's all right, Mytyl, there's nothing to fear. Just stay behind me.
Come at me! I'll take you on with this knife! 
Tell me, boy… <br> Why are you doing this? For what purpose do you fight? 
I'm protecting Mytyl…! <br> I'm… I'm… 
I'm… 
Sorry… Once more…
What's wrong, Reni? Did you forget your lines? It's this one, right here! 
… 
All right, then. Let’s take it from the top.
Oh my, I guess Reni really is human after all. Ohohoho. 
I can't believe Reni would flub her line like that. 
Reni… 
Encourage Reni. 
Talk to the others.
Everyone makes mistakes, Reni, don't worry about it. 
Heh, that's our boss, considerate as always! Don't worry 'bout it, Reni! 
Goodness, Kanna, if you bellow at her like that, you'll only discourage her! 
High-level actors don't NEED encouragement! 
Hmmm, really? 
Shh! Quiet! The scene's starting again! 
Seriously, what's wrong with Reni? 
She started acting out of sorts once they reached this scene. 
You'd think a fight scene like this would be no problem for her… 
Shh! They're starting that last scene again. 
C'mon, Boss, shouldn't you say something to Reni? 
No. I'm not very knowledgeable about theater, and I wouldn't want to distract her. 
My, Ensign, aren't you considerate? 
You made the right call. Reni doesn't need any encouragement. 
Shh! Quiet! The scene's starting again! 
Come at me! I'll take you on with this knife! 
Tell me, boy… <br> Why are you doing this? For what purpose do you fight? 
I'm… 
… 
…Reni? 
I can't concentrate… 
Reni… 
Sorry… 
Oh well. Let's just take a break for now. 
What's wrong, Reni? You've been acting weird. 
… 
Did something happen? Come on, tell me.
… 
The role is… <br> It’s not coming to me…
Huh? 
… 
Sorry… I need to be alone for a while… 
Ah! Reni!! 
R-Reni? Are you all right? 
Reni's acting strangely. I think she might be broken! 
… 
Aw, jeez… She just up and left. Nothing we can do…
In her current state, Reni's in no shape to be rehearsing.
Reni… 
It's just like Kaede said. Something's up with Reni. 
I'll try talking to her a bit. She might be back in her room by now. 
Tell me some gossip. 
I'll come back later. 
Oh yeah, Ogami, have you met Tsubomi, our new shopkeep, yet? 
Yeah, I just ran into her. She’s, uh, quite lively. 
Yes, she seems overjoyed to be working here. 
We have to be on our best behavior with a new girl on the team! 
By the way, Ogami, I have a huge scoop. 
A huge scoop, you say? 
Uh-huh! Tsubaki's out on a secret assignment but I have her call number! 
H-Huh?! You know her number? 
Yes, she has a transceiver on hand in case of emergency. 
Ready, Ogami? Her number is “13600.” 
13600… Got it. There, I got it written down. 
I went through a lot of trouble to get you that number, so you better give her a call! 
Yeah, of course. I'll make sure to contact her. 
Oh, I already figured out her number by myself. 13600, right? 
By yourself?! Wow, Ogami, you sure don't waste any time, do you? 
Wh-What's that supposed to mean? 
Hm hm, I'm sure Tsubaki was quite surprised to receive a call from you out of the blue. 
By the way, just where is Tsubaki, anyway? 
Heehee, about that… 
Yuri! That's top-secret, remember? 
Huh?! But I wanna tell him! It's OK if we only tell Ogami, right? 
Absolutely not. 
We'll tell you when the time is right, Ogami, so please just bear with us. 
…I-I understand. 
Oh yeah, Ogami, the Rose Division just finished setting up a room downstairs! 
When did they find the time to do that? 
They have all kinds of interesting stories. 
We might hear some exciting gossip from them, so let’s drop by and say hi every now and then! 
Oh boy, that's Yuri for you. 
It seems like this typhoon is hitting the Kanto region head-on. I'm worried. 
They're even telling everyone on the radio not to go out tonight. 
It's true, the scariest part of a storm like this isn't the rain, it's being hit by flying debris. 
Transit around the capital will come to a standstill, too. 
It's finally time for the autumn production to start, isn't it, Ogami. 
“The Blue Bird," right? I'm looking forward to it as well. 
It's Reni's big debut, all the patrons are talking about it. 
Ticket preorders are selling like hotcakes. 
Really? Guess everyone's looking forward to this performance. 
(But with Reni in the state she’s in right now, I wonder how it will turn out.) 
That's right, I heard some amazing news on the radio yesterday. 
Oh, you mean about that steam submarine? 
…Steam submarine? 
Yes, it seems that one of the Navy's steam submarines wouldn't resurface no matter what they tried.
Apparently, they finally pulled it out of the water with nothing but rope and manpower.
Wow, really? 
That's the honest truth. They said so on the news. 
How was your vacation last month, Ogami? 
It got pretty crazy, but I had a lot of fun. Wish you could've come with us. 
*sigh* <br> I bought a new swimsuit and everything, but I never got the chance to show it off. 
Oh? Didn't you swim in the underground pool while everyone was on vacation? 
Yeah, but that's just our pool. I'm not gonna find any cute boys to swim with there. 
Sorry, Ogami, but I'm all out of gossip for now. 
I'll have some more interesting tidbits to share another time, so look forward to it! 
I'll be back. Good luck with the rest of your work. 
OK. Thanks for coming, Ogami.
