How does it feel to pilot the Tenbu, Sakura?
It's incredible! It's so powerful, and moves like a dream. There's no way we can lose with these!
Let's push on through!
Don't let your guard down!
Don't break it!
Let's push on through! Everyone is waiting for us inside!
Right! Let's give this our all, Ogami!
Yeah!
Victory may seem assured, but don't let your guard down until this is through!
Understood! <br> I'll keep my wits about me until the very end!
Yeah!
Haha, just don't get too cocky and break the darn thing. Kohran would never forgive us.
Heheh, that's true. You be careful with it too, Ogami.
Now, let's go get everyone out of there!
Right!
…
…Ogami? Are you having trouble operating it?
Uh, no, that's not it…
Anyway, everyone's waiting for us to come save them. Let's hurry and bust right through this place!
Yeah, got it!
