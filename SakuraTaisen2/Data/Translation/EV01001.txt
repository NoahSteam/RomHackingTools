Are those chumps defendin' the capital comin' or what? The Imperial Assault Troupe, or whatever.
Fwohohoho… <br> It doesn't matter who shows up, my plan is flawless.
Hmph! I don't need any of your cheap tricks!
You're always relyin' too much on that crap, Mokujiki!
Fwohohoho… <br> Please, they're not tricks. I prefer "calculations."
Oh… Enough prattling. It seems they're finally here.
The Imperial Assault Troupe has arrived!!
I've been waitin' for ya, Imperial Assault Troupe!
I am Kongou, the head of the Black Demon Society's Five Elements!
And I am Mokujiki. Fwohohoho…
The Black Demon Society? The Imperial Assault Troupe won't aide anyone who threatens the capital!
Oh shut it, you dirtbags!
Let's not lose our temper, Kongou. Even if I must, I'm loath to kill them when they're still so ignorant.
I can't expect them to hear it from Yamazaki when they reach Hell, either.
What?!
The capital has only prospered like it has by feeding off of an evil energy.
You seek to seal away such evil, but alas, that's nothing more than a futile delusion…
Quit blabbin', Mokujiki!
Hyahaha! <br> Might makes right. <br> Now, show them your might, Kongou!
Y-You cur!!
Direct hit.
What?!
Reni!
C-Curse you! How could anyone exceed my calculations?!
If you're not gonna make yourself useful then scram!
Kongou, the rest is up to you.
Primary target has left the battlefield… Secondary target must be subjugated.
Heehee! <br> That was awesome, Reni!
Now this makes me happy… Seeing a strong opponent gets me all pumped up.
…
I won't go easy on ya! <br> Now, come at me!
Urgh… But we have to prioritize the safety of the cilivians!
We'll take care of the guys up top later! First we need to eliminate all the foes terrorizing the people!
