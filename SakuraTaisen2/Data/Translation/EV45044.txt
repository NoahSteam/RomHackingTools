Hey, Boss! How come ya left me behind on such an important mission?!
Well, you see…
You're too important to me…
I wanted you to lead them. 
You're too important to me, Kanna. I couldn't bear to let anything bad happen to you.
Wh… Oh, shove it with that crap!
Sheesh, why the hell're you fussin' over me like this?
You know I ain't some fragile little girl, dont'cha?
I-I know. But still…
Naw, I get it, Boss. Guess I'm not all that offended or anything.
Anyway, you just leave these guys to me, and do what you gotta do!
…OK. Thanks, Kanna.
I knew that if I left the second squad in your command, I'd have nothing to worry about.
Oh! I knew you had some kinda plan up your sleeve, Boss!
All right, you just leave these guys to me, and do what you gotta do!
…OK. Thanks, Kanna.
Um, no reason in particular, I guess…
Huh? Wait, you mean it?
I'm sorry, Kanna. It seems like I've just made things more uncomfortable…
Nah, it's fine, I guess…
In any case, let's both give it everything we've got. I'm countin' on you!
Yeah! You just leave it to me!
