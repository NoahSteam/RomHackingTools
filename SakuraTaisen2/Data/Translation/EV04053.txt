Hey, Chief. <br> I know it's been a while, but do you remember my Koubu's specialty?
Frontal assault.
Rear support.
Self-destruction.
Let's see… Your unit is a front-line assault type, right?
Huh? What are talking about, Chief?
My Koubu supports from the rear using long-range attacks. Try not to forget, OK?
A rear support unit, right? Your Koubu has to stay behind the others and provide cover.
Bingo! <br> I'm so glad you remembered!
It self-destructs, right? I mean, everything you touch DOES explode.
Hahaha! That was pretty harsh, Chief. Of course my Koubu won't blow up.
…
…You forgot, didn't'cha, Chief?
…Sorry.
Eh, it's OK. <br> You'll remember after we fight for a bit.
