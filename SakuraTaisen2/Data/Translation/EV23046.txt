Two more! <br> We're almost done!
Two more! Nearly finished!
And that makes six. <br> Only a few remain.
Just two more! <br> We're nearly done!
All right! Just two left!
That's the sixth one! <br> We're almost finished!
Two more to go! <br> Can't give up now!
Only two remain! <br> Not long now!
Sechs…
I knew you fools would put up a fight. But you'd best not make light of… the power of Keigo Kyogoku! 
Now, turn your minds… towards your inevitable demise! Ahahahaha!!
