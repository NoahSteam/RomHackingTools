Two more! We're almost done!
Two more! Nearly finished!
And that makes six. Only a few remain.
Just two more! We're nearly done!
All right! Just two left!
That's the sixth one! We're almost finished!
Two more to go! Can't give up now!
Only two remain! Not long now!
Sechs…
I knew you fools would put up a fight. But you'd best not make light of… the power of Keigo Kyogoku! 
Now, turn your minds… towards your inevitable demise! Ahahahaha!!
