Mon Frère… Can I ask you something?
What is it, Iris?
Why did you bring me with you?
You see…
I want you by my side.
I want you to protect me.
Because I want you to be by my side. Isn’t that obvious?
Huh? Is that really true, Mon Frère?
Yes, of course! Let's do this together, Iris.
Yeah! I'm gonna work super-duper hard!
The things is, I get scared when I'm alone. I want you to protect me.
Oh, OK! I'll protect you, Mon Frère!
I can become stronger for your sake!
Hahaha, that'd be reassuring. Now let's get going, Iris!
Okey-dokey!
Hmmm… Why did I?
…? <br> Mon Frère, did you ask me to join your team without even thinking about it?
Hahaha, I was only kidding. I just want to be with you.
All right, we're running out of time. Let's go, Iris!
OK!
