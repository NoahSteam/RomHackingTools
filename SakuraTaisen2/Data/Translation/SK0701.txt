Five Elements of the Black Demon Society… Only three sealed gates remain. 
And now our master himself is preparing to make his move. 
Fwohoho… <br> Our master is like a black moon in a dark night. 
The capital only prospers because it's brimming with wicked power. 
Who gives a damn about any of that?! We know where those bastards live! Gimme the order to move out!! 
They killed Suiko! <br> I'll make 'em pay for what they've done! 
Fwohoho… <br> You're quite feisty, Kongou. You'll be the next to die, at this rate. 
An idiot neglects their plans, but only a fool rushes to their death. 
Bah! 
Hmph! Your emotions will only get you killed. 
…What?! 
Suiko died because she couldn't cast her femininity aside. Heh… How pathetic. 
What did you say?! 
Silence Kongou! Tsuchigumo! 
I entrust our next operation to you, Kasha. 
Hmph. Very well. The capital, the Assault Troupe, my flames will reduce them all to ash. 
Heheheh… <br> Nothing brings me joy quite like incinerating worthless garbage. 
…Don't get careless. 
It's human instinct to fear fire. You need not worry. 
Yaaay, yaaay! <br> Festival time, festival tiiiime!! 
Iris, you'll get lost if you keep running off like that. 
But this is so much fun! Right, Reni? 
Y-Yeah. 
Yakisoba, ningyo-yaki, candied plums… <br> Where do I even begin?! 
I swear, it's always food with you. How boorish. 
What's wrong with that? This festival only comes around once a year, y'know. 
Looks like they have a kamishibai set up here, too. I'm gonna enjoy myself today, I love slide shows! 
Sheesh, you all are certainly cheerful. 
All right, Ogami, I'll be going with the others. 
The autumn festival… <br> It's not so bad getting to be a kid again every once in a while. 
Browse the stalls. 
Watch the kamishibai. 
Take a break. 
Let's see… Guess I'll browse the stalls. 
Hey. Mon. Frère!
Iris? How are you enjoying the festival? 
It's super fun! There's so many different kinds of stalls here! 
Oh, yeah? I was just about to go browse them myself. 
Really?! Then you can come with me! 
C'mon, hurry, hurry! 
Hahaha, all right, let's go, then. 
Ahh, that was so much fun! Thanks, Mon Frère! 
I had a lot of fun too, seeing all those stalls. 
Uh-huh! We should bring Reni along next time! 
See you later, Mon Frère! Bye-bye! 
Hahaha, she ran around so much, and yet she's still full of energy. 
Right, what should I do next? 
I'm kinda tired now, but I still had a good time, Mon Frère. 
Yeah, it was fun seeing all the different stalls. 
Uh-huh! We should bring Reni along next time! 
See you later, Mon Frère! Bye-bye! 
Right, what should I do next? 
Phew… I'm tired. 
I'm sorry, Iris. There were so many people running around… 
No, it's all right. I know you tried your best for me. 
See you later, Mon Frère! Bye-bye! 
Right, what should I do next? 
OK, time for a-- ACHOO! Fun kamishibai! Everyone here? Good. Candy? Here ya go. Bathroom? Just hold it in.
*sniff* Sorry, I have a cold. Anyway, Masked Red! Lively and pure of heart, he is the ideal young man! 
Overcoming all obstacles, today he… No, ya have to pay for the candy, kid. He rides forth once again! 
The brilliant scientist, Dr. Yukawa, has just invented a new weapon: the gamma- ACHOO! Gamma bomb! 
The evil Skull X is- ACHOO! Sorry. Skull X is after the blueprints, and sends out his iron robot, Sigma! 
“Mwahaha! Dr. Yukawa! I, Skull X, have taken your daughter!" 
“Fatheeeeeerrrrr!!" 
“Ohhh, Masae! Won't some strapping young lad please save my daughter?!" 
But! Just then! 
VROOM! Brmbrmbrmbrm-- ACHOO! Brmbrmbrmbrm! <br> That's the noise the scooter makes, you see. 
Straddling his trusty scooter, the Mach Red, the boy wonder makes his flashy entrance!
Masked Red, the one and only, is on the scene! 
“Skull X! Unhand that girl!" 
“So you've finally arrived, Masked Red! Witness the power of my robot, Sigma!" 
BWOOOOM! <br> Drdrdrdr… 
“Red, look!" 
“Ah! The enemy robot!" 
Their surprise was perfectly understandable. 
Sigma, with Skull X and Masae in hand, shot up into the sky, leaving a trail of flames in its wake! 
The robot's pla- ACHOO! Platinum frame, lit up by searchlights, grows smaller in the night sky.
“Heheheh… Farewell, Masked Red, my boy!" 
“REEEEEEED!" 
“Masae! Curse you, Skull X! I'll never give up!" 
And so, Masked Red begins his pursu-- ACHOO! Pursuit of Sigma! 
What fate awakes-- er, no, AWAITS the kidnapped Masae?! 
…All right, that's enough for today. See you kids next time! Make sure to buy more candy! Later. 
I'm feeling kinda tired. I think I'll take a break. 
Spacing out with nothing else to do, Mr. Ensign? What else is new? 
Hey, Orihime. What about you? How are you doing? 
Actually, I have nothing to do, either. 
I see. Well, why don't we take a walk together, then? 
Spend time with YOU, Mr. Ensign? Hmmm, whatever shall I do? 
Well, I do have free time to kill, so I will let you accompany me, just this once. 
Now quit dawdling before I leave you behind. 
Ah! Orihime! Wait for me! 
Sheesh, same Orihime as ever… 
Well, Orihime? What do you think of Japanese festivals? 
Italian feste are hundreds, no, THOUSANDS of times grander in scale! 
They're far more elegant and passionate, too. Don't even think of comparing them. 
H-Hey now, don’t be like that… Let's just enjoy ourselves while we're here. 
Eh, I suppose I can find ways to pass the time. 
Huh, looks like that man over there's got a stall set up. 
I think he might be a portrait artist! 
Welcome, miss. <br> I can paint your portrait, if you'd like. 
Hmmm, I wonder how good this guy really is. 
Despite appearances, I'm not much of an artist, though I did study the craft in Italy. 
…Huh? 
…! <br> A-Are you…? <br> No, it can't be… 
…! <br> I-Is that you? Orihime?! 
Is he an acquaintance of yours, Orihime? 
D-Don't say so stupid a thing! 
As if I would ever make the acquaintance of a Japanese man!! 
But it sounded like you recognized him. 
Shut up, the both of you! If I say I don't know him, then I don't know him! 
Now my mood is ruined! <br> I'm going home! 
Ah! O-Orihime, wait!! 
…Don't worry about me. Please, go after her. 
A-All right, I'll do that. Apologies for the commotion, sir. Excuse me. 
… 
Orihime… 
Sorry Ogami, but customers are only allowed to purchase one of each bromide. 
I see. That's too bad. 
So sorry, Mr. Ogami, but customers are only allowed to purchase one of each bromide.
