Sorry Ogami, but customers are only allowed to purchase one of each bromide. 
I see. That's too bad. 
So sorry, Mr. Ogami, but customers are only allowed to purchase one of each bromide.
Oh, really? That's too bad. 
… "" "" () - . , ! ? ?! !! 
*yawn* <br> Ahh, I slept great. 
Today's my first day off in ages. I should take it easy. 
Well, Ogami? <br> Pretty neat, huh? 
Come back down here whenever you want to take another look. 
OK. I'll be going, then. 
Hello, Ogami. 
If you listen to what Mr. Yoneda has to say, you might just learn the trick to getting a high score. 
Well, if you ever feel like using the training unit some more, stop by my room. 
OK. I'll be going, then. 
Hey Kasumi, hey Yuri. What are you two still doing here on your day off? 
Actually, we've been waiting here to tell you something, Ogami. 
Some handy info for having fun on your day off!
Stop by and ask us whenever you want! 
Ah, Ogami! Here to listen to our information again? 
Shall we tell you what we have to say once more? 
Listen to Kasumi. 
Listen to Yuri. 
Nothing to ask about. 
All right, Kasumi, let's hear what you've got for me. 
Right, understood. 
I'm sure you've already been to a lot of the other rooms, Ogami… 
But you can only visit with the Flower Division members that you have made memories with.
Then you can relive the experiences you had with them and the games you played.
Make lots of memories so you can really enjoy your day off. 
Make lots of memories so you can really enjoy your day off. 
All right, Yuri, let's hear what you've got for me. 
OK, got it! 
Today's your day off, so there's still a lot of memories you can make. 
Make sure to record everything in your room's journal, that way you won't forget all these memories.
Try to remember all the games you played with everyone and your scores.
When you go to your room, you ought to be able to: "Write in journal and sleep." 
You should make a habit of writing in your journal when you're done for the day.
When you go to your room, you ought to be able to: "Write in journal and sleep." 
You should make a habit of writing in your journal when you're done for the day.
Thanks, but I don't have any questions right now. 
OK, but if there's anything you don't understand, don't hesitate to ask us! 
Have a pleasant day off, Ogami. 
Ah, Ogami! Welcome! 
Hey, Tsubaki. You seem chipper as ever. 
Absolutely! I just got some new stock in today! 
They're special bromides of the Flower Division, bigger than the normal ones! 
These are just display units, not for sale, but you can take a look if you want. 
Welcome, Ogami! Want to see the extra-large bromides? 
Please show me. 
Maybe some other time. 
Wow, that sounds neat. Please, show me. 
OK! Here you go.
Did you enjoy them, Ogami? 
You can look at the bromides again, if you want. 
All right, once more. 
That's enough for now. 
No, that's enough for now. Thanks, Tsubaki. 
I see. Come back again whenever you'd like to have another look!
Well, if you insist, then sure, I'll take another look at them.
OK! Feel free to take all the time you'd like! 
I appreciate it, but maybe next time. 
I see. Well, if you ever change your mind, you can stop by whenever! 
Oh, Ogami. 
Kasumi? What are you doing here? 
Sitting here helps me remember all sorts of memories. 
You could join me, if you'd like. 
Oh, Ogami. Care to reminisce with me? 
Reminisce. 
Maybe next time. 
Sure, it's not a bad idea to take a stroll down memory lane every once in a while. 
OK, then close your eyes and try to remember everything that's happened up till now. 
Well, how was it, Ogami? 
I'll stay a little longer.
I'll come back later. 
I'll come back when I feel like reminiscing some more. 
I see. Don't hesitate to stop by. 
Man, that was really nostalgic… I think I'll reminisce a little more. 
There's nothing more precious in life than one's memories, huh? Now then, close your eyes again… 
Maybe some other time. 
I see. Don't hesitate to stop by. 
Oh, Ogami. 
Hey, Yuri. Guess you can take it easy today since you don't have work. 
Yep! I was thinking I might listen to some music. 
I know! We could listen to it together, if you'd like? 
Ah, Ogami! If you'd like, maybe we could listen to some music together? 
Listen to music. 
Maybe some other time. 
Yeah, all right, I'll listen to some while I'm here. 
OK! Pick whatever song you'd like, then. 
How was it, Ogami? Want to listen to some more? 
All right, one more time… 
Maybe some other time. 
Maybe some other time. Thanks, Yuri. 
I see. Come back anytime! 
All right, I suppose I'll listen to some more while I'm here. 
OK, got it! What song should we play next? 
I appreciate the offer, but maybe some other time. 
I see. That's too bad. 
You'll have to listen to some the next time you stop by, OK? That's a promise! 
Arf, arf! Woof! 
Oh, Ogami, is that you? 
Are you enjoying your day off too, Kaede? 
Yes. Being out in the yard like this lets me truly appreciate the spring. 
Reflecting back upon the seasons makes for a nice change of mood, you know? 
Oh, back again, Ogami? 
A change of mood might do you some good every now and then. 
Change the mood. 
Maybe next time. 
OK, I could use a little change of mood. 
All right then, just relax and embrace the seasons. 
Let's see, what mood should I go with? 
(How about this one?) 
(Should I keep it as it is?) 
Go with this mood. 
Think it over some more. 
I should give it some more thought while I have the chance. 
Well, Ogami? Feels nice to reflect upon the seasons, doesn't it? 
Yes it does! Thank you. 
Come back whenever you want a change of mood again. 
Arf, arf, arf! 
Thanks, but maybe some other time. Sorry, Kaede. 
Oh, you don't need to apologize. 
Come back whenever you feel like having a change of mood. 
Arf, arf, arf! 
Hey, Ogami. Got something nice to show ya. 
Something nice? What is it, Mr. Yoneda? 
Well, it's called the "Spirit Armor Directory." 
It's a new device that accurately recreates and plays back the movements of the Koubu Kai and Tenbu. 
Plus, thanks to the Moon Division's intel, we can also recreate the movements of the Society's Hex Mechs. 
Well, Ogami? Wanna take a look? 
Please, let me see! 
Some other time. 
That's amazing! Please, let me see! 
Heheh, all right. Take a good, hard look at these beauties! 
I'm a little busy right now, so maybe some other time. 
Oh, come on. And after I went through all that trouble explaining it. What a party pooper. 
Well, you can stop by and check out the Spirit Armor Directory whenever you want… 
So if the mood ever strikes you, come on down here sometime.
Right, understood. 
Hey, Ogami. How about taking a look at the Spirit Armory Directory? 
All right, I will. 
Some other time. 
All right, I will! 
OK then, look to your heart's content! 
I appreciate the offer, but maybe some other time. 
Jeez, such a stick in the mud. 
Well, square away some free time and come back to check it out! 
Oh, Ogami. 
If you'd like, I could broadcast whatever music you want throughout the building. 
I have three records for you, which one would you like? 
Oh, Ogami. Want to change the music playing in the theater? 
"Continuation of the Dream" 
"Theater - Daytime Theme"
"Summer Theme" 
OK then, I'll go with "Continuation of the Dream." 
"Continuation of the Dream," got it! 
Heehee, kinda feels more lively around here, now. 
OK then, I'll go with "Theater - Daytime Theme." 
“Theater - Daytime Theme,” got it! 
This really makes it feel like an ordinary day in the theater. 
OK then, I'll go with "Summer Theme." 
"Summer Theme," got it! 
A change in mood like this isn't bad every once in a while! 
Well, Ogami? Are you OK with broadcasting this song? 
Sorry, let me pick again. 
Yeah, this will do. 
Yeah, this will do. 
OK, understood! Let me know if you ever want to change it again. 
Sorry, let me pick again. 
That's all right. Which one do you want? 
Sorry, let me pick again. 
Fickle as ever, aren't you? Which one do you want? 
Hey, Tsubomi. 
Ah, Mr. Ogami! Hello! 
If you want to know what everyone’s doing on the first floor, just ask me. 
Ask about Flower Division.
Ask about everyone else.
Go somewhere else. 
You haven't seen the rest of the Flower Division, have you? 
Well, if it's a division member you're particularly close with… 
I think you might spot her if you walk around a bit on the first floor. 
Do you know what everyone outside the Flower Division is up to? 
If you go to the gift shop, Miss Tsubaki will show you some special bromides. 
Miss Kasumi and Miss Yuri are in the secretarial office… 
But I've also seen them around the stage and music room. 
All right, I'll get going. See you later, Tsubomi. 
Yes! Thank you very much! 
Are you there, sir? It's Ogami. 
Zzzz… Zzzz… 
Good grief… Sounds like he's enjoying an afternoon nap. 
I'll leave him be and not wake him up. 
Hey, Ogami. Have you tried the battle simulator yet?
I can teach ya a few tricks about fighting, if you want. 
Hey, Ogami. 
Need any tips for the battle simulator? 
Tips on how to fight well. 
High score tips.
Go somewhere else. 
Please give me some tips on how to fight well. 
The trick to fighting well rests entirely on your shoulders as captain. 
You have to use "Cover" to block enemy attacks targeting your squadmates… 
And you have to skillfully switch around your offense and defense using Captain Commands. 
You alone, Ogami, are able to take advantage of two Captain Commands in a single turn. 
For instance, you can use the "Wind" command to travel from far away… 
Then switch to the "Fire" command to attack immediately afterward. 
As with all things, you gotta be crafty. 
Please give me some tips on how to get a high score. 
Right. More than anything, don't let any of your squadmates get downed. 
If you suffer any casualties, your score will take a huge hit. 
Next, take out all the enemies as fast as you can. 
If you can meet the victory conditions as quickly as possible, your score will go up. 
For now, just keep those two things in mind. 
All right, I'll be going now. Sorry to bother you. 
Yeah. Go get some high scores! 
Looks like the entrance is locked, since it's a holiday today. 
I'll just go somewhere else. 
Oh, Kohran. What are you doing here? 
Ah, Chief? Nothing, I was just wandering around. 
Things have gotten peaceful enough where I can just relax like this. 
I'm sure that'll make Mr. Howard back in Kobe happy. 
Mr. Howard, huh? That brings me back. 
Oh yeah, we went to see him together in Kobe, huh. 
The only reason I've made it this far is because your smiling face is always there for me. 
Ogami… <br> Stay with me, forever… 
…ran… <br> Hey… Kohran. 
…Hm? 
Ch-Chief! Sorry, guess I was spacing out a bit. 
Ahahaha, what's the matter, Kohran? 
Chief… 
…Hm? What, is there something on my face? 
N-Nope, it's nothing! 
R-Right, well, I gotta get going. Later, Chief! 
Did my smiling creep her out or something? 
…Oh well. I'll just get going. 
Doesn't look like Kohran's here anymore. 
Oh well. I'll go somewhere else. 
Looks like there's no one here. 
I've got plenty of time to kill, so I'll just wander around some more. 
Ah, Ogami! 
Hey, Sakura. What are you up to? 
I was just cleaning up the prop room. 
I see. You really like doing housework, don't you, Sakura? 
You even made me breakfast when I went to visit your family. 
Heehee, that did happen, didn't it? 
We could only stay in Sendai for a short while, but it was so much fun… 
… 
…Sakura? <br> What's the matter? 
Ah! 
Oh… Oh gosh… <br> I'm sorry, Ogami. 
W-Well I have to get going now. 
Look forward to some tasty miso soup, OK? 
…Miso soup? She was just cleaning, why is she talking about miso soup now? 
Doesn't look like Sakura's here anymore. 
Oh well. I'll go somewhere else. 
Nobody here in the kitchen. 
There's still time before we have to eat. I'll head somewhere else. 
Oh, if it isn't Kanna. 
Hey, Boss. Heh, I was gettin’ kinda hungry. 
Feels like I can finally relax now that our spring production's wrapped. 
You had two big roles back to back between the Christmas and spring plays. 
The Christmas play, huh? 
Heheh, now I feel kinda nostalgic. 
Back then, I was so conflicted over whether or not I could play the lead role. 
I was so nervous, readin’ that script the night before I got picked… 
It's all thanks to you, Boss, that I was able to take the stage as the star of the Christmas play. 
Thank you, Boss. It really means a lot to me. 
…Kanna? What's up? 
…H-Huh? Where… am I? 
What do you mean, where? This is the kitchen. 
Ah… Ahaha… <br> Y-Yeah, you're right. 
W-Welp, I gotta go. Seeya, Boss! 
Kanna… <br> What was up with her? 
I thought she came here to get something to eat… 
Doesn't look like Kanna's here. 
Oh well, guess I should go to another room. 
Nobody here in the lobby. It is a holiday, I suppose. 
No use sticking around. I'll go somewhere else. 
Oh, Captain. 
Hey, Maria. Where are you going? 
I'm just taking a stroll around the theater, like you, Captain… 
Reminiscing about the past year all the while. 
I see… 
That reminds me of the time we all went to Atami on vacation. 
Yes, I remember that well. 
We were trapped in that cave together… 
I decided I would stay behind. 
But then you told me you weren't going to leave me. 
… 
…Maria? What's the matter? 
Hm hm… It's nothing. 
Well then, Captain, I'll be going now. 
Let's both enjoy our day off. 
Yeah. See you later, Maria. 
Maria seemed lost in thought about something that whole time. 
Must've been reminiscing like she mentioned before. 
Looks like Maria's already gone somewhere else. 
Oh well, guess I should go to another room. 
Figures nobody'd be here today, since it's a holiday and all. 
Oh well, I'll go somewhere else. 
Oh, Captain… 
Hey, Reni. What are you up to? 
I was reflecting on some things. 
Like when I first stood upon this stage, for instance. 
Right, that was for "The Blue Bird," wasn't it? 
… 
Back then… You and all the others… You taught me something. 
To fight for myself… To fight for the ones I love. 
… 
Captain… Thank you. 
Huh? 
Well… I'll be going now. 
…? 
Did I do anything worth being thanked for just now…? 
Doesn't look like Reni's here anymore. 
No use staying here. I'll go somewhere else. 
It's our day off, so there's not a single customer in sight. 
Right, I've got plenty of time still. Where to next? 
Hey Iris, were you out just now? 
Yep, I was sending a letter to my papa and mama! 
Hahaha, I see. That reminds me of when we went to go see them. 
Heheh, I remember that too! 
… 
… 
…Iris? Hey, what's wrong? 
H-Huh? 
Oh… S-Sorry, Mon Frère! 
I was just thinking about some stuff… 
Oh? What kind of stuff? C'mon, tell me. 
Heheheh. <br> That’s… a… secret!
I'm gonna go now, Mon Frère. Bye-bye! 
Hmm, I wonder what she was thinking about. 
Well, no use staying here, at any rate. I'll go somewhere else. 
Iris isn't here anymore. 
Oh well. Guess I'll get going. 
Nobody here in the dressing room, since it's our day off. 
Oh well. I'll go somewhere else. 
Huh? What are you up to, Orihime? 
That voice… <br> Is that you, Mr. Ensign? 
I was just stretching my legs on top of the tatami. 
These tatami mats, they feel great once you are used to them. 
That sounds nice. I think I'll stretch my legs a bit too. 
Still, I remember, back when you first got here… 
You didn’t have a lot of nice things to say about tatami mats. 
Come now, that was so long ago! How very mean you are, Mr. Ensign. 
Hahaha, you've sure changed a lot over the past year, Orihime. 
Now that you mention it… <br> Maybe you are right. 
…Orihime? 
… 
That reminds me, back when Papa and Mamma came to visit… 
…hime… <br> Orihime… 
…Hm? 
Ah! Wh-Where am I? 
Seems like the tatami mat felt so good you dozed off for a second. 
I see… <br> So that was… a dream. 
…A dream? What kind of dream were you having? 
I-I am not telling! 
W-Well, I have places to be, so I have to get going! 
Right… <br> She sure left in a huff. 
I wonder what she was dreaming about… 
Orihime's not here anymore. 
Oh well. Guess I'll head somewhere else. 
Nobody here in the wardrobe room, since it's our day off. 
Oh well. I'll go somewhere else. 
… 
Sumire? 
Ensign? 
Pardon me, Ensign. 
I was just looking at this costume and thinking back to our summer production. 
Our summer production, huh? That was right after we barged into your family’s estate. 
Yes… 
… 
Sumire? You've been quiet for a long time. What's wrong? 
…Huh? 
O-Oh my… <br> What's come over me? 
I was simply lost in thought… I do apologize. 
What were you thinking about? 
N-Nothing at all! 
Now I must be going. <br> Good day! 
…? <br> What's up with Sumire? 
Doesn't look like Sumire's here anymore. 
Oh well. I'll go somewhere else. 
Oh, Ogami. 
Hey Sakura, thought I'd come hang out. 
I'm sorry, Ogami. I know you went out of your way to come see me… 
But I'm in the middle of writing a letter to my mother. 
I see. That's OK. I'll come back some other time. 
I'm sorry. Let's practice our swordplay next time. 
Sakura? It's Ogami. 
Sorry, Ogami. I'm in the middle of writing a letter. 
I see… Oh well, then. 
Ah, Ogami, you're here! 
Yeah. I'm not interrupting anything, am I? 
No, not at all. I've been waiting for you, actually. 
I was thinking we could head to the yard and practice our swordplay. Want to come along? 
Oh, Ogami. 
Hey Sakura, thought I'd come hang out. 
Perfect timing. I was just about to go to the yard for some sword practice. 
You could come join me, if you'd like? 
Ah, Ogami, perfect timing. 
Care to join me again for some sword practice? 
Join her for practice. 
Recall past practice. 
Maybe next time. 
Yeah, sure. If you don't mind, then I'd love to join you. 
You would? Thank you! 
Right then, let's head to the yard right away. 
Nice job, Ogami. You were a great help. 
Join her for practice. 
Recall past practice. 
Go somewhere else. 
If you don't mind, then I can stick around for some more practice. 
Really? Thank you! 
OK then, please stick around! 
(Training with Sakura was rough, but a lot of fun…) 
Ogami? Is there something wrong? 
No, I was just thinking about that time we trained before. 
You really went for it, didn't you, Sakura? 
Oh, not at all. It's just that you and I were in perfect sync. 
All right, I have to get going. Nice job, Sakura. 
Thank you so much! <br> Stop by again sometime! 
(Training with Sakura was rough, but a lot of fun…) 
Ogami? Is there something wrong? 
No, I was just thinking about that time we trained before. 
You really went for it, didn't you, Sakura? 
Oh, not at all. It's just that you and I were in perfect sync. 
I appreciate the offer, but maybe next time. Sorry, Sakura. 
I see… Well, stop by again sometime. 
Oh my, Ensign… 
Hey, Sumire, thought I'd come hang out. 
My apologies, but I have matters to attend to. 
…"Matters"? What would those happen to be? 
Hmhm, I'm afraid I can't say. 
Now then, Ensign, if you'll please excuse me. 
Hmm… Well, if she's busy, then so be it. 
Sumire… 
… 
Doesn't look like she's here. She did say she had matters to attend to. I'll go elsewhere. 
Oh, Ensign, welcome. 
Hey, Sumire, thought I'd come hang out. 
My apologies, I was just about to head to the stage… 
The stage? For dance practice, I take it? 
…! <br> Th-That's not… 
Hey, Sumire, thought I'd come hang out. 
Oh, my apologies, I was just about to head to the stage… 
The stage? For dance practice, I take it? 
…! <br> Th-That's not… 
Hey, Sumire, need help with your dance practice? 
…Well, no use hiding it now that you've found out. 
Help Sumire practice. 
Reminisce on her dancing.
Go somewhere else. 
If you don't mind, Sumire, I could help you with your practice. 
Nothing gets past you, does it, Ensign? 
Very well, then. <br> Now, Ensign… <br> If you'd be so kind. 
Thank you very much for your assistance, Ensign. 
Join her for practice. 
Recall past practice. 
Go somewhere else. 
If you want, I could practice with you some more. 
Are you sure? It's your day off, after all. 
Yeah, don't worry about it. Besides, I've gotten pretty good at controlling the lights. 
Ohohohoho… <br> Well then, if you insist. 
(Sumire sure looked beautiful dancing in the spotlight…) 
What's the matter, Ensign? You seem to be in a trance.
…N-No, it's nothing. 
Could it be you were daydreaming of my beautiful dancing figure? 
You… <br> Yeah, you nailed it. 
Ohohoho… <br> I've learned a lot about you these past two years, Ensign. 
All right, I'm gonna get going. Nice job, Sumire. 
Remember, these practice sessions are our secret.
(Sumire sure was pretty dancing in the spotlight…) 
What's the matter, Ensign? You look to be in a trance.
…N-No, it's nothing. 
… You look like you're busy, so I'm gonna head out. 
Thank you for being so considerate, Ensign… 
Oh, Captain. 
Hey, Maria. Thought I'd come hang out. 
Apologies, sir, but I was in the middle of reading… 
I… I see. Sorry to bother you. 
No, I'm sorry to waste your time after having come here. 
Maybe we can go shopping later when we've got the time. 
It's Ogami. 
Apologies, Captain. I'm still reading. 
I… I see. Oh well. 
Hey, Maria. Thought I'd come hang out. 
Oh, Captain. 
Hm hm… I was actually reading through my diary just now. 
I wrote about the time we went out shopping together in the rain… That really brings back memories. 
Oh yeah, that did happen, didn't it? 
Hey, Maria. Doing some reading? 
Yes, I suppose you could call it that. I was going through my diary. 
Hm hm… I even wrote about the time we went shopping together in the rain. 
Oh yeah, that did happen, didn't it? 
Hey, Maria. Reading through your diary still? 
Yes. I want these good memories to last, no matter how much time has passed. 
Recall the shopping trip. 
Remember how Maria looked.
Go somewhere else. 
That's right, we walked all the way back to the theater with only one umbrella to share between us. 
Yeah, the memories of that time are all coming back to me… 
Captain? What's the matter? 
Oh, sorry. I was just thinking about that time myself. 
Hm hm, I see. 
It was careless of us to bring only one umbrella… 
But because of that, we got to make some nice memories. 
Talk about the trip more. 
Recall how Maria looked.
Go somewhere else. 
How about we talk about that time we went shopping some more? 
All right, sure. Today's our day off, so you can stay as long as you'd like. 
Hm hm, what a fun memory. 
I'd love to go shopping with you again sometime. 
Sure. We can go whenever you'd like. 
You looked really pretty after we got out of that rain, Maria. 
C-Captain! Please don't bring that up. 
Hahaha, why not? It was another nice memory. 
All right, I'd better get going. See you, Maria. 
Yes, sir. Thank you for taking the time to see me. 
You looked really pretty after we got out of that rain, Maria. 
C-Captain! Please don't bring that up. 
Hahaha, why not? It was another nice memory. 
All right, I'd better get going. See you, Maria. 
Yes, sir. Thank you for taking the time to see me. 
Well if it ain't the boss! 
Hey, Kanna. Thought I'd come hang out. 
Sorry, Boss. I was just about to head down to the exercise room to practice my karate. 
I see… Sorry to bother you, then. 
Sorry, Boss. 
It's Ogami… 
… 
Doesn't look like she's here. Oh well, guess I'll go somewhere else. 
Hey, Boss! Ya here to hang out? 
Yeah, it's my day off, so I've got time. What were you up to just now? 
Heh, I was just thinkin' about the past for a change. 
Like that time you and I had to climb through the attic to fix the roof. 
Man, that was fun. I still think about it every now and then. 
Hey Kanna, thought I'd come hang out. What are you up to? 
Heh, I was just thinkin' about the past for a change. 
Like that time you and I had to climb through the attic to fix the roof. 
Man, that was fun. I still think about it every now and then. 
Hey, Boss. Back again? 
Yeah, just kinda wandered in here. 
Heh, wanna climb up on the roof again while you're here? 
Recall repairing the roof. 
Remember how Kanna looked.
Go somewhere else. 
Now that you mention it, there was that one time we had to run through the attic together… 
You should tag along again the next time I go up to fix the roof! 
Haha, all right, sure. 
Think back once more. 
Recall how Kanna looked.
Go somewhere else. 
It was pretty grueling, but still fun. 
We made it up to the roof after we got through the attic. 
Nothin’ beats lyin’ on the roof and lookin’ up at the sky, huh? 
When ya got time, Boss, we should climb up there again. 
All right, I should get going. Later, Kanna. 
Gotcha. Come back and hang sometime! 
We made it up to the roof after we got through the attic.

Ah, Mon frère! 
Hey Iris, I'm here to play. 
Sorry, Mon Frère, but I'm studying right now. 
We'll have plenty of time to play when I'm all done! 
R-Right… Sorry for interrupting your studies. 
Well then, keep studying hard, Iris. 
OK! Sorry, Mon Frère! 
(Iris said she was studying…) 
(I shouldn't bother her. Guess I'll go somewhere else.) 
Ah, Mon Frère! <br> You're gonna play with me?! 
Yeah. What are you up to? 
I was just organizing all the pictures you took of me. 
I even found pictures from that time we went to the festival! 
Hey Iris, I'm here to play. 
Ah, Mon Frère! You came at just the right time! 
I was just organizing all the pictures you took of me. 
I even found pictures from that time we went to the festival! 
Hey, Iris. Still organizing those photos? 
Yup! I've got a whole bunch, you know! 
Remember the festival.  
Ask to see the photo. 
Go somewhere else. 
Oh yeah, you brought me along to go see all those stalls. 
Eheheh! It was so much fun, huh, Mon Frère! 
A little exhausting, but yeah. 
I had soooo much fun! 
I hope we can go together again someday! 
Remember the festival.  
Ask to see the photo. 
Go somewhere else. 
Let me think back on the festival one more time… 
Iris, could you show me the picture from the festival? 
OK, sure! <br> Here you go. 
Eheheh… <br> I feel kind of embarrassed. 
You don't have to, this is a great picture of you. 
Really? Thank you, Mon Frère. 
All right, I should get going. See you later, Iris. 
OK! Bye-bye, Mon Frère! 
Iris, could you show me the picture from the festival? 
OK, sure! <br> Here you go. 
Eheheh… <br> I feel kind of embarrassed. 
You don't have to, this is a great picture of you. 
Really? Thank you, Mon Frère. 
All right, I should get going. See you later, Iris. 
OK! Bye-bye, Mon Frère! 
Oh, Chief, I was wondering who that was. 
Hey, Kohran. Thought I'd come hang out. 
You came at just the right time! I'm about to take my newest invention out for a test drive. 
…Wanna be my guinea pig, Chief? 
Eep?! <br> G-Guinea pig?! 
Relax, it's fine! Even if it blows up, you'll just get covered in soot at worst. 
Getting covered in soot is bad enough as it is! 
Actually, I just remembered, there's something urgent I have to do, so… Later, Kohran! 
Ah, Chief! <br> W-Wait a second! 
(Seemed like Kohran was in the middle of inventing something.) 
(She'll make me her guinea pig if I just wander in there… I should go somewhere else.) 
Hey Chief! Here to hang out? 
Yeah, it's my day off and all, plus I just wanted to talk to you. 
Now that the fighting's over, the Koubu are also taking a much-needed break. 
Looks like I'll be spending my time in the garden for a while, then. 
I'll be able to grow some yummy tomatoes for you by summer, Chief. 
Hey, Kohran. Thought I'd come hang out. 
Great timing, Chief. <br> I've also got time to kill. 
Now that the fighting's over, the Koubu are also taking a much-needed break. 
Looks like I'll be spending my time in the garden for a while, then. 
I'll be able to grow some yummy tomatoes for you by summer, Chief. 
Oh, Chief. Back so soon? 
Wanted to talk some more about that time we harvested those tomatoes? 
Think back on the harvest. 
Recall how Kohran looked.
Go somewhere else. 
Oh yeah, last summer there was that time we harvested tomatoes while fighting off those crows.
It was pretty hectic, but that kind of work's not so bad every now and then. 
We'll have another battle against the crows later this year! They're not getting any of my veggies! 
Think back once more. 
Recall how Kohran looked.
Go somewhere else. 
Let me think back on that one more time… 
I can still remember how much you smiled while we were harvesting those tomatoes… 
Aw, cut it out, Chief. You remember the weirdest things. 
Hahaha, what, it's a nice memory.
…You're right. Here's to growing more nice tomatoes together, Chief. 
I should get going. Thanks for having me over, Kohran. 
Come back to hang out whenever you like! 
I can still remember how much you smiled while we were harvesting those tomatoes…

Hahaha, what, it's a nice memory. 
…You're right. Here's to growing more nice tomatoes together, Chief. 
I should get going. Thanks for having me over, Kohran. 
Come back to hang out whenever you like! 
Oh, Mr. Ensign. Did you need something? 
I have the day off, so I thought I'd stop by and chat with you. 
Actually… I was just about to take my siesta. 
“Siesta"…? <br> Oh, you're going to take a nap, huh? 
I'm sorry. Stop by some other time, OK? 
Orihime? It's Ogami. 
Zzzz… Zzzz… 
Sounds like she's already started napping. 
Hi, Orihime. 
Oh, Mr. Ensign! Are you here to visit? 
Just now, I am about to go down to play the piano. Want to join me? 
Hey, Orihime. Thought I'd come hang out. 
You look like you have a lot of free time on your hands, as usual. 
Oh, just now, I am about to go down to play the piano. Want to join me? 
Oh, Mr. Ensign. <br> You're back? 
If you've got time to kill, then how about we go play some piano? 
Go together. 
Remember Orihime's playing.
Go somewhere else. 
If you'll have me, I'd love to. 
OK, let's go to the music room right away! 
(Oh yeah, there was that time Orihime tried to test my musical aptitude.) 
(That was… Last summer, right?) 
… 
(I can't believe it's already been half a year since then…) 
Mr. Ensiiiign? Are you listening to my piano playing? 
Y-Yeah, I'm listening. 
Remember the music test. 
Look at Orihime. 
Go somewhere else. 
(I can still remember it clearly…) 
… 
Mr. Ensign, you have seemed distracted for quite a while now. Are you even listening to me?! 
I-I was just caught up in your piano playing, Orihime… 
…Really, now? Well, I guess that's fine. 
… 
… 
(I can still picture how Orihime looked back then…) 
Lala… Lala… <br> Lalala… 
(Orihime didn't listen to me very much back then…) 
(But she looked just as serious playing the piano as she does now…) 
I hate to leave in the middle of your performance, but I have to get going. 
If you're leaving, then I'll be leaving as well. 
Let's come back here again sometime! 
Yeah, I'm looking forward to it. 
(Even looking at her like this, I can picture her playing the piano…) 
…Mr. Ensign? You've been dead silent ever since you got here. Is there something wrong?
…Oh, sorry, my bad. Just spaced out a bit. 
Feeling listless now that the battle's over, is that it? 
Maybe listening to me play the piano will make for a nice change of pace. 
I'll be going now. Sorry to disturb you, Orihime. 
Come on! You might as well listen to me play while you're here! 
S-Sorry… I'm busy with other stuff… 
…Well, make room in your schedule to hear me play for the next time. Got it?!  
Captain… 
Hey Reni. Thought I'd come hang out. 
…Sorry. I'm about to go take a bath. 
O-Oh… Can't exactly join you for that one, can I? 
All right, take it easy, then. Later, Reni. 
…OK. Sorry, Captain. 
It's Ogami… 
… 
Looks like she's not back yet. I'll go somewhere else. 
Captain… 
Hey, Reni. <br> Going somewhere? 
Yeah. I was just about to head to the pool for my swimming practice. 
…Will you be coming too? 
Captain… 
Hey, Reni. <br> Going somewhere? 
Yeah. I was just about to head to the pool for my swimming practice. 
…Will you be coming too? 
Hey, Reni. Going to the pool again? 
Yeah. Will you be coming too, Captain? 
Go swimming. 
Recall Reni's swimsuit.
Go somewhere else. 
OK, today's my day off, so I'm ready to swim my heart out! 
…OK. <br> Let's go, Captain. 
Phew… <br> That was refreshing. 
Are you not going to swim more, Captain? 
Swim some more. 
Look at Reni. 
Go somewhere else. 
I'm still going! I'm ready to swim all day! 
Good luck, Captain. 
(Reni in her bathing suit…) 
Captain… What are you staring at? 
Uh… N-Nothing, nothing at all, Reni. 
All right, I'm gonna go now. Nice job, Reni. 
OK. See you later, Captain. 
(Reni sure was cute in that swimsuit…) 
…What's the matter, Captain? 
Uh… S-Sorry, I just remembered how you looked in that bathing suit. 
Ah… I-I see. 
All right, I'm gonna go now. Nice job, Reni. 
OK. See you later, Captain. 
Oh, Ogami. 
Hey, Tsubaki. What are you doing in a place like this? 
I figured, since we're on break today, you and I could play a game… 
So I've prepared a quiz, just for you, Ogami! 
Wanna see if you can answer 10 questions correctly in a row? 
Oh, Ogami! You're back! 
Would you like to give my quiz a try? 
All right, let's do it! 
…Maybe next time. 
Sounds like fun. <br> All right, let's do it! 
That's the spirit! OK, Ogami, here goes! 
I appreciate it, but maybe next time. 
Huh? You're leaving? Boriiing. 
You've got to play with me some other time, then, OK? 
Well, Ogami? Are you giving up, or do you want to try again? 
I'll keep going! 
…I'll come back later. 
I'll keep going! Hit me with the questions, Tsubaki! 
OK! Well then, here we go! 
…I give up. <br> I'll come back later. 
…I see. Come back and try again when you feel like it. 
Wow! You got them all right! 
Hahaha, somehow. 
OK then, Ogami, please go to the attic next. 
…The attic? <br> What's up there? 
Heheh, that's a secret! All right, come back and play again sometime! 
Wow! You got them all right! 
These questions are probably too easy for you, huh? 
Still, they're a lot of fun. 
Heh, thank you! 
Come back and play again sometime, Ogami! 
Ah, Ogami! Hm hm, I've been waiting for you. 
Hey, Yuri. Need me for something? 
This is your first day off in a while, right? I thought we could play a game together… 
So I've prepared a 10-question battle quiz, just for you, Ogami! 
Ready to put your pride on the line as the Flower Division's captain? 
Ah, Ogami! You came back! 
Want to give my battle quiz a shot? 
All right, let's do it! 
…Maybe next time. 
Sounds like fun. <br> All right, let's do it! 
Hm hm, got it. <br> OK, then… Here we go! 
I appreciate it, but maybe next time. 
Jeez, Ogami! I went to the trouble of preparing a quiz for you but now you're leaving me high and dry! 
Next time you come here, you gotta give it a try, OK? 
Well, Ogami? Are you giving up, or do you want to try again? 
I'll keep going! 
…I'll come back later. 
I can keep going! Keep the questions coming, Yuri! 
That’s the Ogami I know! You've got guts! OK, here they come! 
…I give up. <br> I'll come back later. 
Huhhh? Quitting already? 
Next time you stop by, I want you to give the quiz a serious shot, OK? 
You did it, Ogami! You answered every question correctly! 
Hahaha, thanks. 
Of course, these are only beginner-level questions, Ogami. 
If you want to give the advanced-level questions a try, head up to the terrace. 
So there's advanced-level questions too, huh? OK, I'll give it a shot! 
Good luck! <br> I'm rooting for you! 
That's the Ogami I know! You got them all right! 
This level of quiz is too easy for you at this point, huh? 
Still, they're a lot of fun. 
Really? Thank you! 
Come back and play again sometime, Ogami! 
It's feeling more and more like spring lately with the sun out like this… 
Today's looking like it'll be a great holiday with pleasant weather. 
Oh… Kasumi? 
It seems as though you've cleared Yuri's beginner-level battle quiz. 
I've prepared an even harder combat quiz for you. 
Would you like to see if you can answer 10 of my questions correctly in a row? 
Oh, Ogami, you're back. 
Would you like to try the advance-level battle quiz? 
All right, let's do it! 
…Maybe next time. 
Sounds like fun. <br> All right, let's do it! 
OK, understood. I've got some challenging questions prepared for you, so get ready! 
Right, then… Let's begin. 
I appreciate it, but maybe next time. 
I see. Understood. 
Don't hesitate to visit whenever you feel like giving it a try. 
Giving up already, Ogami? Or would you like to try again? 
I'll keep going! 
…I'll come back later. 
I'll keep going! Keep the questions coming, Kasumi! 
OK, understood. Right, then, without further ado, here they come. 
…I give up. <br> I'll come back later. 
Hm hm, I won this round. 
Come back to challenge me again whenever you like. 
Amazing, Ogami! <br> You got them all right. 
Phew… Looks like I managed to defend my honor as captain of the Flower Division. 
Now then, Ogami, please make your way to Kaede's room. 
Kaede's room? Is there another quiz after this? 
Hm hm, you'll just have to go and find out! 
Splendid as always, Ogami. You got them all right. 
Thank you, Kasumi. I had a lot of fun, thanks to you.
No, thank YOU for coming here to play. 
Feel free to visit again whenever you want, OK? 
Nobody's here… 
No use sticking around. I'll go somewhere else. 
Huh? Nobody's here. 
Tsubaki told me to come here, though… That's odd. 
Yo, Ogami! <br> I've been waiting for you! 
Th-That voice… Kayama?! 
Haha, indeed! Alley-OOP! 
Seeing you here must mean you've passed Tsubaki's quiz! 
However, Ogami, Tsubaki's quiz was merely beginner-level questions. 
Think you can handle these stumpers prepared for you by the Moon Division recon unit? 
Yo, Ogami. Back again, I see? 
Ahh, what a joy it is to spend a holiday together with you like this… 
Right then, Ogami. Are you ready to take on my advanced-level 10-question quiz? 
Of course I am! 
…Maybe next time. 
Of course I am! 
Good. That right there is why you're the Flower Division’s captain. 
Well then, Ogami… <br> Here I come! 
I appreciate it, but maybe next time. 
C-Come on, now, Ogami! You're leaving without answering a single question?! 
Yeah, not really in the mood. I'll do it some other time. 
I-I see… And here I was, raring to go… 
I'll be waiting for you here, Ogami. Come back whenever you please! 
Giving up already? Or would you like to try again? 
I'm just getting started! 
…I'll come back later. 
I'm just getting started! <br> Bring it on, Kayama! 
Well said, Ogami! All right then, without further ado, here goes! 
…I give up. <br> I'll come back later. 
“Not knowing is a temporary shame; not learning, an eternal one." 
Even if you can't answer 10 questions in a row correctly right now, I know you can eventually. 
Come back and try again at any time, Ogami. I'll be waiting for you. 
Well done, Ogami! You passed the advanced-level quiz with flying colors! 
All right, I did it! 
You've done well to make it this far, Ogami, so I have a present for you. 
Go to the salon. You'll find a fun way to pass the time waiting for you there. 
A fun way to pass the time? 
Heh, you'll find out once you get there! Well then, Ogami, till we meet again! 
Just as I'd expect from you, Ogami. Nothing more needs to be said. 
Well, if you ever feel like challenging my quiz again, come back anytime. 
Sure. Thanks, Kayama. 
Come, now, no need to thank me. A diversion like this on a day off isn't so bad. 
Well then, Ogami, till we meet again! 
Nobody here in the salon. 
Thought everyone would be here, since we have the day off, but I guess not. 
Wha-What are you all doing here? 
Ah, Ogami. Will you be joining us for cards? 
Cards? 
You came 'round to all our rooms earlier and called for us, right? 
But when we opened our doors, there was nobody there! Are you perhaps a ninja, Mr. Ensign? 
(I get it… This must be Kayama's doing.) 
OK, since everyone's here already, let's play some cards. 
Yaaay, yaaay! <br> I'll go get some sweets from my room! 
In that case, I'll brew us a delicious pot of tea. 
It's not every day we have the time to play together like this. 
Just know that I won't lose. 
Awright! Let's get started already! 
Nice job, Ogami. 
If you ever want to play cards again, just come to the salon. 
Hey guys. So this is where you've been. 
We've been waiting for you, Ogami. Let's play cards together. 
We've been waiting for you, Ensign. How about a game of cards with everyone? 
Captain, seeing as we're on holiday, how about we all play cards together for a change? 
We've been waitin' for ya, Boss! Since we're all here now, how's about a game of cards? 
We've been waiting for you, Mon Frère! C'mon, let's play cards already! 
We've been waiting for you, Chief! C'mon, let's hop to it and play some cards! 
Mr. Ensign, we've been waiting! Now, let us all play cards together! 
Apparently we're just about to play some cards. Will you join us, Captain? 
All right, let's do it! 
Some other time… 
OK! Go easy on me, will you? 
Observe my brilliant card-playing skills! 
Hm hm… Just so you know, I won't go down easily. 
Heheh, that's what I'm talkin' 'bout! OK, but just lettin' ya know, I'm gonna win this thing! 
Eheheh! <br> I'm not gonna lose! 
All right! Just so you know, I'm not gonna hold back! 
Europe is the home of card games. I'll show you my true skill! 
Even in play, there is strategy. Know that I won't lose. 
Nice job, Ogami. 
If you ever want to play cards again, just come to the salon. 
I appreciate it, but maybe some other time… 
Huh?! You're not gonna play with us, Mon Frère?! Boooriiiing! 
Iris, I'm sure Ogami's busy with a lot of things right now. 
Well then, Ogami, if you ever feel like playing cards, just come to the salon. 
Kaede? It's Ogami… 
… 
Looks like she's not in. 
Oh, Ogami, is that you? 
You must've beaten Kasumi's quiz if you've come here. 
Y-Yes. 
Very well. <br> OK then, follow me, Ogami. 
Why on earth did she bring me all the way to the command room? 
Sorry to keep you waiting, Ogami. 
Kaede?! What in the world… 
Hm hm, sorry to surprise you like this. 
The truth is, we've added a battle simulator to the command room. 
Now you'll be able to practice all kinds of battle scenarios. 
Wow… Th-That's amazing. 
It can even keep score. Truly an amazing machine. Well, will you give it a shot? 
Try it out. 
Maybe next time. 
OK, I'll try it out! 
Good answer, Ogami. I thought you'd say that. 
Well then, take all the time you want, and enjoy. 
I appreciate the offer, but maybe some other time. 
Oh, I see… <br> And after all the trouble we went through to set it up, too. What a shame. 
Well, if you ever change your mind, come to my room. 
OK, understood. Thank you very much. 
Oh, Ogami. Would you like to use the battle simulator? 
Use it. 
Maybe next time. 
Yes, ma'am! I'd like to use it. 
Understood. Right, then, come with me to the command room. 
I appreciate the offer, but maybe some other time. 
Oh… Was I mistaken? 
…Very well, then. If you ever do feel like using it… 
Stop by my room at any time. 
Hey, Tsubomi. 
Ah, Mr. Ogami! Hello! 
If there's anything you'd like to know about the second floor, just ask! 
Ask about Flower Division.
Ask about everyone else. 
Go somewhere else. 
You haven't seen the rest of the Flower Division, have you? 
Everyone ought to be in their rooms right now. 
Since you have the day off today, you could go play games with them… 
…or simply reminiscing with everyone might be fun, too. 
What's everyone else doing? 
Right, they said they were getting quizzes ready for you. 
If you can beat all the quizzes, then the Flower Division… 
Ah, whoops! I'm not supposed to share that!
I'm sorry, Mr. Ogami. I can't tell you anything more, since it's a secret and all. 
N-Now I'm getting a little concerned… C'mon, tell me, Tsubomi. 
Smile, smile! 
Hey, Tsubomi. <br> About earlier… 
Smile, smile! 
Sheesh… Doesn't look like I'll be getting anything out of her. 
Ah, Ogami! You solved everyone's quizzes! 
Congratulations! 
Thank you. It made for a fun holiday. 
All right, I'll get going. See you later, Tsubomi. 
Thanks! Please come again! 
Well, if it isn't Ichiro! Did you come to see lil' ol' me? 
Enough, Yokihiko! I told you not to cause a scene now that we're above ground! 
H-He's right, Yokihiko… <br> You're embarrassing us… 
By the way, Ensign Ogami. It's your first day off in a long while, right? 
I'm sure you have a lot of games to play with the rest of the Flower Division today… 
But we of the Rose Division, the secret unit of love and beauty, have acquired some useful intel. 
Oh my, Ichiro, it looks like you don't have any memories of playing with the others. 
That's unfortunate… That means there's nothing we can do to help you, then… 
If the opportunity ever arises again, try playing with the other members of the Flower Division, OK? 
Right, understood. 
Ask any one of us and we’ll share some info with you! 
Oh, Ensign Ogami. Have you come to hear our intel? 
Ask Kotone. 
Ask Yokihiko. 
Ask Kikunojo. 
All right, then… Kotone, if you'd be so kind. 
Hm hm, a man of taste, I see. I'll tell you my top secret info. 
…Or rather, I would, but none of my intel would be of any use to you right now. 
We all need to take detours in life. You need to get out there and create some more memories. 
O-OK… 
First, I'll tell you some tips on sword training with Sakura. 
When two bundles fly out at the same time, that's your chance for a simultaneous strike. 
Cutting them all at the same time is impressive, but the risk of missing them is also quite high. 
If you want to consistently seize victory, your best bet is to cut every bundle that flies out. 
If you can strike three simultaneously, you'll get a "Lightning Cut" point bonus. 
That's the key to Sakura's sword training. 
If you're helping Sumire practice her dancing… 
Fundamentally, all you have to do is keep Sumire lit with the spotlight kept small. 
However, when presented with a "Light-up Chance," you should shine the big spotlight on her. 
Sumire's mood will gradually worsen if you don't keep the spotlight on her… 
So do your best to direct the spotlight while also managing her mood. 
Right… That should do it for Sumire's practice. 
Now, for going out shopping with Maria… 
You'll want to stay out of the water, which means changing the direction of your umbrella often. 
When you see "!", that means a tailwind's coming up, so try to catch it whenever you can. 
Remembering when the tailwinds appear is one of several potential strategies. 
Do your best to not let Maria get soaked. 
That's all for Maria's shopping trip. 
All right, then… Yokihiko, if you'd be so kind. 
You've got it! I'll tell you my special tips! 
…Oh dear! Seems like my info's useless to you! 
Look, Ichiro, I understand that you’d want to beeline things… 
But you have to look after the other members of the Flower Division more, OK? 
O-OK… 
OK, first, here's some tips for when you go to the attic with Kanna. 
Kanna’s super fast, sure, but she can't do it alone. She needs your powerful jumping abilities, Ichiro.
If you ever think an area's too much for you, you can switch places right away! 
You can even swap out in the middle of a jump or while falling. Skillful swapping will take you far! 
Also, it's probably a good idea to pick up any screws you see, even if it means taking a little detour! 
That should do it whenever you're with Kanna. 
Here's some tips for when you're bringing Iris around to the festival stalls. 
Make careful use of walking and running to slip through the gaps between people. 
When the parade passes through, make sure Iris sees it toot-sweet! 
That's right, as time passes, you'll see people with all kinds of movement patterns come out. 
Just keep your eyes peeled and keep Iris entertained, okey-dokey? 
I think that's about it for visiting the stalls with Iris. 
Let's see now, tips for harvesting tomatoes with Kohran… 
Whenever you take out a crow with a smoke bomb, it'll envelop nearby crows one by one.
If they're flying in formation, hit the lead crow and the rest will get enveloped automatically! 
The crows have all kinds of movement patterns, so be careful, OK? 
If you can save all the tomatoes or get rid of all the crows, you'll get a whole bunch of points! 
I think that should do it for the tomato harvesting. 
All right, then… Kikunojo, if you'd be so kind. 
O-OK! Understood. 
Oh, oh my… I don't think any of my information will be of any use to you just yet… 
I'm sorry I can't be of any help… 
U-Um, right… How about when you're listening to Orihime playing the piano…? 
If you have improper notes in front of you, you need to think carefully about moving them up or down.
Even when they're lined up vertically, arrange them to be horizontal. That'll make things easier. 
Also, the "#" and “♭” won't reach all the way to the end, so do be careful about that. 
Count how many notes of the same color are coming, then move them only as much as is necessary.
That's all I know about Orihime's piano playing. 
Here's some advice for when you're joining Reni for her aquatic training… 
The mines in the pool will increase in number the more targets you pick up. 
If all you do is aim for the easy targets, you won't get high marks from Reni, either… 
Going for the fast-moving targets will get you higher ratings from her, so do your best… 
Also, when surrounded by mines, it might be easier to escape if you just stay still for a bit…
That's all the information I have about Reni's aquatic training. 
Ask for more info. 
Go somewhere else. 
Um… Do you have any other information to share with me? 
Yes, of course. Who would you like to hear about? 
Thank you very much. <br> I have to get going now. 
Come by whenever you'd like to hear any more intel. 
Phew… Nothing's more relaxing than being in your own room…
