We managed to escape from the theater somehow. 
I wonder if everyone is OK... 
Come on, of course they are. I'm sure they're driving those soldiers out of the theater as we speak. 
Yeah…
...Sakura. 
Are you still thinking about what the manager said?
Yes, I... 
... 
Sakura... 
O-Ogami... 
... 
I’m here with you.
I wonder who's meeting us.
Sakura… I’m here with you. You don’t have to worry about a thing.
Ogami... 
Power of Purification… The Pandemonium Regalia… You can forget about all that for a while. 
Right... 
I can't wait to see the Hanayashiki Branch. I wonder who's meeting us there. 
Me too... 
I heard the branch is beneath an amusement park. It’d be nice to visit once things settled down.
...Y-Yes. 
Ogami... Thank you. 
... 
... 
Ogami... Can we stay like this for a while? 
Yeah, sure. 
Sitting here like this… It really calms me down…
Sakura, instead of dwelling on everything that’s happened, let's just try to move forward.
...Yes. 
All right, looks like we’re about to arrive at Hanayashiki.
Hm, so this is the branch's underground facility. Looks different when you aren't inside a Koubu.
But still, who would be waiting for us in a place like this?
Ogami, Sakura, long time no see! 
Tsu-Tsubaki! What on earth are you doing here?!
Ehe! About that... 
Tsubaki Takamura of the Wind Division, reporting with new Spirit Armors from the Hokkaido Branch!
New... Spirit Armors?! 
Affirmative! This was the special mission I left the theater for. 
Now, I'll guide you to the hangar. This way, please. 
Th-These are... 
Are these... our new Spirit Armors?! 
This is the third generation of Spirit Armor designed to succeed the Koubu and Jinbu.
They're classified as... the "Tenbu"!! 
Ogami! With these Tenbu... 
Yes, we can take back the theater! 
Hold your horses, Ogami!
Huh?! That voice... Kayama?! Where is he? 
Ogami! It's coming from that Cinematron over there! 
Heya, Ogami. Being able to call people like this is lovely, isn’t it?
It fills my heart with joy that we can still talk face to face, even though we're far apart.
Kayama, I'm sorry, but I don’t have time to chat right now.
Now, now. Patience, Ogami. In times like this, "Slow and steady wins the race." 
Listen. Right now, I'm hiding inside the Imperial Theater. 
W-What did you say?! 
If you intend to take this place back from the hands of the enemy, I’m here to assist.
Kayama, wait a minute. Why are you there? Just who are you? 
Ogami… <br> It seems the time has finally come for me to reveal the truth…
As the Flower Division fights on the front lines, the Moon Division supports them from the shadows.
They are the troupe’s recon unit… And their captain is none other than myself, Yuichi Kayama. 
What?! You're captain of the Moon Division?! 
Yes. We don’t fight on the battlefield like the Flower Division…
But the Moon Division has their own ways of waging war. We don't have much time, so listen up. 
The enemy has control of the theater's defense curtain, and has closed off the entire building. 
Furthermore, they've fortified their defenses by placing artillery around their perimeter.
Really? Things are getting out of hand, aren't they?
This is where I come in. Time is limited, but we can throw a monkey wrench into one of their defenses.
We can either disable the artillery or the defense curtain. So, what’s it gonna be, Ogami?
Remove the curtain. 
Disable the artillery. 
Remove the curtain. I want to lower the enemy’s defensive capabilities.
The curtain it is. Understood, leave it to me! 
Disable the artillery. I want to at least take away some of their firepower. 
The artillery it is. Understood, leave it to me! 
The rest of the Flower Division is holed up in the underground command room. 
Both Yoneda and Fujieda have also taken up command there. It’s their last line of defense. 
You need to meet up with them as soon as possible. Good luck, Ogami. 
Moon Division... Wind Division... 
Everyone's giving us their support! 
Now it's time for the Flower Division to join in, isn't it? 
Right. We're moving out! With the Tenbu, we're going to rescue our friends and take back the theater! 
Yes! 
Right then, please proceed to the Soaring Whale! You can count on the Wind Division to get you there!
Let's move out! We'll descend on Ginza and storm our besieged theater! 
Sorry, Ogami. I can only sell you one photo per month. 
I see. That's too bad. 
So sorry, Mr. Ogami, but each customer is only allowed to purchase one photo at a time.
Oh, really? That's too bad.
