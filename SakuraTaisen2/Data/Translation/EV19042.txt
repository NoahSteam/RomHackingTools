Why did you choose me to be your partner, Ensign?
Well…
You're precious to me.
I'd be lonely without you.
You're precious to me, Sumire. There's no way I'd leave you alone.
Ohoho! My, of course. A knight must be faithful to his queen.
Well then, we'll be marching on, Ensign!
Yeah. Let's go, Sumire!
I'd be lonely without you. You're the one that I can rely on, so I want you to be with me.
My, really? But, well…
Hearing you say that doesn't irritate me.
I'll assist you as your request. We'll be going, Ensign!
Yeah. Let's go, Sumire!
It's fine even if you say nothing, Ensign.
I can see that you won't be able to devise any plan without me.
Hahaha… <br> That’s the Sumire I know.
