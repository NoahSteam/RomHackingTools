Captain! Why didn't you choose me to come with you?
Well, you see…
You're too important to me…
I want you to lead them.
You're too important to me, Maria.
I couldn't bear to let anything bad happen to you.
Captain…
I appreciate that you're worried for me.
But there's absolutely no reason for you to be concerned. You know that, don't you?
I-I do. But still…
Heh, it's all right. The sentiment is more than enough.
Well then, you just leave this to us, and do your part as best you can.
…OK. Thank you, Maria.
I know that if I leave the second squad in your command, I'll have nothing to worry about.
Captain…
Very well, then. And thank you… for believing in me.
You just leave this to us, and do your part as best you can.
…OK. Thank you, Maria.
Um, no reason in particular, I guess…
Is that so? And here I was certain you had some deeper motive…
Sorry, it seems like I've really let you down.
No, it's all right. It's for the best if we focus on the battle for now.
You just leave this to us, and do your part as best you can.
…OK. Thank you, Maria.
