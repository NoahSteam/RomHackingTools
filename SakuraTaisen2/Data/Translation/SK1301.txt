A month has passed since then... 
It was a bright spring day like any other. 
1 
Strange for Mr. Yoneda to summon me out of the blue like this... 
What could he want with me? 
Ah, Ogami? 
Sakura? What are you doing here? 
Mr. Yoneda told me to come here right away. 
Huh?! Actually, I also got called down here... 
What?! You too, Ogami? 
Hmmm... What's this all about? 
Anyway, let's just hear what the manager has to say. 
Oh my, is that you, Ensign? 
Sumire? What are you doing here? 
I received an urgent summons from Mr. Yoneda. 
Huh, you too? I was also called down here by the manager. 
Well now... What could this be about? 
Hmm… Let's hear what the manager has to say. 
...Captain? 
Is that you, Maria? What are you doing here? 
Yes, Mr. Yoneda summoned me to his office. 
Huh, you too? I was also called down here by the manager. 
What?! You as well, sir? 
Hmm, why'd he ask both of us to come here at the same time? 
Anyway, let's just hear what the manager has to say. 
Huh? Well if it ain't the boss. 
Yo, Boss. What are you doing here? 
I actually just got called down to meet with Mr. Yoneda. 
Huh, you too? I was also asked to come to the manager's office. 
So he summoned you as well, huh? 
What's the big idea, callin’ for the both of us at the same time? 
Anyway, let's just hear what the manager has to say. 
Ah, Mon Frère! 
What are you doing here? 
I was actually called down here by Mr. Yoneda... 
Huh, you too, Mon Frère?! Uncle Yoneda also asked me to meet him here. 
Huh, really? Hmmm... <br> What's this all about? 
Hey, what do you think he wants to talk about? Heheh, now I'm curious! 
Hahaha... <br> Let's go inside for now. 
Oh? Well if it ain't the chief. 
Whatcha doing here, anyway? 
Did you get in trouble and now the manager's making you stand outside his office? 
O-Of course not! I'm not in grade school! 
I was summoned by Mr. Yoneda. Don't know what for, though. 
Say what?! Yoneda called me here too. 
Huh... Wonder why he called for both of us at the same time. 
Kinda intriguing, huh? Anyway, we should hear what he has to say. 
You're right. OK, let's head inside. 
Ah, Mr. Ensiiign! 
Hey, Orihime. What are you doing here? 
Yoneda called me here. I don't know what for, though. 
Huh?! I actually got called down here as well... 
What?! You too, Mr. Ensign? 
If he called for the both of us, then... What could this be about? 
Maybe... He wants us to get married or something? 
I-I don't think that's it... 
Anyway, let's go inside. 
...Captain? 
Hey, Reni. What are you doing here? 
I was summoned by Mr. Yoneda. 
Huh? So was I, actually... 
...You too, sir? 
Calling us both at the same time… What could the manager want? 
Anyway, let's go inside and hear what he has to say. 
Mr. Yoneda, it's Ogami. 
Oh, you're here? Come on in. 
Right. Pardon me. 
Oh, so you two decided to show up together. 
Yes, we ran into each other outside your office. 
Indeed, we happened to meet just outside your office. 
Yes, we just so happened to meet outside your office. 
Yeah, we ran into each other outside your office. 
Uh-huh! We ran into each other right in front of your door! 
Yep, that's right. Just so happened to bump into each other outside your office. 
That's right. We ran into each other before coming inside. 
We just happened to meet a moment ago. 
I see... 
Actually, there's two things I wanted to tell the both of you. 
Huh, what could that be? 
Ogami. As of today, you've been promoted to the rank of Navy Lieutenant, Junior Grade. 
Huh?! Me? <br> Lieutenant Junior Grade?! 
Ogami, your combat record this past year has been truly exceptional. 
The Navy is extremely impressed with how you led the troupe to victory while minimizing casualties. 
Heheh, so, whaddaya think? 
I'll give it my all!
This doesn't feel real…
Yessir! <br> I'll give it my all! Until my very last breath! 
Whoa, whoa, still as uptight as ever, huh? 
Well, I guess that's just how you are. 
Y-Yes, sir. 
To be perfectly honest, sir, this still doesn't feel real. 
Well, this is kind of sudden, can't say I blame you. 
But as your commanding officer, I can vouch for your past achievements and future potential. 
At any rate, you just gotta have faith in yourself. Keep it up, Ogami. 
Y-Yes, sir. 
...Your answer, Ogami? 
Ah... S-Sorry, this is all so sudden, my mind kind of went blank... 
Wahahaha! <br> Totally dumbfounded by that news, eh? 
But I guess that's pretty typical for you. 
Just keep it up, in your own way. Don't overexert yourself. 
Y-Yes, sir. 
Congratulations, Ogami. 
I'm so happy that all your hard work has finally paid off. 
Sakura... Thank you. 
Congratulations, Ensign. 
I'm glad your hard work has finally been recognized. 
Hold on there, Sumire. Ogami's not an ensign anymore, he's a lieutenant now. 
O-Oh yes, my mistake... <br> Force of habit... 
...Lieutenant. Once again, congratulations. 
Sumire... Thanks. 
Congratulations, Captain. 
Maria... Thank you. 
Thinking about all you've done, this was long overdue. 
I hope you remain just as excellent of a captain. 
Awright! That's awesome, Boss! 
So you're a big fancy navy lieutenant now, huh? Wayda go! 
Kanna... Thank you. 
Loo-ten-int... <br> Is that better than ensign? 
Yeah, it's one rank higher. Ogami's moving on up. 
I get it! Mon Frère's becoming important now, huh! 
Congratulations, Mon Frère! I'm happy for you too! 
Iris... Thank you. 
Not bad, Chief! Way to go, getting promoted to lieutenant! 
Well, this was way overdue anyway. For real, congrats! 
Kohran... Thanks. 
That's amazing, Mr. Ensign! I guess I have to start calling you "Mr. Lieutenant" now, huh? 
Lieutenant... Congratulations! 
Thanks, Orihime. Hahaha... You're making me blush. 
That's great, Captain. 
I'm glad your hard work is being recognized, sir. 
Reni... Thanks. 
... 
By the way, sir, what was the other thing you wanted to tell us? 
...Right. The truth is, the powers that be have decided to invest in your future. 
Listen up, Ogami. <br> You've been selected for the personnel exchange program. 
You are to be sent to Europe to study... To Paris, France. 
Huh?! 
Then that means... <br> Ogami is... 
Th-That means... <br> It can't be... 
Th-Then that means... 
Wh-What?! Hold on, you don't mean... 
Huh?! Then... <br> Then Mon Frère... 
S-Say what?! Then that means the chief's... 
P-Paris?! <br> Then that means... No... 
So... In other words... 
...That's right. He'll be leaving the theater. 
I don't know when he'll be back... I'm afraid you two will be apart for a long time. 
No... 
No... 
... 
Wha... <br> What the hell... 
No... <br> No, I won't let him! 
Chief... 
No... That can't be... 
Captain... 
... 
Ogami. <br> Go see the world. Broaden your horizons and grow. 
What'll we do, Sakura? 
Sakura... What do we do? 
I understand that you don't want to leave Sakura or the Flower Division. 
I don't want to leave the theater, the Flower Division, or Sakura! 
What'll we do, Sumire? 
Sumire... What do we do? 
I understand that you don't want to leave Sumire or the Flower Division. 
I don't want to leave the theater, the Flower Division, or Sumire! 
What'll we do, Maria? 
Maria... What do we do? 
I understand that you don't want to leave Maria or the Flower Division. 
I don't want to leave the theater, the Flower Division, or Maria! 
What'll we do, Kanna? 
Kanna... What do we do? 
I understand that you don't want to leave Kanna or the Flower Division. 
I don't want to leave the theater, the Flower Division, or Kanna! 
What'll we do, Iris? 
Iris... What do we do? 
I understand that you don't want to leave Iris or the Flower Division. 
I don't want to leave the theater, the Flower Division, or Iris! 
What'll we do, Kohran? 
Kohran... What do we do? 
I understand that you don't want to leave Kohran or the Flower Division. 
I don't want to leave the theater, the Flower Division, or Kohran! 
What'll we do, Orihime? 
Orihime... What do we do? 
I understand that you don't want to leave Orihime or the Flower Division. 
I don't want to leave the theater, the Flower Division, or Orihime! 
What'll we do, Reni? 
Reni... What do we do? 
I understand that you don't want to leave Reni or the Flower Division. 
I don't want to leave the theater, the Flower Division, or Reni! 
...I understand. 
...I don't want to go. 
...I understand. 
It'll be hard to leave everyone in the Flower Division behind... But I'll go. 
Ogami... 
... 
Captain... 
Boss... 
Mon Frère... 
... 
... 
... 
...I see. Well said, Ogami. 
I know you'll exceed everyone's expectations. 
I... don't want to go. 
Ogami, you dumbass! <br> Don't be a spoiled brat! 
Are the theater and the Flower Division all you care about? Are they all you have to protect?! 
Have you forgotten your duty to protect the lives and happiness of the people?! 
Mr. Yoneda... 
Our fight never truly ends. We have to keep protecting this peace. 
So please, Ogami, try to understand. We're counting on you. 
... 
I-I... 
... 
... 
I-I... 
NO! <br> I wanna be with Mon Frère! 
I-I... 
I-I... 
... 
Ogami... 
Listen, I want you to remember something, Ogami. 
It's not just this theater or the Flower Division we're protecting. 
Protecting the lives and happiness of the people... That's the sworn duty of the Assault Troupe. 
Mr. Yoneda... 
Our fight never truly ends. We have to keep protecting this peace. 
So please, Ogami, try to understand. 
... 
... 
I know this is all rather sudden. I don't blame you for being at a loss right now. 
However, I want you to remember something, Ogami. 
It's not just this theater or the Flower Division we're protecting. 
Protecting the lives and happiness of the people... That's the sworn duty of the Assault Troupe. 
Mr. Yoneda... 
Our fight never truly ends. We have to keep protecting this peace. 
So please, Ogami, try to understand. 
... 
Your departure date is one week from now. You'll be setting off from Yokohama harbor. 
Make all the necessary preparations for your trip, Ogami. 
Sakura... 
So... It looks like we have to be apart again... 
... 
But... I know that going to France... 
I know it'll be good for you, Ogami. 
So please, Ogami... <br> Go to France. 
I'll be... all right. 
...Sakura? 
I'm sorry! I know I... <br> I know I shouldn't cry! 
I know I shouldn't cry as you're about to leave, but...! 
Sakura... 
... 
So... We must part once again, Ensign. 
Oh... My apologies. It's not Ensign anymore, is it? It's Lieutenant. 
I'll have to get used to calling you that... and get used to your absence. 
Sumire... 
Lieutenant. Go... <br> Go to France. 
I came to this theater because I believed in my own path in life. 
By the same token, I have no intention of holding you back. 
... 
...I'll be all right. 
My parents... My grandfather... And you most of all. You all taught me something. 
No matter how far apart we may be... We can still be together in our hearts. 
Sumire... 
Congratulations, Captain. 
It's wonderful that you get to study in France. 
But... That means we have to be apart. 
... 
I'd be lying if I said I wasn't also sad. 
But this is a great opportunity for you. 
It was the same for me. Getting to visit a foreign country can be a great experience. 
... 
...I'll be fine.
After all, this doesn't mean we'll never see each other again. 
Besides, whenever I feel lonely... I'll always have my locket. 
Maria... 
... 
This is all so sudden, I have no idea what to say... 
Kanna... 
Well, now that I think about it, I did ditch ya to go train in Okinawa... 
So I guess now it's your turn to go train in France. 
... 
Well if you're gonna go, then give it everythin’ you got while you're there! 
You don't have to worry ‘bout the theater while I'm here. 
I can't wait to see you lookin' big and strong after all that trainin’, Boss! 
Kanna... 
*sob*... <br> Eh... Eh... 
Iris... 
I wanna stay with you, Mon Frère... 
I don't want you to leave... 
... 
You promised me when you came back, remember?! 
You said you'd never leave me again... You said we'd always be together... 
I'm staying with you forever, no matter what! 
I don't care if you're going to France or whatever! 
Iris... 
Congrats, Chief. 
You get to go study in France... Way to go. 
... 
I always knew this day would come. 
A guy like you was bound to spread his wings and see the world. 
Kohran... 
... 
... 
Nope... <br> I just... can't do it... 
I wanna be all happy and cheerful about this, but... 
No matter how hard I try... The tears won't stop welling up. 
My head understands... But my heart isn't having any of it. 
Kohran... 
... 
Orihime... 
I thought we'd get to make all kinds of fun memories together from here on out... 
But now we... have to be apart... 
... 
But even when Papa and Mamma were far apart... 
They never stopped thinking about each other. 
And I'll always be thinking about you, Mr. Ensign. 
Orihime... 
I wish I could've met you sooner... 
And I wish I could've stayed with you longer. 
... 
Reni... 
I wanted to go to all kinds of places with you... 
I wanted you to teach me all kinds of things…
... 
But Europe is more advanced than Japan in a lot of ways... 
So I know you'll see great results from your studies there. 
I see... 
... 
There is... something new I've just learned. 
I learned... how hard it can be... to say goodbye. 
Reni... 
The following week was spent preparing for the trip. 
The time passed in an instant. 
And then... <br> The day before departure... 
…As you're all aware, Ogami's finally leaving for Paris tomorrow. 
Ogami… If you could say something to everyone. 
... 
Express your resolve. 
Address everyone. 
It's hard saying goodbye to everyone… But I've decided to go to France. 
I will use this opportunity to see a whole new world and test myself. 
I don't know what France has in store for me... 
But as a member of the Imperial Assault Troupe, just like all of you, I will do my absolute best. 
Sakura... Sumire... Maria... Kanna... 
Iris... Kohran... Orihime... and Reni... 
I truly enjoyed this past year I spent with all of you. 
I may be leaving for France tomorrow... 
But I'll never forget the memories I made with you for as long as I live. 
... 
Thank you so much, everyone. 
There's nothing I need to say to all of you... 
I believe in you, that even while I'm in France, you'll be more than able to protect the capital. 
And I know the day will come when I'll get to see you all again. 
Until then... We'll have to be apart for a while. 
But I'll never forget the memories I made with you for as long as I live. 
... 
Thank you so much, everyone. 
... 
…Now it's all your turn to say something to Ogami. 
Captain, you don't have to worry about the Flower Division. 
We'll keep working hard, with your words in our hearts. 
Take care of yourself, all right, Chief? 
You'll have to tell me all about how it is over there sometime. 
No matter how far apart we may be... 
Our hearts will always be as one. 
Uhh... <br> Sniff... Mon Frère... 
Come, now, Iris, don't cry. 
Mon Frère... <br> Don't forget about me... OK? 
I'll always... Always…  
Sniff.. Uhh... 
…It's OK, Iris. There's no way the boss would forget about us. 
Heheh, you better not half-ass your trainin’ while you're in France, Boss. 
I want you to come back even stronger and more reliable than you are now. 
And while you're there... 
Do your best to become a proper Parisian gentleman. 
You taught me so much, Captain. 
I'll never forget any of it for as long as I live. 
I'm sure the day will come when we'll be able to see each other again. 
We'll keep working hard until that day comes. 
Ogami… Have a safe trip. 
Everyone... Thank you. 
All right! Now that we've congratulated Ogami on his promotion and transfer to France... 
It's time for Ogami's going-away party! Now let's party hard! 
Awright! Let's have fun, people! For the boss! 
The going-away party was so much fun. Even Kasumi and the others joined in. 
I'm finally setting off tomorrow. 
Tonight's the last night I'll be spending at the Imperial Theater... 
Hm? Who could that be, at this hour? 
Could it be... 
Ogami... 
Sakura... 
Sorry to disturb you so late... 
I, um... Wanted to give you this. 
What's this? 
It's a letter for you... From me. 
Please read it once you're on the boat. 
Sakura... Thank you. 
Well then... <br> Good night, Ogami. 
Sakura... 
Sumire... 
My apologies for disturbing you this late at night. 
You see, I came here to give you this. 
What's this? 
It's a letter written by me. 
Please read it once you're on the boat for France. 
Sumire... Thank you. 
Right, then... <br> I'll be taking my leave. 
Ensign-- <br> Erm, Lieutenant... <br> Good night. 
Sumire... 
Apologies for disturbing you so late, Captain. 
Maria... 
I... tried writing you a letter. I'd like you to have it. 
Maria... 
Please read it once you're on the boat to France. 
Maria... Thank you. 
Well then, Captain... <br> I'll be going. Good night. 
Maria... 
Hey, Boss, sorry for buggin' ya this late. 
Kanna... Has something happened? 
Um, well... This isn't really my kinda thing, but... 
I, uh... wrote you a letter. Would you mind readin’ it? 
Kanna... 
Heheh, it's kind of embarrassing, though, so wait till you're on the boat first, OK? 
Kanna... Thank you. 
Heheh, no, thank YOU for acceptin’ it. 
Well, see ya, Boss. G'night. 
Kanna... 
Mon Frère... 
Iris... 
I... wrote you a letter, Mon Frère. 
Iris... 
Don't read it until you're on the boat... OK? 
Iris... Thank you. 
Mon Frère... 
... 
Don't worry about me. I'll try not to feel too lonely. 
Well... <br> Good night, Mon Frère. 
Iris... 
Sorry for bugging you so late at night, Chief. 
Kohran... 
You see, I, uh... I have something for you. 
If it's all right, I'd like you to take this. 
What's this? 
It's a letter I wrote... For you. 
Um... It's kind of embarrassing, so wait till you're on the boat to read it, 'kay? 
Kohran... Thanks. 
All right then, night, Chief. 
Kohran... 
Oh thank goodness, you're still up, Mr. Lieutenant. 
Orihime... 
Um... I actually have something for you. 
Something for me? 
What's this? 
I wrote a letter for you… Mr. Lieutenant.
Read it once you're on the boat to France. 
Orihime... Thank you. 
All right, then, Mr. Lieutenant... Good night. 
Orihime... 
Reni... 
I... wrote you a letter. 
Huh? A letter? For me? 
Yeah. Here it is... 
Reni... 
I've never written a letter to anybody before... 
But if you could read it once you're on the boat... That would make me happy. 
Thank you, Reni. I'll make sure to read it. 
OK... 
Well then, Captain... <br> Good night. 
Reni... 
OK... That's all my bags, packed and ready. 
Time to say goodbye to this room, I guess... 
... 
Right... Time to go. 
Ogamiii! Hold on a second! 
...Kayama?! 
Ogami, are you really leaving this early? 
Heading out alone so that you won't make the others feel sad, I take it? 
... 
No proverb today, Kayama? 
No. A man doesn't need words when he's about to embark on a journey. 
Till we meet again… Ogami. 
...Yeah. See you, Kayama. 
I guess this means goodbye for now... Grand Imperial Theater. 
... 
Goodbye... <br> Everyone. 
I'm writing to you today as the cherry blossoms in the capital are in full bloom. It truly is peaceful. 
Congratulations again on your promotion to Lieutenant Junior Grade, Ogami. 
As I write this letter, I can't help but remember when we first met in Ueno during the spring. 
It's hard to say goodbye, but I'll always carry in my heart the joy I felt at that moment. 
I wish I could join you on your trip to Paris... 
But I don't think you'd be very happy if I did. 
You always keep moving forward, so I'll follow your example and keep working hard in the troupe. 
I'll keep improving myself so that I can be the Sakura you deserve. 
I'll always cherish the memories I shared with you and the things I learned from you. 
I'll write you plenty of letters, and I'll keep your room clean. 
Have a safe trip. I eagerly await your return. 
Sincerely, <br> Imperial Assault Troupe, Flower Division <br> Sakura Shinguji 
Dear Lieutenant, <br> Congratulations on your promotion. 
I have found myself unable to sleep at night ever since I heard you were leaving for Paris. 
However, I realize I'm the top star of the Flower Division. 
I'm sure you'd laugh at me if I just kept moping around forever. 
That's why I've decided-- and don't act surprised-- 
That through my acting, I'm going to secure the Flower Division a performance in Europe. 
Then all of Europe will see what I am truly capable of. 
Ahh, I can hear their cheers already... 
Then you'll finally get to reunite with Europe's top star in Paris, the city of flowers. 
Doesn't that sound romantic? But until then... 
We will have to be apart for a while. Stay safe, and take care of yourself. 
Best, <br> Imperial Assault Troupe, Flower Division <br> Sumire Kanzaki 
My dear Captain Ogami, <br> Congratulations on your promotion to Lieutenant Junior Grade. 
You're leaving for Paris tomorrow on a special assignment. I'm going to miss you. 
But don't worry. I'm not going to complain. 
No matter how far apart we may be, our hearts are connected. 
I know one can only taste the joys of spring after braving the harsh winter. 
You can leave the Flower Division to me. I will not falter anymore. 
The Flower Division is my motherland now. 
The future of Japan rests on your shoulders, Captain. Study hard and come back to us. 
The water in Europe isn't very clean, so do be careful. 
I'll be praying for your safety and success, from the bottom of my heart. 
P.S. I've started learning how to swim. Perhaps we can swim together someday. 
Yours truly from Tokyo, <br> Imperial Assault Troupe, Flower Division <br> Maria Tachibana 
Yo! Congrats on the promotion to lieutenant. I'm just as happy for you as I'd be for myself. 
I was shocked to hear you were leaving for Paris so soon. I'm gonna miss ya. 
The theater without you is like a hinomaru bento without the plum. 
But it's thanks to you that we all learned to trust in each other... 
So even while you're gone, we'll stick together and protect the capital. 
You don't have to worry about a thing, Boss. Just study up in Paris and come back to us. 
That way you can teach us even more stuff. 
In Okinawa, we've got the legend of Nirai Kanai. It's about a paradise off in the west. 
I hope Paris winds up being your Nirai Kanai. 
No matter when, no matter where, you'll always be our captain. 
I'm rooting for you, from the bottom of my heart. Never give up! I'll always be in your corner! 
See ya later. <br> Imperial Assault Troupe, Flower Division <br> Kanna Kirishima 
I'm in my room right now, writing you this letter. 
I'm really gonna miss you while you're away in Paris, Mon Frère. 
I'm totally against it! You shouldn't have to go to Paris at all! 
I've cried about it so much... But I'm a grown-up. 
I'm not gonna cry in front of you. I promised Jean-Paul I wouldn't. 
Uncle Yoneda told me this is for your growth. 
I don't get it, though. You can grow no matter where you are, can't you? 
You'd be better off staying here with me, don't you agree? 
I know that's just me being selfish, though. 
Being a grown-up means not acting sad even when you really are. 
I'll be brave about it, so write me back, OK? I'll be waiting. 
I love you, Mon Frère. <br> Imperial Assault Troupe, Flower Division <br> Iris 
Dear Chief, <br> So, you're a lieutenant now! For real, congrats. 
I'm really gonna miss you while you're off in Paris, though. 
Hey, what kind of place do you think Paris is? Think they got some neat inventions there? 
Paris, the city of flowers! Paris, capital of the world! Ahh, I wanna go so bad. 
If we ever get the chance, I wanna go exploring the city with you, Chief. 
Oh yeah, I've got a new dream! I'm building an airplane! 
A plane capable of continuous flight around the world. If I ever finish it, I'm coming for ya! 
Then I'll snatch you up, and we'll travel around the world together! 
Ah, jeez. <br> There I go, talking nonsense again. 
But y'know, none of your dreams will come true if you don't work hard for them. 
I'm gonna do my best. You do your best too, Chief. Take care of yourself. 
See you again someday. <br> Imperial Assault Troupe, Flower Division <br> Kohran Li 
Ciao, Mr. Ensign. <br> Wait, no, you've been promoted to Lieutenant now, huh? 
Congratulations, and grazie! You're probably reading this on the boat, huh? 
How's the boat ride been so far? Feeling lonely? Want me to come join you? 
Just kidding. <br> I'm busy right now with requests from all over the world to come perform. 
Even though we're so far apart, we're together in our hearts. 
Let's keep working hard, never letting go of our desire to meet with one another. 
Papa and Mamma never stopped loving each other, no matter how far apart they were. 
I know our love, too, can overcome any distance. 
We might even be able to see each other once a year, just like in the Tanabata legend... 
Nevertheless, I can say with confidence that you're one of a kind, Mr. Lieutenant.

With love, <br> Imperial Assault Troupe, Flower Division <br> Orihime Soletta 
May 1925. <br> I was transferred to the Imperial Assault Troupe. I met you for the first time. 
August 1925. <br> Together with the Flower Division, I went to a hot spring for the first time. 
So much happened then. I still get a little embarrassed just thinking about it. 
September 1925. <br> You saved me from Suiko's control. 
From the moment I met you, something inside me slowly began to change. 
December 1925. <br> The Christmas play. <br> You picked me to play the lead. 
I celebrated my birthday for the first time ever. I visited a chapel with you. I'll never forget that day. 
January 1926. <br> We spent New Year's alone together, and took part in that final battle. 
A lot has happened in the year I've spent with you. You've changed me, Captain. 
You're a big part of my life now. Perhaps you always will be. 
Congratulations once again on your promotion. I await the day we can meet again.

Sorry, Ogami. I can only sell you one bromide per month. 
I see. That's too bad. 
So sorry, Mr. Ogami, but each customer is only allowed to purchase one bromide at a time.  
Oh, really? That's too bad.
