Nrgh… Assault Troupe… <br> How could mere humans… <br> Rrgh… Damn you all…
Hmph, figures that's all you could muster.
So long as we're here in the capital, we're not gonna let ya get away with your schemes!
Just you wait! Next time… <br> Next time I'll end you!
Phew, that takes care of that.
Yeah… I guess so.
All's well that ends well, right, Sumire? The marriage got called off and you get to return to the troupe.
That's true. <br> I suppose I ought to thank you.
You did let your last chance slip away, though.
Whatever do you mean?
To get married! There's no one else left on earth who'd want to marry a snake like you, is there?
You… You're one to talk, considering a brute like yourself will never even have a chance at marriage! 
What didja say?!
Oh, care to refute that?
Hahaha! It's been so long since I've seen Sumire and Kanna fight like this.
Those two, are they comedians or something? They're hilarious.
Huh? N-No, not exactly.
All right, you two. Can you at least play nice long enough for us to wrap things up?
I can't promise we'll "play nice," but… you're referring to our ending tradition, yes?
Oh yeah, our usual thing! <br> All right, let's go! <br> All together…
Victory pose, yeah!!
Victory pose, yeah!!
