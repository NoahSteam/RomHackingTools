I destroyed the second one, Ogami! Just one more left.
Ohoho, we've destroyed two already! Just one more to go.
That makes two! <br> Only one left!
That's number two down. <br> Heh, what a joke! <br> Just one more to go!
Two! <br> Just one more!
Nice! <br> That's two down, just one more to go!
All done over here! <br> Just one more left.
Cannon two has ceased to function. One cannon remaining.
