Damn it! The enemies reached Sumire's house!
Hahaha! <br> I was hoping you'd put up a bit more of a fight…
G-Grandfather!!
Urgh… Is everyone inside all right?!
…You can all relax. It appears that everybody inside the mansion managed to evacuate.
Kaede!
But putting that aside, we still have the enemy leader to worry about! Don't let your guard down!
Sumire… <br> Thank goodness they all made it out safely, huh?
I don't know who or what this Black Demon Society is… But they're not getting away with this!
Here I go, Ensign!
Right! Let's go, everyone!
