Reni is so awesome, Mon Frère!
The Star Division has lots of amazing people.
I agree.
But I think you’re just as amazing, Mon Frère!
That’s the fifth one! You beat the bad guys!
Give a cool response
Brag a little
Ah, it's no big deal.
Wow, Mon Frère! You're kind of classy! I like that!
Ah, it's no big deal.
What's wrong, Mon Frère? That response wasn’t very serious like you usually are…
(Do I always come off as such a humorless person?)
Well, I AM pretty awesome. Right, Iris?
What's wrong? You wanna beat Reni that badly?
It's not like you to boast that way, Mon Frère.
(It… It's not? Am I too focused on outdoing Reni?)
Well, I AM pretty awesome. Right, Iris?
Tee-hee! You're just your usual cheerful self, Mon Frère!
I'm gonna work hard too! I won't lose to Reni!
Yaaay!!
Right, Iris. Let's do our best too to keep up with Reni.
Yeah!
