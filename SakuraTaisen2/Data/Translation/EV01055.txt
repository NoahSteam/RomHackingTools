Reni is so awesome, Mon Frère!
The Star Division has lots of great people.
You're right.
But I think you're just as awesome!
You just finished five of the enemies, right?
Act cool to answer
Brag a little
Well…
You're kind of classy, Mon Frère! I like that!
Well…
What's wrong, Mon Frère? That's not like you… 
(Was I always act diligent?)
Well, I AM awesome. Right, Iris?
What's wrong? Do you want to win from Reni so bad?
It's not like you to brag yourself like that, Mon Frère.
(Is it? Am I being too aware with Reni's action?)
Well, I AM awesome. Right, Iris?
Tee-hee! You're just being cheerful like usual, Mon Frère!
I'm gonna work hard too! I won't lose to Reni!
Yaaay!!
Right, Iris. Let's do our best too to keep up with Reni.
Yeah!
