Orihime, are you all right?!
Oh, you were worried about me, Sakura? Thank you!
Come to think of it, you came to my rescue in the very first battle I was in after joining the troupe…
Orihime…
I understand now all the things you said back then!
If you are ever in trouble, I will be there to help you this time!
Orihime…
Come on, Sakura! Let us go!
