All right… Which number should I dial? 
Oh, no! I didn't realize it was already 4 o'clock! 
Kohran must be waiting in her room! I gotta hurry!! 
Kohran is back at the theater… 
No need to call her, I can just go talk to her in person.
Kanna returned to the theater last month, so I don’t need to call her anymore.
Sumire is already back at the theater.
Still, I was pretty surprised when she called me last month. 
Hello, this is Maria Tachibana speaking.
Hey, Maria. 
Captain... It's been a long time. 
Right now I'm on a ship heading to Japan. 
If the trip goes well, I may arrive at the theater by tomorrow. 
I see. So you’re finally coming back to us.
Yes. I've been looking forward to seeing everyone. 
Well, I'm still on board the ship… So if you’ll excuse me. 
Maria’s on her way back…
Soon the Flower Division will be back at its full strength. 
...Maria's not answering. 
Well, I'll be able to talk to her in person soon. Just need to be patient.
Good afternoon. It's time for Capital News. 
A month has passed since the Society infiltrated the residence of Kanzaki Heavy Industry's chairman. 
Why did the attackers appear at the Kanzaki estate?
And how was the Imperial Assault Troop able to respond so quickly? There are still many mysteries.
The Capital Daily Report will continue to follow the incident and report any new details we find.
Next, we have more news regarding the Kanzaki Group.
We discovered that the day the Black Demon Society attacked the Kanzaki residence...
Marriage talks were taking place between the family's daughter, Miss Sumire, and Viscount Makibishi's son.
Miss Sumire later returned to the Assault Troupe and made her appearance in their summer production.
She and Kanna Kirishime, the lead actress, gave a wonderful performance for the audience. 
In addition, the summer play also saw the arrival of a newcomer to the troupe named Orihime Soletta.
The production marked her theatrical debut in Japan.
Soletta’s mesmerizing acting skills, acquired in her homeland of Europe, have captivated audiences.
Fans are already eagerly awaiting the day she plays a leading role.
Finally, it's time for this week's weather forecast. 
July has arrived, which means it's about time for students to change into their summer uniforms.
And the summer heat is also about to arrive in full force.
Temperatures are expected to reach record highs as a high-pressure system covers the Kanto region.
That's it for Capital News, brought to you by the Capital Daily Report. 
That concludes today's broadcast. We hope you will look forward to tomorrow's programming.

Masked Red infiltrates the old western house as he pursues the mysterious mummy.
The inside of the building is in disrepair as if it hadn’t been used in many years.
On the dusty floor, the mummy's footprints are clearly visible.
Following the footprints, Masked Red descends into the basement. 
In the back of the dark basement, Red spots lights illuminating through a large door.
Inside, he locates the mummy, as well as an elderly man wearing a white rode standing before him.
“Y-You're the genius scientist, Professor Kurogane! Are you the culprit behind all this?" 
"Heh heh heh... Just as I expected from you, Masked Red. However, this is as far as you go.”
Professor Kurogane presses a button, and the floor under Red’s feet suddenly disappears!
