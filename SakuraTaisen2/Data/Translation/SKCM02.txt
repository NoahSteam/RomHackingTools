Oooh, it's so cool! Come on, Mon Frère, quick!
Hahaha… OK, here we go.
Hello, this is the Hanayashiki Branch.
Hi, Kohran. It's been a while.
Ah, it's you, Chief. You called me right away.
Well, you taught me how to use it. So…
Yaaay, it's Kohran! Ehehehe, Iris here!
Aha, even Iris is there! Let's move to the big screen, OK?
Hehe, I can hear you loud and clear. I can see Iris's face on screen, too.
I can see your face too!
The Hanayashiki Branch is close to the theater, so the reception is quite good.
Oh, right, right. I'll tell you something great.
Masked Red's radio show will be on air some time later.
Ooh… It sounds fun!
If you got some time, hit "13510" to listen to it.
OK. Thanks, Kohran.
You can listen to some other broadcasts with Cinematron, too. Try listen to them.
I'm gonna go back to work now. See you later, guys.
Masked Red, huh… It sounds fun!
You're right, maybe I'll try to listen to it when I have some time.
Now… What to do next?
…Ooh, by the way, I heard all about your battle in front of the theater!
The Eisenkleid did really great, huh? Ah… I really wanna see it.
So, which one? Between the Eisenkleid and the Koubu Kai, which one was the strongest?
Let's see…
The Eisenkleid?
The Koubu Kai?
The Eisenkleid, I guess? It helped us quite a lot.
Well, isn't that great? I really wanna put my hands on it quickly.
Hahaha, you really love to tinker with machines, don't you?
The Koubu Kai, I guess? It has balanced functions, so it's quite great.
Heh heh, it's because I adore and treat them special. 
I developed each of them based on your preferences.
Ooh, I didn't know that. No wonder it was easy to ride.
Hehehe. Thanks a lot, Chief.
Hmm… I can't tell which one.
Oh, so you can't tell. But I guess both are quite equal.
The Eisenkleid and the Koubu Kai must have equal abilities.
So… What would be their difference?
It's, "love." What matters most is love from the pilot and mechanic.
Eisenkleid is great, but actually… I'm doing something great too.
Look forward to it, 'kay? It'll be done soon.
OK, I gotta get back to work now. See you two later.
Good luck, Kohran! Bye-bye!
Kohran really likes machines, doesn't she?
Yeah… She looks so bright when we were talking about machines.
…Kohran's not answering.
She said that she's going back to work.
Oh, right. She said that.
Oh, Boss! And… there's Iris too.
Hi, Kanna. I thought that I should give you a call.
Hello…
Oh, Kanna! This is Ogami.
Oh, it's you, Boss!! You remembered my number!
Yaaay! It's Kanna, it's Kanna! So, so, are you fine?
Yeah, of course. Let's move to the big screen, then.
Hehe… Looks like you two are doing OK.
OK… What should we talk about?
Hello… Is this Ensign Ogami?
It's been a while, Ensign. My, is that Iris beside you?
Oh, Sumire, is that you?
What are you doing? Just when I'm the middle of a conversation with Boss.
Oh, Boss, it's you.
Oh, Kanna. So this is your call number.
Yeah, it is. So, what's your business?
Oh, it's you, Boss. What's your business?
Can you wait for a bit? I'm moving this to the big screen.
So, Boss, what's your business?
Uh… So… I thought what I did was wrong…
Huh? So you're calling me just for that?
Uh… Sorry about earlier, Kanna. I went too far.
No biggie, Boss. I won't get angry just for that.
Hahaha, thank goodness. I'm gonna end the call now. See you later, Kanna.
Yeah, call me again later, OK?
…Looks like Kanna has gotten over her bad mood.
That's great, Mon Frère.
Hello, this is Kanna Kirishima.
Oh! Kanna, so this is your number.
Boss, it's you. You remembered my number.
Hm… It's you, Boss. Do you got something?
Can you wait for a bit? I'm moving this to the big screen.
I heard that you went on a mission right after you got back to the theater, Boss.
That's right! Enemies suddenly attacked the theater…
But Mon Frère chased them away in a flash!
Oh, that so? Now that's our Boss.
OK! I won't lose to you, Boss.
I gotta train with more oomph!
Later, Boss! You too, Iris. Be a good kid, OK?
I hope Kanna can get back soon.
You're right. She's the one who can brighten up our mood.
Kanna's not answering…
She must be went for training or eating.
Well, I can't get through to her.
Hello…
Hi, Sumire. It's Ogami.
My, you called my number right away, Ensign!
…Yes, hello?
Ah, Sumire! This is Ogami.
My, you remembered my number, Ensign!
Yaaay, it's Sumire! Long time no see!
My… Isn't that Iris?
Why don't we talk on the big screen, then?
So… You still can't go back here?
That's true! My family won't let me return.
Oh, dear me… What are they planning to do?
Hello. Is that you, Boss?
Oh… That voice, isn't that Kanna?
Yo, Boss. Oh… And Iris, too.
Hey, Kanna! I'm having a conversation with the ensign!
Oh my, Ensign…
Oh, Sumire, so this was your number?
Yes, that's true. By the way, is something the matter, Ensign?
My, Ensign… Is something matter?
Is something matter, Ensign?
Uh… I'm sorry about earlier. I went a bit too far.
Oh! So you're calling me only for that?
Yeah. I apologize for that.
Ensign…
I accept your thoughts, Ensign. Thank you very much.
That's great, Mon Frère. Sumire said thanks.
Right. I'm relieved to hear that.
I'm gonna end the call now. See you later, Sumire.
Yes, I'll excuse myself. Take care.
From now on, don't hurt woman's feeling again, Mon Frère.
Uhm… I-I'll be more careful next time.
…Hello?
Oh! Sumire, so this was your number?
My, Ensign… You remembered my number.
My, Ensign. Are you doing well?
Can you wait for a while? I'm going to move to the big screen.
Listen, Sumire! We're going to have a new member soon!!
Oh, didn't we already have a new member assigned to us last month?
Well, the other one will arrive right after lunch break.
I can't wait for it! I hope we can be friends.
I would love to return as well. I miss relaxing at the salon while enjoying my tea.
Right, you better come back quickly, Sumire! Everyone is waiting for you.
Ohohoho… Thank you very much.
Well then, I'll excuse myself. Take care.
OK… Which number should we reach next?
Sumire's not answering…
Maybe she went into another room?
Well, I can't get through to her.
G-Guys, calm down…
Good grief… Just when we're having a conversation, you came to ruin the mood.
You too! I'm talking with the boss now, don't get in my way!
The ensign wants to talk to ME!
No, it's ME! Right, Boss?
I wanna talk to…
Sumire
Kanna
Iris
I want to talk with Sumire…
Well, look at that. It's just like what I said, isn't it?
…Tch. I get it, sorry for intruding.
Ah… That Kanna, she doesn't need to end the call… 
Ah… She cut the call.
You two are acting like usual.
…A-Anyway! I'm absolutely going to slip out from Kanzaki Residence soon.
For this month's summer performance, please make sure you save one role for me to fill.
Oh boy… I didn't get to talk much, after all.
Will Sumire come home soon?
With that situation, I think it would be still difficult for her.
Now… What to do next?
I want to talk with Kanna…
Well, you hear that? Boss wants to talk with ME!
Huh, goodness! Then I'll withdraw myself from this conversation!
Uh…
Jeez, Sumire. There's no need to cut the call.
Oh boy… You two are acting like usual.
But you look worried, Kanna.
Do… Don't be ridiculous! Why should I…
A-Anyway… I'm gonna go back to the theater next month!
Take care, you two! Later!
Oh boy… I didn't get to talk much, after all.
But Kanna said she'll go back next month. We can't wait for it, right?
Of course. I can talk to her easily whe she gets here.
Now… What to do next?
I want to talk with Iris…
Huh? Really, Mon Frère? Yaaay!
If you want to talk with her, don't you think there's no need to call us?
Oh, jeez! We're not gonna join this foolish thing.
Let's end this call, Kanna.
Yeah, I'm leaving. Later, Boss!
Ah, those two…
I'll listen to your stories!
Oh, thanks, Iris.
Now, what should I do now…
Uhm… About that…
Asking the indecisive person like the ensign is such a mistake.
Yeah, you're right. No matter how long we'll wait, he won't answer.
I'm sort of losing my will to fight. I'm leaving first.
It's quite dissapointing that Kanna left.
I'll excuse myself. Take care, both of you.
That was great, Mon Frère! You stopped Kanna and Sumire's fight!
Uh… Well, let's just say that.
OK… What should I do next?
Hello, this is Maria Tachibana.
Hi, Maria. I thought that I should give you a call.
Yes. Who am I speaking to?
Oh! Maria, so this was your number?
Yahooo! Iris here!
Captain, Iris… Seems that you're both doing well.
Let's talk on the big screen.
Wow, we can talk with Maria in America! Awesome!!
Yes, thanks to Kohran's invention, this Cinematron.
I can see Iris is being active.
She's been doing great.
She's been a trouble.
She's been doing great.
She's been a trouble.
I'm doing great too.
Yeah, she's been doing great. Especially today.
Ehehe! It's because I'm with Mon Frère!
Having him came home has reaaally cheered me up!
Is that so? That's great.
Looks like you managed to bring all the members together, Captain.
Hahaha… Well, sort of.
Uh… I'm doing great too.
Oh, I'm sorry, Captain. I kept talking only with Iris.
Seeing that you're doing well is more than enough for me, Captain.
Mon Frère is doing OK because I'm with him!
Yeah, she's been too active that it troubles me.
Mon Frère, you meanie! Are you saying that I shouldn't be active?!
She's right, Captain. That was too far of you.
Ah… S-Sorry, I was joking for a bit.
Even if you say so, this isn't an acceptable situation. 
You need to watch what are you going to express.
I-I'm sorry. I'll keep that in mind.
…
Ah… I'm sorry, Captain. I kept talking only with Iris.
No, not at all. You two are having fun, so it's fine.
You're really kind, Mon Frère!
Iris, I won't be able to return to Japan until this summer, so… 
Make sure you listen what the captain says.
OK!
Well now, I'm going to end the call, Captain. Good luck at there.
It's great we could talk with Maria, isn't it, Mon Frère?
Yeah, you're right.
…Maria's not answering.
I wonder if she went to another room.
Good afternoon. This is Capital News.
First, we're bringing you follow-up news of bombing incident that stirs Ginza last month.

Despite buildings and trams were destroyed during the incident.
The cause remains unknown, but it's now widely believed to have been a steam pipe accident.
Next, we have news on the Imperial Assault Troupe appeared for the first time since last year.
The Imperial Assault Troupe is believed to have been on hiatus after their recent battle in Tokyo Bay last year…
But last month, they appeared once again in Ginza, to assist the recovery process after the bombing incident.
According to eyewitnesses, they were riding upgraded Spirit Armors.
They also had a different model of spirit armor.
We're about to share one fun topic, news regarding clever dogs.
Ben the Genius Dog will be performing in America soon.

Serial Radio Drama Masked Red, The Terrifying Mummy, Part 1
One summer night, a girl walked past the dim and quiet street.
"Oh, no. I've been practicing koto until late."
As she was about to enter the narrow alley, someone stood up in front of her.
What makes her startled herself is a two-meters giant.
And for some reason, its entire body is wrapped in layers of light-brown bandages.
The monster's eyes seemed to glow red, and its huge hands are about to reach the girl.
"Aaaahhh!!! Somebody, help!" <br> After that…!
"That's enough!" and a red steam bike appeared.
"Oh, Masked Red!" <br> "You're safe now, Miss. I've arrived."
Masked Red flips his cape and dashes down from the steam bike!

It'll be 12 o'clock soon, so we better get going, Iris.
Whaaat?! Mon Frère, use this!
But… We don't have much time…
…Urgh! Then we shouldn't have come here in the first place!
Yeah!
OK, Mon Frère, let's go to another room!
Yeah, let's. Where should we go next?
Sorry, Ogami, but each customer is only allowed to purchase one photo at a time.
I see. That's too bad.
