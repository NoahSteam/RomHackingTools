Hmm… What in the world is wrong with Orihime? 
…All right! Guess I’ll try checking up on her. 
(Hmm? Who could that be?) 
Yes, this is Ogami. Who's there? 
Um, it's Sakura. Can I talk to you for a minute? 
Sakura? Hold on, I'm coming out. 
Hey, Sakura, what do you need? 
R-Right. Um... Ogami? 
Would you mind... taking this? 
What's this? A scarf? 
Did you make this, Sakura? 
Yes. I knitted it with red yarn, your favorite color. 
Yes. I knitted it with yellow yarn, your favorite color. 
Yes. I knitted it with blue yarn, your favorite color. 
I see. So that's why you were asking me about which colors I liked. 
Yes, I made the scarf little by little, so that you wouldn't notice. 
One time, you almost caught me knitting it in my room; I was so nervous. 
Sakura... 
I'll take good care of it. 
Thank you. 
I'll take good care of it. 
I'm so touched! 
Thank you, Sakura. I'll take good care of it, always. 
Ogami... 
I'm so glad to hear that. 
Thank you for accepting it. 
Um... I don't really know how to put this, but... thank you. 
Ogami... 
Seeing you happy like this is more than enough. 
Thank you for accepting it. 
I'm so touched! I can't believe you'd knit a scarf, just for me! 
That's... kind of going overboard, Ogami. 
But I'm glad you're happy. 
Sakura... 
Ogami? 
Oh, s-sorry. This is just so sudden. I'm a little surprised, that's all. 
Will you accept it, Ogami? 
Yes, it'd be my pleasure. Thank you, Sakura. 
I was so worried. I didn't know what I'd do if you didn't like it. 
I'm so glad I went through with it and gave you the scarf. 
Sakura... 
All right, Ogami, I should get going. 
Thank you for the scarf. I mean it. 
Of course! Please excuse me. 
The people on the street are dressed in their fall fashions. 
The mornings and evenings have gotten so cold. Winter's almost here. 
My ticket-punching duties for our autumn production went smoothly, thanks to all the practice I got. 
I guess practice DOES make perfect, huh? 
Nobody here in the lobby. 
Oh well, better go somewhere else. 
Oh, Mr. Ogami! Welcome! 
Why not buy a bromide while you're here? 
Oh, Mr. Ogami! Welcome! 
Buy a bromide. 
Talk to Tsubomi. 
Leave. 
All right, I'll take a bromide. 
Um, Mr. Ogami? I'm afraid I can only sell you one bromide at a time. 
We have to leave some for the customers, I hope you understand. 
Buying a bromide? Thank you very much! 
That's Sakura's bromide. 
Sakura's bromide? That'll be 50 sen! Thank you, come again! 
That's Sumire's bromide. 
Sumire's bromide? That'll be 50 sen! Thank you, come again! 
That's Maria's bromide. 
Maria's bromide? That'll be 50 sen! Thank you, come again! 
That's Kanna's bromide. 
Kanna's bromide? That'll be 50 sen! Thank you, come again! 
That's Iris's bromide. 
Iris's bromide? That'll be 50 sen! Thank you, come again! 
That's Kohran's bromide. 
Kohran's bromide? That'll be 50 sen! Thank you, come again! 
That's Orihime's bromide. 
Orihime's bromide? That'll be 50 sen! Thank you, come again! 
That's Reni's bromide. 
Reni's bromide? That'll be 50 sen! Thank you, come again! 
Oh, not buying a bromide after all? 
How was running the shop last month during our autumn production? 
The customers just wouldn't stop coming! It was super hectic! 
So hectic I had to ask Yuri and Kasumi for help... 
We were so busy, my head started spinning! 
That makes sense. It was your first time running the shop during one of our performances, after all. 
Tsubaki really is something else! I can't believe she can manage all that by herself! 
I'm not up to Tsubaki's level just yet... 
But while she's out, I'm gonna do my very best to keep this shop running! 
I see. Good luck, Tsubomi. 
Seeing you punch tickets during the fall production was truly breathtaking, Mr. Ogami! 
R-Really, now? Thanks. 
All right, I have to get going. Good luck with your work. 
Thanks for your patronage! Come again! 
Thanks for your patronage! Make sure to buy a bromide next time! 
The dining hall was packed with customers during our fall production last month. 
The theater's modern menu is apparently quite popular with our patrons. 
Hmm, nobody here. Oh well. Guess I'll go somewhere else. 
Oh, if it isn't Kanna. 
Yo, Boss! I was thinkin' about starting a bonfire in the courtyard with all the dead leaves. 
Heheh, you know what that means, right? 
Baked sweet potatoes? 
Grilled fish? 
Smoke signals? 
If we're lighting an autumn bonfire… That means baked sweet potatoes, right? 
Exactly! You're a sharp one, aren't ya, Boss? 
A bonfire, huh? Are we gonna grill some fish? 
Ahaha, what are ya talkin' about? A bonfire in the fall means we’re bakin’ sweet potatoes! 
R-Right. That's true. 
You plan on making smoke signals, right? 
Yeah, to reach my dad up in heaven... 
Kanna... 
Just kiddin’! Of course not. 
A bonfire in the fall means we’re bakin’ sweet potatoes!
Seriously, though... You caught me off guard with that one. 
Well, I managed to stay one step ahead of ya, at least. 
Too bad, time's up! 
If we're lightin’ a bonfire in the fall, then we gotta bake sweet potatoes! 
R-Right. That's true. 
You oughta swing by the courtyard around 2:30. 
Sakura and Kohran both said they'd be there, so let's all eat some baked potatoes together. 
All right, I'll stop by if I have time. 
Hey, Kanna. Getting the sweet potatoes ready? 
Yeah, I'm havin’ trouble findin’ good ones, I'm still lookin’. 
Relax, though. I think I'll be able to find some in time for 2:30. 
Kanna's in the courtyard, right? I should swing by and see. 
Doesn't look like anyone's here. 
Oh well, guess I'll go somewhere else. 
The entrance here was jam packed during our autumn production last month. 
Now that I think about it, I believe Navy Minister Yamaguchi came to see the play too…
We'll have to make sure our next show is just as good so people will return in droves to see it.
Seems like no one's here. I'll check somewhere else. 
Oh, Ogami. Did you need something? 
You came for my spicy gossip, right? 
Oh, Ogami. Hello again. 
If it's gossip you're after, I'm all out at the moment. Sorry! 
I see. That's too bad. 
I'll have plenty of stories for you later, so you can look forward to that! 
Hey, Yuri and Kasumi. 
Oh, Ogami. Did you need something? 
I've got a bunch of new gossip! I can tell you, if you want. 
Listen to some gossip. 
I’ll come back later. 
Sorry, I'm all out of gossip at the moment. 
I see. That's too bad. 
I'll have some more interesting tidbits to share another time, so look forward to it!
Everyone in the Flower Division sure has been working hard lately. 
Yeah, they've been busy both on stage and on the battlefield, but they've been doing well. 
I know some members have been up late training. 
Huh? Who? 
Heehee, that's a secret! 
(Up late, huh? Who could that be?) 
“The Blue Bird" last month was amazing! 
I found Reni's performance as Tyltyl especially moving. 
I think Reni really resonated with Tyltyl searching for the blue bird. 
We got a ton of patrons, too, it was a huge hit! 
Oh yeah, that's right! I have a special scoop for you, Ogami. 
Mysterious torii gates have been spotted all over the capital! Isn't that crazy? 
Mysterious torii gates? What do you mean? 
There've been several cases of torii gates suddenly appearing at certain spots throughout the capital. 
The locals seem happy about them, going so far as to call them "good omens"... 
But who exactly built them? That's a lot of effort if it's all just a prank. 
Hmm... That is kind of concerning. 
That reminds me, how was the autumn festival, Ogami? 
...Good. It was pretty lively, and there were lots of stalls set up. 
Wow, that sounds nice. Wish I could've gone. 
Hm hm, I'm afraid that's just how it is, Yuri. 
We can't exactly leave our posts when it's so busy around here. 
Yeah, I know. What a bore... 
That's too bad. Well, I'm sure you'll be able to make it to the next one. 
That reminds me, Reni's looking a lot happier these days. 
You're right. She's even started properly greeting me. 
People really can change, can't they? 
Hm hm, that's true. 
The mornings and evenings have gotten pretty chilly lately. 
Our autumn production was a huge success. 
Now the only performance left for this year is our Christmas play. 
We'll have to start getting ready ourselves, soon. 
Now that Reni's cheered up, Orihime's the only one left giving you problems, right? 
Uh, hmm... I guess so, yeah. 
She still hates Japanese men, doesn't she? 
...Yeah. Still don't know why, either. 
Hey, Ogami, do you know about the violinist spotted around town? 
Violinist? 
Yes, I saw him myself on my way home from shopping. 
He sings satirical songs about the state of the world, he's quite interesting. 
I see. Maybe I'll give him a listen when I have the chance. 
Would you like me to give you Tsubaki's number, Ogami? 
Huh?! You know it? 
Yes, she's been given her own transceiver for emergency contact. 
Tsubaki's number is “13600.” 
13600... There, I wrote it down. 
Try giving her a call every now and then, OK? 
I'll be back. Good luck with the rest of your work. 
OK. Thanks for coming, Ogami. 
Tell us if you hear any juicy stories! 
I wonder if the manager's in... 
Guess I'll go somewhere else. 
Are you there, sir? It's Ogami. 
... 
Huh? Doesn't sound like he's there. 
Are you there, sir? It's Ogami. 
... 
Guess he's not in. He must still be in the war room. 
I thought I might find Orihime here. 
Guess she's in her room. 
Orihime's not here. 
Oh well. Guess I'll check somewhere else. 
The costumes played a huge role in the success of our autumn production.
I wonder how many costumes are in here, anyway. 
Hmmm... Nobody's here, eh? 
Oh well. Guess I'll go somewhere else. 
Rehearsals are done for the day, so nobody's in the dressing room. 
No use sticking around here. Might as well go elsewhere. 
Thought I'd come here a little later, but there’s still no one around. 
Oh well. I'll try another room. 
Oh, Ogami... 
Thanks for earlier, Sakura. 
D-Don't mention it... 
What on earth is he talking about, Sakura? 
N-Nothing! Nothing at all! 
B-By the way, what are you two up to? 
Oh, Ogami. 
Oh my, Ensign. It's quite unusual to see you here. 
What are you two up to? 
We were just talking about Reni. 
She put on such a wonderful performance last month. 
More importantly, she's so much more cheerful than before. 
That's really great. 
This is only the beginning. 
She's cute when she smiles. 
That's really great. Reni's finally opened up. 
Now she can be a true member of the Flower Division. 
Yes, I think so too. I hope we can keep getting along like this. 
Indeed, it's wonderful to see. 
This is only the beginning. The door to Reni's heart has been locked shut for a long time. 
She's only just begun to pry open that door herself. 
From here on out, we need to keep giving Reni our support. 
I think you might be right, Ensign. 
Considering all she's been through, there's no way her heart could heal in just a single day. 
Right. We'll have to keep doing our best, then, for Reni’s sake. 
I was just thinking... Reni's pretty cute when she smiles. 
Ensign, while I certainly don't object to Reni being called "cute"... 
We were having a more serious discussion. Please refrain from making jokes. 
She's right, Ogami. 
You've been saying that sort of thing a lot lately, haven't you? 
There's a time and place for making jokes. 
Oh... S-Sorry. I guess I overdid it a little. 
... 
What's the matter, Ensign? 
Perhaps you're worried about Orihime? 
True, you two don't seem to get along very well. 
But Reni opened up to us. 
I'm sure Orihime will open up to you too, someday. 
Hmmm... 
Anyway, I let Reni have the lead role this time. 
But next time, I shall be the star! Ohohohoho! 
You sure are fired up, Sumire! 
Will you be practicing on the stage tonight, like you usually do? 
S-Sakura! I thought you promised not to tell anyone! 
Oh! S-Sorry! It just slipped out... 
Honestly, I swear... Ensign, forget everything you just heard from her. 
And with that, I must be going. 
Oh, that's right. I'll be waiting for you in the salon, Ensign. 
And I have plans to be in the courtyard from 2:30 onward. Please excuse me, Ogami. 
... 
Everyone was really worried about Reni, huh. 
Looks like rehearsals are over for today. 
Right, I should head somewhere else. 
The fantastical sets in "The Blue Bird" were the subject of much praise. 
The power of set design truly cannot be understated. 
Hmmm... Nobody's here, eh? 
Well, nobody really comes here without a good reason, anyway. 
Rehearsals are done for today and nobody's on stage. 
Guess I'll get going, then. 
On top of being a big hit, "The Blue Bird" was Reni's first starring role here at the theater. 
Leave it to the Flower Division to pack the seats in both the summer and fall. 
Doesn't look like any of the others are here. 
Oh well. Guess I'll go somewhere else. 
Oh, there's Reni. Hey, Reni! 
...Captain. 
And the little guy should be here any second now... 
Arf arf arf! 
Dog value change. Change change change. Assign assign assign...
There he is. Over here, Shiro! 
There he is. Over here, Hanamaru! 
There he is. Over here, Dai! 
There he is. Over here, Torte! 
There he is. Over here, Long! 
There he is. Over here, Altair! 
There he is. Over here, Hund! 
Arf arf! 
... 
Reni... 
Look, Reni, Shiro wants to play. He wants to be friends with you. 
Look, Reni, Hanamaru wants to play. He wants to be friends with you. 
Look, Reni, Dai wants to play. He wants to be friends with you. 
Look, Reni, Torte wants to play. He wants to be friends with you. 
Look, Reni, Long wants to play. He wants to be friends with you. 
Look, Reni, Altair wants to play. He wants to be friends with you. 
Look, Reni, Hund wants to play. He wants to be friends with you. 
... 
With the way you are now, I'm sure you can reciprocate Shiro's feelings. 
With the way you are now, I'm sure you can reciprocate Hanamaru's feelings. 
With the way you are now, I'm sure you can reciprocate Dai's feelings. 
With the way you are now, I'm sure you can reciprocate Torte's feelings. 
With the way you are now, I'm sure you can reciprocate Long's feelings. 
With the way you are now, I'm sure you can reciprocate Altair's feelings. 
With the way you are now, I'm sure you can reciprocate Hund's feelings. 
C'mon, Reni. Try playing with him. 
C'mon, Reni. Try playing with him. 
C'mon, Reni. Try playing with him. 
C'mon, Reni. Try playing with him. 
C'mon, Reni. Try playing with him. 
C'mon, Reni. Try playing with him. 
C'mon, Reni. Try playing with him. 
C'mon, Reni. Try playing with him. 
... 
...OK. 
Shiro... 
Hanamaru... 
Dai... 
Torte... 
Long... 
Altair... 
Hund... 
Arf arf arf! 
Your eyes are so gentle, and your body is so warm... 
Woof! 
Does this mean... You accept me the way I am? 
Arf arf! 
Hahaha! I'm pretty sure that means, "Of course I do"! 
...Thank you, Shiro. 
...Thank you, Hanamaru. 
...Thank you, Dai. 
...Thank you, Torte. 
...Thank you, Long. 
...Thank you, Altair. 
...Thank you, Hund. 
... 
Shiro really trusts you now. Isn't that great, Reni? 
Hanamaru really trusts you now. Isn't that great, Reni? 
Dai really trusts you now. Isn't that great, Reni? 
Torte really trusts you now. Isn't that great, Reni? 
Long really trusts you now. Isn't that great, Reni? 
Altair really trusts you now. Isn't that great, Reni? 
Hund really trusts you now. Isn't that great, Reni? 
He's accepted you as his friend. 
Yeah... Thank you, Captain. 
Oh, looks like everyone's started on the bonfire. 
Arf arf! 
Hahaha... 
is with you too, I see. 
Hey, Boss. Drawn by the smell of sweet potatoes, eh? 
We were just talkin’ about your grilled fish thing from earlier. 
Thinking about fish before sweet potatoes sounds pretty fitting for you, coming from the Navy. 
Good grief, didn't think that'd spark a whole conversation. 
We were just talkin’ about your smoke signal thing from earlier. 
Trying to make smoke signals from a bonfire like this? You're hilarious, Chief! 
Good grief, didn't think that'd spark a whole conversation. 
So, we're right in the middle of autumn now. 
In Japan, they say, "Fall is for something-or-other"... What is fall to you, Chief? 
"Fall is for reading." 
"Fall is for the arts." 
"Fall is for sports." 
Hmmm, I guess "fall is for reading," in my case. 
Ooh, nice, Chief! I'd say the same thing. 
Though I guess in my case, it's more like "fall is for inventing." 
So that includes inventin’ phrases, too, huh? You're hopeless. 
Hmmm, I guess "fall is for the arts," in my case. 
That's true, I feel like I can really throw myself into my rehearsals at this time of year. 
What arts do you practice, Chief? Doesn't really sound like your thing. 
Hmmm, I guess "fall is for sports," in my case. 
Right? Right? Ya gotta get your blood pumpin’ in the fall! 
CHESTOHHHH! All right, who's down for a quick spar?! 
K-Kanna, please mind the bonfire. 
Hmmm... I don't know what I'd say. 
Oh! Looks like the sweet potatoes are just about ready. 
You're right! 
They look tasty! 
All right, everyone, dig in! 
Arf arf! 
I guess in our case, "fall is for eating," huh? 
Heehee, you're right! Now let's eat. 
Phew, nothing like a sweet potato cooked over a bonfire. 
Well, I'm stuffed now. I'd better get going. 
Looks like everyone's chitchatting while gathered around the fire. 
I'd get too distracted if I joined in. I'll just go somewhere else. 
The bonfire in the courtyard's starting at 2:30, right? 
Looks like I'm a little too early. I'll come back a bit later. 
All the leaves in the courtyard have fallen. Autumn has truly arrived.
In just two months, the whole year will be over. 
Oh, if it ain't the chief. 
Hey Kohran. What are you up to? 
Reni's gonna do some diving training in the pool starting at 2:30. 
I actually just got back from dropping off some custom-made training equipment for her. 
As for me, though, I'll be in the courtyard at 2:30 with Sakura and Kanna, lighting up a bonfire. 
I see. How seasonally appropriate. 
Right? Heheh, you can come if you want, Chief. 
Sure, I'll be there. 
I'm kinda busy... 
Sure, I'll be there.
I'm kinda busy... 
What's with the outfit?
Sure, I'll be there. It's been ages since I've lit a bonfire. 
That's the spirit, Chief! 
I'm sure you're busy, though, so you don't have to come if you can't make it. 
Just pop your head in if you got the time. Well, see ya, Chief. 
A bonfire, huh? Sounds kinda fun. 
I'll drop by for a bit, if I can make it. 
Hm... I'm kinda busy right now... 
I understand. I won't force you to come if you're busy. 
Stop on by if you got the time, though. All right, see ya, Chief. 
A bonfire, huh? Sounds kinda fun. 
I'll drop by for a bit, if I can make it. 
Say, what's with that outfit? It's different from what you usually wear. 
Heheh, just a seasonal change of clothes. It's gotten pretty cold out. 
Well, Chief? Do you... like it? 
It looks great on you. 
You kinda look like a boy. 
I prefer your usual outfit.
It looks great on you, Kohran. 
For real, Chief? 
Yeah, seriously. I think you look good in it. 
Thanks a bunch, Chief. I'm super glad to hear it. 
I was actually kinda worried about what you'd say, but I'm glad I wore it after all. 
Hahaha, seriously, though, it looks great. 
...All right, Chief, I oughta get going. 
Thanks for the compliment. 
I didn't think she'd be that happy about it. 
Well, I should get going too. 
Umm... You kinda look like a boy. 
I guess that's true... I'm not super pretty like the other girls in the Flower Division. 
But when it comes to sheer moxie, nobody's got me beat! 
...Though I guess that's kinda boyish of me, too, huh? Ahahahaha! 
Well, I think it's a nice outfit. It suits you. 
Thanks a bunch, Chief. I like it, too. 
I think it's perfect for me the way I am. 
...All right, Chief, I oughta get going. 
Come swing by the courtyard later if you got the time. 
It's not her usual cheongsam, but she doesn't look bad dressed like that, either. 
A seasonal change, huh? Winter's right around the corner. 
Hmm, if I had to choose... I think I like your usual outfit better. 
So you don't like it, huh... 
S-Sorry... 
Eh, it's fine... After all, I hate lies just like I hate natto. 
I'd rather you tell me the truth than try to flatter me. 
...Well, see ya, Chief. Come by the courtyard later if you got time. 
Kohran took that well, but I think I might've gone a little too far. 
Oh well, too late to regret it now. I should go, too. 
What's with the long pause, Chief? 
S-Sorry, I was, uh, trying to think of what to say. 
If you like it, just say you like it. If you don't, just say you don't. 
You really are as wishy-washy as ever. 
S-Sorry... 
...Eh, that's part of what makes you you, though. 
...Well, see ya, Chief. Come by the courtyard later if you got time. 
Actually, all the others have changed their outfits too, huh? We're right in the middle of autumn. 
Right, I should get going. I'll stop by the courtyard if I have the time. 
What's up, Chief? You look out of it. 
Oh, s-sorry, I just got lost in thought. 
I should be the one apologizing, bothering you while you're so busy. 
Well, see ya, Chief. Stop by the courtyard later if you got time. 
Well, I should get going too. 
Maybe I'll drop by the courtyard later if I have time. 
3 o'clock already, huh? 
I can't just keep ignoring Orihime. 
OK, I'll head to her room and have a talk with her. 
Oh, Captain. 
Hey, Reni. What are you up to? 
I like to come up here sometimes and look at the city. 
But it feels different today... 
I feel... calm, somehow. I've never felt this way before. 
Reni... 
It's because of the season.
It's because you changed. 
It must be because the seasons have changed. 
You can see the signs of fall all over the capital. 
Can't you feel it in the autumn breeze? 
I guess so... Seasons are simply a natural phenomenon, though. 
Well, we're not gonna get our answer out here. Let's head back inside. 
...OK. 
It must be because you've changed. 
...I have? 
This is the city we live in... 
A city full of important things we're sworn to protect. 
You may not have thought of it that way before... 
But your perspective must be changing, little by little. 
... 
There's no rush, you can take all the time you need to find the answers. 
I know you can find them, Reni. 
Captain... 
All right, you'll catch a cold if you stay out here too long. Let's head back inside. 
...OK. 
I'm not sure why you feel that way, either. 
I'm sure you'll figure it out on your own. 
... 
There's no rush, Reni, you can take your time to find the answers. 
I know you can find them. 
Captain... 
All right, you'll catch a cold if you stay out here too long. Let's head back inside. 
...OK. 
A fall breeze drifts throughout the capital…
Only two months left before the year is over. So long yet so short at the same time... 
The hall here was packed with patrons for our autumn production last month. 
The Flower Division's popularity truly is something to behold. 
It's so quiet, as though the fervor around last month's performance never happened. 
Nobody's here, so I should head to another room. 
Ensign, I've been waiting for you. 
Might I ask you for another tea brewing lesson today, Sumire? 
Oh, I won't be teaching you anything this time, Ensign. 
Today will instead be a test on how well you can prepare a cup of tea yourself. 
Huh?! This is way too soon. 
Nonsense. There is such a thing as talent, you know. 
If you have the talent, then I know you can do it. 
And if you can't, well, that means you have no talent. 
Hmmm... Guess I don't have a choice, then. 
All right, Sumire, I'll give it a shot. 
Then let us begin. I have prepared here the tea and hot water. 
Now, Ensign, what do you do? 
(I'm pretty sure I'm supposed to heat the cup first, right?) 
Pour the tea. 
Pour the hot water. 
Pour the tea. 
Pour the hot water. 
For starters, you pour the tea into the cup. 
Ensign, have you forgotten already? 
You warm the cup first by pouring hot water into it. 
It's the very first thing I taught you, the most fundamental of fundamentals. 
Oh, right. I totally forgot. 
You wait a little bit, then pour the tea. 
Ensign, have you forgotten already? 
You warm the cup first by pouring hot water into it. 
It's the very first thing I taught you, the most fundamental of fundamentals. 
Oh, right. I totally forgot. 
You wait a little bit, then pour the hot water. 
Ensign, have you forgotten already? 
You warm the cup first by pouring hot water into it. 
You were doing it in the correct order, but you took a little too long. 
Oh, right. I totally forgot. 
Uh... What do I do, again? 
Ensign, have you forgotten already? 
You warm the cup first by pouring hot water into it. 
It's the very first thing I taught you, the most fundamental of fundamentals. 
Oh, right. I totally forgot. 
First, you pour the hot water into the cup to warm it. 
Then you wait a little bit until the tea leaves have opened, then you pour the tea. 
... 
There's a trick to pouring it, too. 
Pour it quickly. 
Pour it slowly. 
Pour to the last drop. 
(Let's try pouring it quickly) 
Oh, Ensign, what a shame. You were so close. 
For black tea, you have to gradually pour it out till the very last drop. 
I taught you about the final "Golden Drop," remember? 
Oh, that's right. I totally forgot. 
(OK, I'll pour it out slowly.) 
That's far too slow, Ensign. 
If you take that long to pour it, the tea will be far too bitter by the end. 
O-Oh. Looks like I messed up. 
Ensign! If you wait too long, the tea will become bitter! 
Oh, it's too late now. What a shame. 
O-Oh. Looks like I messed up. 
(You carefully pour it all to the very last drop.) 
... 
OK, that's all of it! 
Sumire, would you like to try the tea I've prepared? 
Excellent, Ensign. Your brewing technique is flawless. 
Now to see just how much of your heart you've poured into it. 
Let's have a taste. 
... 
... 
...My! It's so delicious! 
Your impeccable technique has truly drawn out the flavor and aroma. 
But more importantly, I simply feel content while drinking it. 
Huh, I wonder why that is. 
Without question, it’s because you prepared this tea with love. 
A cup of black tea, prepared by you, just for me... The only one of its kind in the entire world. 
I will never forget the taste of this tea for as long as I live. 
Sumire... 
Thank you, Ensign. 
It seems I have nothing left to teach you about making tea. 
I'm glad I could make you happy. 
Well then, I have to go. Take it easy, Sumire. 
Good day, Ensign. Thank you for the delicious tea. 
I guess I just don't have the talent for this after all... 
... 
Like I said at the beginning, talent is important, obviously. 
But I never overlook effort, either. 
I know how much work you've put into this over the past few months. 
Besides, this tea had a rather unique taste to it. 
I'd say this was a good first step. You passed the test, Ensign. 
Sumire... Thank you. 
Well then, I have to go. Take it easy, Sumire. 
Take care, Ensign. 
Oh, Sumire's here. 
Oh, Ensign. 
I just passed by Orihime a short while ago. 
She seemed quite upset about something. 
What on earth happened to her? 
... 
Tell her what happened.
Actually, she's been like that ever since the festival. 
She ran straight home after we talked to a portrait artist there. 
He seemed to recognize her, too. I wonder what that was all about? 
Is that truly what happened? 
That being said... 
I can't say I approve of you speaking about other people's private matters unprompted. 
Y-You're right, sorry. That was careless of me. 
At any rate, it seems like it's your time to shine, Ensign. 
Please help Orihime. 
Guess Sumire does worry about the others after all. 
All right, I'd better get going. 
... 
I'm a little concerned, but this IS Orihime we're talking about. I suppose there's no need to worry. 
Besides, I'm sure you can help her with whatever her problem is. 
Now then, I was in the middle of making myself some tea, so if you'd please excuse me. 
Hmm... Something's definitely bugging Orihime. 
I'll have to head to her room sometime later. 
Sumire's still enjoying her tea, I see. 
I don't want to bother her, so I'll back off. 
I thought I might find someone here, but I guess not. 
Oh well. I'll try another room. 
Guess it's not time for Sumire's tea lessons yet. I'll come back later. 
Think you'll let me win at billiards today, Maria? 
Hm hm, you have improved a lot, Captain, that much is true. 
Well then, let's begin. Go easy on me, Captain. 
It's your turn, Captain. You're in a tough spot. 
Shoot... The next ball's totally blocked off. 
If I get a foul now, I'll lose. Hmm... 
(Maybe if I tried that jump shot Maria showed me back then...) 
Attempt a jump shot. 
Give up. 
Nope, can't do it. This is way beyond me. 
Getting a foul would end me, too, so I'll just give up. 
... 
I can't do it, and no amount of thinking will change that fact.
Getting a foul would end me, too, so I'll just give up. 
... 
So that's yet another loss, huh? Being stuck with a foul there really hurt. 
Seems your luck ran out. 
In the end, I couldn't beat you. 
But you've still improved a lot, sir. 
I hadn't played billiards in a long time, myself, so this was quite fun for me. 
Thanks, Maria. All right, I should get going, then. 
OK. Good work, Captain. 
All right... I'm gonna try a jump shot. 
Huh?! Captain, I don't think you're ready yet. 
It's true, it might be too hard for me at my current skill level... 
But so long as there's a chance, I want to at least try. 
I can give up whenever I want, after all. 
Captain... 
Right, here goes. <br> 1... 2... 
There! 
Gwargh!! 
C-Captain!! 
Ow... My forehead... 
Captain! Are you all right?! 
Not... really... No... 
Ow ow ow... That stings. 
Please stay still, sir. 
I can't believe I hit my face instead of the ball. 
... 
But you faced the challenge head-on till the very end, and I think that's wonderful. 
Come to think of it… You've always managed to turn the tables, no matter the odds, without ever giving up. 
You have a strong heart, able to face seemingly impossible challenges without backing down. 
I feel like... I'm the one who learned something today. 
Maria... 
Still, it was pretty reckless of you to attempt a jump shot. 
You could have skipped that last comment, Maria…  
There, all done with first aid, Captain. 
Thanks, Maria. 
I wasn't able to beat you in the end, but it still made for some good memories. 
Yes. I always looked forward to our trips to the game room these past three months. 
If you ever have the chance, you should challenge me again. All right, I have to go now.
Never giving up till the very end, huh...? 
Well, my forehead's mostly stopped hurting, so I think I'll get going too. 
Maria taught me billiards in here these past three months. 
I wasn't able to beat her in the end, but we made some good memories. 
Nobody's here. 
Oh well, I'll check another room. 
Phew... Nothing calms you down like sitting in your own room. 
OK, what to do next? 
Call someone. 
Go somewhere else. 
Yeah, I think I'll take a break and call someone. 
I think I'll go somewhere else. 
OK, who to call? 
Hello? This is Tsubaki Takamura. 
Hey, Tsubaki? It's me, Ogami. 
Huh? Ogami! How'd you get my number? 
Yuri told me, actually. 
Oh, I see! I'm just a little surprised, getting called out of the blue like this. 
I just kept trying numbers till I found it. 
Really? Well thanks for going through all that trouble! 
OK, let's talk on the big screen! 
Wow, I can see you so clearly! 
Same here, I can see you very well on my end. 
Really? This feels kinda different from our usual chats at the shop.
By the way, Ogami, did you need something from me? 
Tell her "good luck." 
Ask what she's doing. 
Ask her out on a date. 
I won't ask about what you're doing, but good luck all the same, Tsubaki. 
Y-Yes, sir! Thank you! 
I can't tell you what I'm working on, due to the nature of this assignment... 
But with you cheering me on, I know I'll do my best! 
I know I've asked this before, but... what exactly are you up to? 
I'm sorry. I can't tell you, not under any circumstances. 
I see… 
... 
…All right, Ogami, how about this? I'll tell you where I am, but that's it. 
Right now, I'm at the Imperial Assault Troupe's Hokkaido Headquarters. 
Huh? Hokkaido?! 
Yes. I can't say any more than that. Sorry. 
Tsubaki, when you get back, how about we go on a date? 
Huh? Are you serious, Ogami? 
OK, once I get back, I'll make sure to invite you out, then! 
No, nothing in particular. I just wanted to talk to you. 
O-Ogami... 
... 
... 
I... Um... I should go. Got work to do, bye! 
Ah! Tsubaki! 
*sigh*... <br> She hung up. 
At any rate, I wonder where she is and what she's doing? 
All right, Ogami, I'm in the middle of work, so I have to go. 
Tell everyone at the theater I said hi! 
Sure. Good luck with your work! 
Thank you! Call me again sometime! 
Tsubaki really is working her hardest, isn't she. 
But still, I wonder what she's doing? 
Hello? This is Tsubaki Takamura. 
Hello, this is Ogami. 
Oh, Ogami! You called again! 
OK, let's switch to the big screen. 
Hey Tsubaki, how goes work? 
Apparently my job here is almost done. 
Your temporary replacement, Tsubomi, has been working pretty hard, too. 
Really? I'd love to speak with her once I get back. 
Um, what kind of girl is Tsubomi, anyway? 
She's a go-getter. 
She's a klutz. 
She's a cutie. 
She's a real go-getter, if nothing else. 
Really? That's a relief. 
No matter the job, a good worker will give it their all. 
If she tries her hardest, then I'm sure the customers will recognize that. 
She's cheerful, but kind of a klutz, too. 
That's fine! Nothing's more important than cheer when it comes to running the shop. 
I mean, I'm pretty clumsy myself, anyway. 
(I don't think you two are quite on the same level of clumsiness, though...) 
She dresses kind of strangely, but she's pretty cute. 
Really? Heh, I can't wait to meet her. 
Hmm... I don't know how to put it... 
Oh, it's fine, Ogami. 
That means I'll just have more to look forward to once I finally meet her! 
All right, Ogami, I should get back to work. 
Right. Good luck. 
Thank you! All right then, talk to you later! 
All right, what next? 
... 
Tsubaki's not picking up. She must be back at work. 
Good afternoon. It's time for Capital News. 
Today we begin with a report on infighting within the Imperial Assault Troop. 
This shocking development was first brought to light in last month's battle in Ikebukuro. 
Unique Spirit Armor models appeared within the troop's ranks earlier this year in May... 
But according to eyewitness reports, one armor was seen fighting against the Flower Division's Koubu. 
Continuing our story on the Imperial Assault Troop's infighting at Ikebukuro. 
The incident occurred amid stormy weather from the landfall of the recent typhoon. However…
...Soon after, the Spirit Armor that was attacking the troop was later seen fighting alongside them.
As a result, there are doubts as to whether or not any infighting had actually occurred. 
We await official confirmation from the Army and the Metropolitan Police Department. 
Up next, are YOU aware of the latest craze sweeping the capital? 
The answer is ballroom dancing. Dancing has been all the rage with the youth lately. 
The establishments where these youths congregate to dance are referred to as "dance halls."
However, these dance halls have been frowned upon by conservative groups and the elderly... 
They have condemned these places as "promoting frivolous trends among today's youth." 
However, regardless of their negative reputation... 
...it looks like the capital's dance halls will nevertheless be packed once again this evening. 
Finally, it's time for this week's weather forecast. 
The air in the capital has grown quite brisk, as the skies are dotted with cirrocumulus clouds. 
This clear autumn weather is expected to last for the next several days. 
In the Tohoku region, the rice harvest has finally begun. 
Our listeners at home might want to consider spending their days off basking in the autumn leaves. 
That's it for Capital News, brought to you by the Capital Daily Report. 
That concludes today's broadcast. We hope you will look forward to tomorrow's programming. 
A red shadow opposes the evildoers lurking in the darkness of the capital. His name is Masked Red! 
Masked Red, the boy wonder of justice! Today he continues his fight for peace in the capital! 
Serial Radio Drama Masked Red, Special Episode: The Seven Secrets of Masked Red, Part One

Masked Red's Secrets, #2: Masked Red's Enemies 
Masked Red fights against evildoers who plot to conquer the capital. 
The brilliant mad scientist Dr. Kurogane and the evil gentleman Skull X are among his strongest foes. 
Masked Red's Secrets, #3: Masked Red's Strength

Masked Red never misses a single shot with his two Colt 1911's. He never lets his mark escape. 
Tune in next time as we uncover more of Masked Red's secrets! 
Go, Masked Red! Fight on, Masked Red! Tune in next time! 
I'm getting worried about Orihime. I should shut this thing off. 
All right, where to next? 
Oops, that time already, huh? 
I should stop with the calls and talk to Orihime already. 
Orihime's most likely in her room. 
Right, I should go and talk to her. 
I wonder if Kaede's in her room right now? 
Guess I'll go somewhere else. 
It's Ogami. Are you there, Kaede? 
Oh, Ogami. The door's unlocked, come in. 
Right. Pardon me. 
Welcome, Ogami. Did you need something?  
Have a chat. 
Ask about Ayame. 
Nothing in particular. 
That reminds me, you went to the autumn festival with the others, right? 
Yeah. There were all kinds of stalls there, it was fun. 
We're deep into fall now. 
That reminds me, Sakura and the others said they'd be lighting a bonfire in the courtyard at 2:30. 
Why not go see for yourself, if you haven't already.
Yeah, I already went. We ate baked sweet potatoes together. 
Ahaha, sounds like fun. I'm glad you're all getting along. 
If it's all right with you, I'd like to ask you about Ayame. 
Why, of course. Hmm... What should I talk about? 
No, nothing in particular. 
Oh, really? Hm hm, you really are an odd one, Ogami. 
Well then, I'll excuse myself. 
You're always welcome here. 
All right. Well, I should get going. Please excuse me. 
I'm glad I could talk with her. I should stop by every now and then. 
It's Ogami. Are you there, Kaede? 
Oh, Ogami? 
I'm sorry, but my hands are full with writing these reports right now. 
I see. All right, I'll come back another time. 
Sorry, Ogami. Let's have a nice talk some other time.
Nobody's here, huh? Well, not like many people usually come here anyway. 
No use staying here. I should go. 
They say fall is for reading. Wouldn't hurt to read a book on occasion. 
Let's see, what kind of literature do we have here? 
"The Masked Boxer" Poems 
"Tactical Theory" Textbook 
“Dating Coach" Guidebook 
“The Masked Boxer"? Seems like an interesting anthology of poems. 
Written by Keiko Ubehira. A female author, huh? 
Oh, Captain. 
Looking for some fall reading? What book do you have there? 
Oh, this? It's a book called "The Masked Boxer." 
Reading anthologies now, Captain? You really are an avid reader. 
I love this author's passionate prose. 
I'd recommend taking your time to savor it. 
I see. All right, I'll give it a thorough read when I have the time. 
I think that's a great idea. 
Well then, I have to go. 
I'll be available to play billiards until 2:30. 
Figures Maria's already read this book. 
Right, I'll save the reading for later. Time to head somewhere else. 
“Tactical Theory," huh? Wouldn't hurt to do some studying on occasion, as captain of the troupe.
Oh, Captain. 
Looking for some fall reading? What book do you have there? 
Oh, this? It's a textbook called "Tactical Theory." 
Glad to see you're keeping up with your combat studies, Captain. 
But at six volumes in total, that book is quite the undertaking. 
Oh, really? I don't think I'll be able to finish it anytime soon, then. 
Well, I'll read it little by little whenever I have the time. 
I think that's a great idea. 
Well then, I have to go. 
I'll be available to play billiards until 2:30. 
Six volumes in total? The road to mastery sure isn't a short one... 
Right, I should get going, myself. 
This one's called... "Dating Coach"? 
Let's see... 
You, the guy who can't ask women out! You, the guy who worries about where to go on dates! 
This book is for you! 
What kind of book is this? Maybe I'll read just a little bit... 
Oh, Captain. 
Ah! Maria!! 
Looking for some fall reading? What book do you have there? 
Eeep?! 
..."Dating Coach"? 
“The ultimate dating guide. With this, her heart will be yours!" 
... 
I'm sorry for interrupting your precious reading time. 
M-Maria, this isn't, um... 
I have to go now. 
Of all the times for Maria to show up, it had to be when I'm holding this book... 
Oh well, can't help it if I'm unlucky, I guess. 
Hmm... There's so many books, I can't decide. 
Oh, Captain. 
Are you looking for a book? They say fall is for reading, after all. 
Yeah, but I'm having a hard time finding a good one. 
Indeed, it's not easy finding a good book. 
Sometimes, a book you've spent ages looking for will bore you. 
Other times, a book you picked up on a whim will totally engross you. 
True. I should take my time finding something to read. 
I think that's a great idea. 
Well then, I have to go. 
I'll be available to play billiards until 2:30.
That was some very readerly advice from Maria. 
Right, I should get going, myself. 
Hmm, nobody's here. 
Oh well. Guess I'll check somewhere else. 
I wonder if Reni is in her room.
...She's not here. 
Reni... Still using notebook paper as a nameplate, I see. 
OK, let's check another room. 
I wonder if Sakura’s in her room.
...She's not here. 
It's just like Sakura to have a cute nameplate like this. 
OK, let's check another room. 
I wonder if Kanna’s in her room.
...She's not here. 
Kanna's... Well, I guess it's more of a nametag than a nameplate. 
OK, let's check another room. 
I wonder if Orihime is in her room. 
...Who is it? 
It's Ogami. 
Um, what happened back at the festival? 
That's none of your business, Mr. Ensign! 
B-But... 
Quit butting in and leave me alone!! 
(Sheesh, couldn't get a word in edgewise...) 
Ah, Mr. Ogami! There you are! 
Tsubomi? What's the matter? 
It's just... There's a strange man loitering out front. 
He's just been standing there for a long time, staring at the theater. 
What should we do, Mr. Ogami? 
OK, got it. I'll take a look. 
That would be great! 
A simple yet classy nameplate. 
Let's go check another room. 
3 o'clock already, huh? 
I'll try knocking. I wonder if Orihime will answer... 
I wonder if Maria is in her room.
It's Maria's nameplate. 
OK, I'll check another room. 
Too bad, doesn't seem like she's here. 
Yes, who is it? 
It's Ogami. Do you have a moment? 
Captain? Come in, the door's open 
OK, then. Excuse me... 
Captain, I was just thinking about the Black Demon Society. 
The Black Demon Society? 
It's already been half a year since they first appeared in Ginza. 
And yet we still don't know what their true motives are. 
What do you think their end goal is, Captain? 
The capital's destruction? 
The troupe's defeat?
This is pure speculation, but maybe they want to destroy the capital? 
You think so too? I'm of the same opinion. 
It's just... We have no idea when or where they'll come from, nor what they plan on doing. 
This is pure speculation, but maybe they want to defeat the Imperial Assault Troupe? 
In that case, why didn't Suiko... Saki Kageyama kill us all when she had the chance? 
If they wanted us dead, they could have done so at any moment. 
Hmm... Now that you mention it, that's true too. 
The attempt on Yoneda's life, the freezing of our funding, and the espionage... 
They’re trying to strike us from the side rather than head on, as it were.
Perhaps there's a reason they can’t just attack us openly. 
What on earth could that reason be? 
I don't know. This is just speculation. 
Hmm... To be honest, I don't really know. 
Regardless, making baseless theories could be playing right into their hands. 
That's true. We should at least refrain from these discussions in front of the others. 
At any rate, we have a duty to protect the capital. 
We have to remain vigilant and not let our guard down. 
Yes, sir. 
Sorry for interrupting you while you were deep in thought. I'll be going now. 
No, thank you for having this discussion with me. 
The Black Demons' true motives... It's certainly shrouded in mystery. 
We have no idea where they'll show up next. All we can do is wait. 
Maria said earlier she was thinking about the Black Demon Society. 
I'll leave her alone. Wouldn't want to break her train of thought. 
I wonder if Iris is in her room.
So Iris's nameplate is shaped like Jean-Paul. 
Guess I'll go somewhere else. 
It's Ogami. Are you there, Iris? 
... 
I'm sorry about earlier. I won't ever look at you in the bath again. 
...Never ever? 
Yeah, I'll never do it again. 
...OK then, I forgive. I don't wanna fight with you anyway. 
OK, come in, Mon Frère! 
Uh-huh! I've been waiting for you, Mon Frère! 
OK, then. Excuse me... 
All right, Iris. Let's get started with your studies. 
Oh, I already did all my studying this morning, Mon Frère. 
Huh?! That's too bad... Or rather, that's great! 
Guess you don't need me here today, then. 
Ah, Mon Frère, wait a second! 
Um... I wrote you a letter. 
A letter? For me? 
Uh-huh. It's kind of embarrassing, but I want you to read it, OK? 
Mon Frère chéri, 
Thank you for all your help with my studies. 
You always woke me up when I was about to fall asleep. 
I'm sorry for getting so sleepy during my study time. 
You helped me learn my multiplication tables with marbles. 
You helped me learn my multiplication tables by memorizing them. 
You took a piece of paper with my multiplication tables and stuck it to my wall for me. 
Thanks to you, I was able to solve every math problem Auntie Kaede gave me. 
3 pages a day, 7 days a week... 
3 times 7... I was able to finish 21 pages a week. 
3 pages a day, 7 days a week... 
3 times 7... I was able to finish 28 pages a week. 
(Oh jeez, she's still getting it wrong.) 
Whenever you'd praise me at the end of our lessons... 
...it made me so happy. 
I still feel like crying sometimes when I get homework... 
But it feels great when I try my hardest and get it finished. 
There were times when I fell asleep right after studying… 
Remember how you tied our legs together to teach me what "cooperation" means? 
I hope we can keep "cooperating" together, Mon Frère! 
Remember how you drew that picture of the monkeys to teach me what "cooperation" means? 
I hope we can keep "cooperating" together, Mon Frère! 
Remember how you told me that story about the old couple to teach me what "cooperation" means? 
I hope we can keep "cooperating" together, Mon Frère! 
I hope we can keep "cooperating" together, Mon Frère! 
Imperial Assault Troupe, Flower Division... <br> -Iris 
Heheh! That's it. 
Iris... Thank you. 
Let's keep cooperating from here on out. 
OK! 
I can't believe Iris wrote me a letter like that. 
I'm... I'm getting a little emotional. 
I believe Iris said she already finished her studying earlier this morning. 
It's Ogami. Are you there, Iris? 
Snoooore... Snoooore... 
Sounds like she's napping. 
She must be exhausted after running around the festival today. 
I'll leave her alone. Wouldn't want to wake her up. 
I believe Iris was in the middle of a nap. I'll leave her alone for now. 
It's Ogami. Are you there, Iris? 
Guess she's not here. Oh well, I'll go someplace else. 
I wonder if Kohran’s in her room.
There's no response. Looks like she's somewhere else. 
A gear-shaped nameplate, huh? It's just Kohran's style. 
I'll go check a different room. 
I wonder if Sumire is in her room.
Nope, not here. 
This is a pretty subtle design, considering it's Sumire. 
I'll go check a different room. 
3 o'clock already, huh? 
I can't just keep ignoring Orihime. 
OK, I'll head to her room and have a talk with her. 
Oh, Ogami. What do you need? 
What were you doing just now, sir? 
Ah, I was just calling Tsubaki. 
Tsubaki? Calling about what? 
Oh, you know. 
... 
About work? 
About gossip? 
About work? 
About gossip? 
About the secret project? 
About gossip? 
Were you talking to her about work? 
Well, something like that. Making arrangements for the delivery date. 
Delivery date? 
Wahahaha! Don't worry about it. You'll know soon enough. 
All right, I gotta go. See ya, Ogami. 
Hmm... What on earth were they talking about? 
What's this about a "delivery date," anyway? Man, this is gonna bug me. 
Let me guess, you were talking to her about gossip? 
Something like that, yeah. 
Yuri won't stop pestering me for updates on Tsubaki. 
All right, I gotta go. See ya, Ogami. 
Hmm... What was he talking with her about, anyway? 
Let me guess, something to do with that "secret project"? 
...Maybe, maybe not. 
All right, I gotta go. See ya, Ogami. 
Hmm... What on earth were they talking about? 
He didn't exactly deny it, so maybe it WAS actually about the secret project. 
All right, I gotta go. See ya, Ogami. 
Hmm... What was he talking with her about, anyway? 
Doesn't look like the manager's here. 
Still, I wonder what he was talking about with Tsubaki… 
The steam processor... An incredible machine, one of only a few in all of Japan. 
Yet even it wouldn't know what Orihime's thinking. 
Hmm... Guess no one's here. 
I probably shouldn't stick around here. 
Ooh, smells like soap in here. Must be because Iris just took a bath. 
There's no point in standing idly here. Let's move to another room. 
I thought someone might be taking a bath right now, but I guess not. 
Oh well, I'll just go somewhere else. 
Huh? Looks like someone's in the bathroom. 
There's a large ribbon here... And isn't that Jean-Paul? 
Then that means Iris is the one taking a bath... 
I am drawn to the bath…
Go back outside. 
O-Oh no… My body is moving towards the bathroom on its own... 
(Ah... Iris...) 
Dum de dum... 
Ah, that festival was so much fun! 
I got to see so many stalls with Mon Frère. 
I wish there were festivals every day! 
Say something. 
Quietly leave. 
Hey Iris, how's the water? 
Huh?! 
M-Mon Frère?! What are you doing here?! 
It's just, you looked like you were enjoying yourself, so... 
E... 
EWWWWWWWW! <br> You're such a pervert, Mon Frère!! 
Ow ow ow ow ow... <br> Looks like Iris blasted me out of there with her powers. 
Can't say I didn't deserve it, though. What a mess. 
(She looks like she's enjoying her bath. I shouldn't bother her.) 
(Let's get out of here before she sees me.) 
Phew, looks like she didn't notice. 
She'd never let me live it down if she saw me. 
... 
...Huh? 
M-Mon Frère?! What are you doing here?! 
I, um, sorta just... stumbled in here without realizing it... 
E... 
EWWWWWWWW! <br> You're such a pervert, Mon Frère!! 
Ow ow ow ow ow... <br> Looks like Iris blasted me out of there with her powers. 
Can't say I didn't deserve it, though. What a mess. 
She must be washing off all the sweat from our festival visit. 
I shouldn't interrupt her in the middle of her bath, so I'll just go. 
Right, where to next? 
Ah, that felt great! I should get out now. 
(C-Crap! Gotta get out of here before she sees me!) 
Phew, I think I got away before she realized I was there. 
If I'd been just a moment slower, I might not have made it. That was too close... 
... 
Sorry about earlier, Iris. 
I just kind of stumbled in, and... 
Mon Frère, you do realize I'm a proper lady now, right? 
I really am sorry. I won't do it again. 
I don't wanna fight with you Mon Frère, so I'll forgive you... 
But don't peep on me ever again. 
I can't believe Iris was the one lecturing me this time... 
Well, she seems to be in a better mood now, so I should get going. 
Oh, Mon Frère! Are you here to take a bath? 
N-Nope, just passing through. 
I actually just got out of the bath! 
It was so refreshing! It felt great! 
All right, I'm gonna go now. Bye-bye, Mon Frère! 
Oh yeah! Come study with me again sometime, OK, Mon Frère? 
That big smile of hers... Staying determined really was the right answer all along. 
OK, I should get going myself. 
Looks like no one's taking a bath right now. 
I'll go to a different room. I wonder where everyone else is? 
Hey, Reni. Taking a swim? 
...Diving training. 
I'm recovering robots from the bottom of the pool while avoiding dummy mines. 
Kohran made them for me. 
I see. Sounds pretty fun. 
...Would you like to try, Captain? 
I'll give it a shot! 
I-I'll pass. 
I-I'll pass. Seems pretty dangerous... 
Well, I have places I need to be, so I'll just go now. 
...I see. 
See you later, Reni. Good luck with your training. 
Hmm, what to do... 
It's quite dangerous, so you shouldn't force yourself if you don't want to. 
You're right. There are other things I need to do anyway. 
See you later, Reni. Good luck with your training. 
All right, I'll give it a shot! Time to show you what I learned in the Navy! 
...Show me what you've got, Captain. 
R-Reni... I guess some things never change, huh? 
All right, back in my normal clothes. Training safely completed. 
How was that, Reni? Not bad, huh? 
Indeed, you were quite skilled. Highly efficient, no wasted movements. 
I should try this again sometime. You can make it harder then. 
...Yeah, sure. 
All right, Captain, I should get going. 
OK, good work today. See ya, Reni. 
Before now, I never would've dreamed I could train with Reni like that. 
I haven't swam that hard in ages, made for some great exercise. I'm glad I tried it out. 
All right, back in my normal clothes. Training safely completed. 
How was that, Reni? It wasn't perfect, but not bad, right? 
You made a few unnecessary movements, but if you work on those, you'll become much more efficient. 
Hahaha, as harsh as I expected, Reni. 
I should try this again sometime. I'll do even better then. 
...Yeah, sure. 
All right, Captain, I should get going. 
OK, good work today. See ya, Reni. 
Before now, I never would've dreamed I could train with Reni like that. 
I haven't swam that hard in ages, made for some great exercise. I'm glad I tried it out.  
Phew... I feel a bit better now that I’ve finished changing. 
But man, that was pretty sloppy, huh? 
You made so many wasted movements down there; I'd hardly call that training. 
As harsh as I expected, Reni... 
I should try this again sometime. I'll do even better then. 
...Yeah, sure. 
All right, Captain, I should get going. 
OK, good work today. See ya, Reni. 
I made a fool of myself back there... But still, I'm glad I got to train with Reni. 
Before now, I never would've dreamed I could train with Reni like that.
Hey, Reni. Finished with your diving training? 
Yes. Too much exercise can have the opposite effect than intended. 
OK, I have to go now, sir. 
Yeah, good work today. 
Guess I should get going, too. 
Nobody's swimming in here right now. 
No use sticking around. I'd better go. 
They say fall is also for sports. I could go for some exercise. 
I have things I need to do, though, so maybe next time. 
The door back there leads to the Rose Division's quarters. 
Seriously, though, when the hell did they construct that room? 
Oh, Ensign Ogami, welcome! 
Ichirooo! Welcome! 
Well? Do you feel like giving me a kiss yet? 
Y-Yokihiko! 
Oooh, you're scaring me! Don't glare at me like that, Kiku! 
By the way, Ensign Ogami, I'm told Reni's undertaking some diving training starting at 2:30. 
Perhaps you should head over to the pool if you have free time.
S-Sure. 
Don't ever hesitate to drop on by, Ichiro! 
I... I also... would approve of that. 
OK, Kiku, let's grab him! 
Eep! I-I have to go now, bye!! 
*pant* *pant* <br> I managed to make it out somehow... 
I swear, I'm putting my life on the line every time I step into that room. 
Ah... O-Ogami! 
You came back! I'm so happy!! 
OK, everyone! This time we'll grab him for sure! 
Wahhhh!! I-I REALLY have to go now, bye!! 
*pant* *gasp* <br> Finally made it out of there... 
Seriously, why do I keep going into that room? 
That battle last month was quite the ordeal. 
I never imagined I'd have to fight against Reni in her Eisenkleid. 
3 o'clock already, huh? 
I can't just keep ignoring Orihime. 
OK, I'll head to her room and have a talk with her. 
Sorry, Ogami. I can only sell you one bromide per month. 
I see. That's too bad. 
So sorry, Mr. Ogami, but each customer is only allowed to purchase one bromide at a time.
Oh, really? That's too bad.

Ayame and I almost never lived in the same household, even though we were sisters. 
Eh...? 
It's not so unusual, given our lineage. We have less a "family tree" and more a "family wisteria." 
Yet, I still knew that she was the type of person that would sacrifice her own well-being for others... 
Carrying everyone's burdens by herself... 
That's why, when I received the news that she had passed away, I made up my mind. 
I want to carry on her will. I want to protect the capital, just like she did. 
And for my own sake, too. 
...I suppose that's all I have to say. 
You know, Ogami, I came here to work of my own volition. 
To protect the peace of this city, and to cherish our audience's smiles. 
I'm sure you feel the same, Ogami. 
Yes, of course. 
So let's both do our best. 
For my sister... <br> For everyone... 
Yes ma'am! 
Well, today I will tell you about the Anti-Kouma Corps. 
The Anti-Kouma Corps was the Army's predecessor to the Imperial Assault Troupe. 
Ikki Yoneda, Kazuma Shinguji, Shinnosuke Yamazaki, and... Ayame Fujieda. 
A special unit, comprising only those four, formed to defend the capital from evil. 
Seven years ago... A Kouma appeared in Nihonbashi. 
Even though it was just a single Kouma, the military and police were powerless against it. 
However, the Anti-Kouma Corps managed to seal the Kouma away, albeit at great cost. 
That incident made the government painfully aware of the need to defend against such evil. 
As a result, the Imperial Assault Troupe as you know it was born. 
The troupe is the fruit of the Anti-Kouma Corps' will. 
And, of the four members, only General Yoneda is still alive today. 
For the sake of those four, who protected the people from evil... We have to keep fighting. 
... 
Now then, today I'll tell you about Ayame's travels. 
In order to recruit members for the Flower Division, Ayame traveled around the world. 
She searched for suitable Flower Division candidates, girls with powerful spiritual abilities.
She sent me letters from various countries. America, France, China... 
Whenever she did, I must be honest, I envied her. 
I see, so she did all that... 
Those same candidates make up the Flower Division we have now. 
And you know what, Ogami? Recently, I've been thinking... 
The people Ayame chose truly were the best people for the job. That includes you. 
Kaede... 
Ayame entrusted the Flower Division to me, so I'll continue to give it my all. 
Don't give up. Even in the hardest of times, remember to never give up, Ogami. 
Yes ma'am! I will do all I can to meet your expectations! 
Now then, today I'll tell you about Ayame and Major Yamazaki. 
Both Ayame and Major Yamazaki were members of the troupe's predecessor, the Anti-Kouma Corps.
Major Yamazaki was a brilliant scientist who created the foundational designs for Spirit Armor... 
And they say he had a stronger sense of justice than most. 
Anyone could see that Ayame and Major Yamazaki were deeply in love with each other... 
But their relationship crumbled when the Kouma War started. 
What could have possibly caused that? 
Now, this is pure conjecture... 
But it seems that during their battles, Major Yamazaki became obsessed with certain questions.
“What are these demons?" "Why do they exist?" 
And "how are they so powerful?" 
General Yoneda noticed that Major Yamazaki had changed, and he warned him many times. 
But, in the end, no one could change his mind. 
Not even Ayame... 
When the Kouma War ended seven years ago, Major Yamazaki went missing. 
And then in our recent battles, he appeared again as Cerulean Satan. 
Justice by power... <br> Rule through evil... 
Perhaps that was his conclusion... 
Back when he appeared in front of the theater six months ago... 
I wonder what Cerulean Satan... No, what Major Yamazaki was trying to tell us... 
...
