Let's return to the Imperial Theater, Ogami. 
Wait... Wait. 
...! 
Hahaha. I am unable to live as a human being, and yet unable to die. 
I once fought you under the name Cerulean Satan and lost this body. 
Listen well. The hatred you feel towards evil will only grow stronger... 
... until the evil within you awakens as well. 
Yamazaki... 
Yamazaki!? 
Heh. It's been a while, Yoneda. 
I didn't want to see you in the state I am now. 
Yamazaki! 
How many times did I tell you not to trust in power alone?! 
Isn't the justice you all hold so dear nothing more than power, in the end? 
In this world, there is no justice to be had without absolute power! 
That's not true, Yamazaki! 
No! Humans don't deserve to be protected. 
You do not know the sorrows of this city! 
Nor the capital's ancient, accumulated grudge! 
My soul... is beginning to wane. 
But remember, the curse of this city will continue. 
It is cursed! Cursed! Hahahahahahahaha! 
Demon King, was it? Just who is he? 
Mon Frère, I'm scared... 
That clown in the carnival mask had such bloodlust. 
That man smells of death and destruction. 
Is he our new enemy? 
I don't know... 
He said something about the city being cursed. What did he mean by that? 
I don't think there is any point in wondering over something you do not know. 
Just be happy that we won. 
You're right. Now, why don't we go home to our theater? 
All right, everyone. Let's head back to the theater! 
Mission complete! The Imperial Assault Troupe, Flower Division, all mechs returning! 
Come on! Drink up, Ogami, drink up! 
Hahahaha. Kind of a bittersweet occasion to drink. Ahaha... 
Mr. Yoneda, let's drink a lot today! 
Oh, by the way, Orihime, didn't you say you were leaving after the battle? 
Yes, that was the plan, but it seems that you would all be in some trouble without my help. 
So I thought, well, I can stay here for a bit longer. 
Ah, thank you, Orihime! 
That's great, Ogami. Orihime will stay with the Flower Division! 
You know what, we should redo the welcome party today. 
Yes. Once again, Orihime, we look forward to working with you. 
Just so you know, my distaste for Japanese men will not be changing. 
Oh, Ok... 
It's all right, because I love you sooo much! 
Hahaha, thank you Iris. 
By the way, Mr. Yoneda, who's the enemy this time? 
I haven't a clue. But, one thing's for sure: no matter what sort of bastard we're dealing with... 
We must protect the sanctity of the capital and the lives of its people. 
...Yes, sir! 
All right, drink and be merry! We're going to have a good time today, so let's party! 
It's a new beginning for the Flower Division! 
And we're celebrating Ogami's return to doing all sorts of odd-jobs! You'll be working hard tomorrow! 
What?! No way! 
Ahahahahahaha...
