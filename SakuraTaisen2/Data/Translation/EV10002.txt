Nrrrgh… <br> Those new Spirit Armors… <br> Such power…
But still… <br> There were only two of you… How could I lose…?
Someone like you could never hope to understand.
No matter how far apart we may be, our hearts are as one! We're always fighting together!
Imperial Assault Troupe… You've ruined all my… careful planning…
This defeat wasn't part of my calculatioooooooons!!
There's one thing your calculations could never account for: the human heart.
Let's hurry, Ogami. Everybody must be worried.
Yeah, got it. <br> Let's go, Sakura!
