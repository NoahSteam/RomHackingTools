Ogami! The invading hostiles are targeting the Mikasa's engines.
The engine unit is split into seven sections. We can still fly so long as one of them is still intact…
But if they all get destroyed, the Mikasa will lose power and fall out of the sky.
I leave the defense of the engines to you, Ogami!
Got it, Kaede, ma'am!
