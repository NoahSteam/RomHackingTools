Wh-Why… <br> Why can I never win against such… filth?!
Remember this, trash! <br> I'll make you all burn, burn! I'll burn you to cinders!!
The Assault Troupe… <br> This capital… <br> I'll burn every last piece of garbage!!
Heheh! <br> How do ya like that!
Looks like he got away. <br> But I'm just thankful there were no civilian casualties.
We were in a tight spot there. You really saved our necks, Maria.
Apologies for being so late, Captain.
Welcome back, Maria.
I'm glad to see you're all doing well. So… How's the manager holding up?
Yoneda's doing great! Sounded like he wants to hold a party in his hospital room…
I know! We'll throw a party back at home, too! My "Mr. Party Royale" will really liven the place up!
Same Kohran as always. <br> Aren't you forgetting something important, though?
…Ahhh, right! <br> We gotta do our usual thing.
Yeah, and we've got the whole troupe together now. <br> …All right, let's do it!
OK, here we go! <br> All together…
Victory pose, yeah!!
