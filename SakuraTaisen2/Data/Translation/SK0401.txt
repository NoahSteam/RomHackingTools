Phew… Man, it sure is hot. Even just visiting the manager at the hospital is a real struggle. 
We’re truly in the throes of summer now, aren’t we?
On the other hand, Sakura, you seem to be doing just fine in this heat.
Hehe. It’s thanks to my summer dress. How do you think it looks on me, Ogami? 
It suits you. 
I like your usual outfit.
It suits you well. It's a nice change of pace from your usual clothing. 
Thank you very much. I'm… glad you like it, Ogami. 
Thank goodness. I’m happy I decided to try out this outfit.
Hmm… I like your usual outfit a bit more.
Japanese-style clothes suit you better, in my opinion. 
Is that so… What a shame… And just when I had gotten a chance to try it on.
S-Sorry, I don't really know much about women's clothing. 
Ah, I apologize… <br> I didn’t mean to put you on the spot like that, Ogami. 
Although, honestly, I had a feeling you would say something like that. Hehe. 
A-Anyway, how about we go inside the hospital now.
Arf, arf! 
…Oh? 
Arf! 
Aw, what a cute puppy. There, there. 
I don’t see a collar on him. Must be a stray. 
Arf! 
Ah, he ran away. 
He really was a cute pup. I wish we could bring him back to the theater with us… 
Ah!! 
(Oh, no! That car's not slowing down!) 
Kyaah, the puppy!! 
Ugh! 
I gotta jump and save him! 
Damn it, I have to make it! 
Ogami!! 
S-Sakura! Wh-What should we do!? 
O-Ogami, please calm down! 
Oh no, the car! Kyaaah!!
Damn it! There's no other option, I gotta save him!! 
Ogamiii!! 
Ogamiii!! 
Uwaaaaah! 
Ooffff! 
Yiiiippp! 
Ogami!! 
Are you and the puppy all right, Ogami?! 
W-We're OK. Sort of… 
I leapt out into the road without thinking, but… it seems like that was the right call. 
Ow, I think I sprained my leg… I jumped at an awkward angle. 
Oof… 
Hahaha, I hope you're thankful for the rescue, little guy.
Thank goodness, neither of you are hurt too bad. 
You there!
What the hell do you think you’re doing, leaping in front of our car like that?! 
What would you have done if we had gotten hurt? You better think carefully before you answer! 
I had to… You would have run over this dog at the speed you were driving. 
What was that? You mean to tell me that the life of that mutt is more important than our own?! 
Would you stop this! Your attitude is uncalled for! 
You bastards… How dare you talk like that in front of Imperial soldiers. 
That rank insignia… Are you a commissioned officer in the Army? 
Oh… So you’re military, too, are you? State your name and rank. 
Ensign Ichiro Ogami! 
Like hell I'm telling you! 
I am Imperial Navy Ensign, Ichiro Ogami! 
Aha… Ichiro Ogami, huh? I've heard your name before. 
You're the captain of that rotten unit overrun by women. The Imperial Assault Troupe. 
What did you just say!? 
Like hell I'm telling you!
What was that, you bastard?! 
Wait… I recognize your face. 
You're Ichiro Ogami, the captain of that rotten unit overrun by women. The Imperial Assault Troupe. 
… 
… 
Answer his question, bastard!! 
Wait… I recognize your face. 
You're Ichiro Ogami, the captain of that rotten unit overrun by women. The Imperial Assault Troupe. 
… 
Look at you, cavorting with young girls in broad daylight.
And on top of that, you dare to block our way?! Disgraceful!!
For all you've done, you deserve corporal punishment! Vermin like you are ruining Japan.
W-What!? What are you going to do to Ogami!? 
Grit your teeth, "Captain." 
Resist. 
I haven't done anything wrong. Hit me and I'll hit you back! 
Oho… If you make a big scene, this will become an even larger issue between the Army and Navy. 
(Damn, he’s right. Causing an incident while Yoneda is still away would just make things worse for us.) 
Finally made your decision? Good, now take this! 
Ogami! I've got your back!! 
Wait, Sakura! If this escalates any further, it will cause an incident between the Army and Navy.
Commander Yoneda is still absent, too. It'll just make things even worse for us. 
Ogami… 
Heh, what a complete idiot! Now, take this!! 
… 
Insolent cur! Salute His Excellency! This is Keigo Kyogoku, Minister of the Army! 
Keigo… Kyougoku? 
So you're Ensign Ichiro Ogami. 
You got yourself a pair of nice piercing eyes. 
… 
And you… You resemble your father quite a bit, Sakura Shinguji. 
Huh!? So you… You knew my father? 
Indeed… <br> What a pathetic man he was. 
I’m sure even now he is lamenting his foolish, pointless sacrifice in the afterlife… 
What!? 
Hold it, Sakura! 
Try not to die a dog’s death like your father.
Please, make wiser decisions while you still live, Sakura Shinguji. 
H-How can you say that!? 
Excuse us for now. 
Stop right there!! 
Sakura! 
Unforgivable… <br> How dare he mock my father… I absolutely will not let that stand!! 
Sakura… 
Ogami, are you hurt? 
I'm fine, it's not a big deal. 
But that bruise… 
Oh, this? That's from when I rescued the puppy. It's not a big deal. 
Ogami… 
You stopped that fight from escalating any further… That was very admirable of you.
Hahaha, thanks. 
Sakura, let's keep what just happened earlier a secret and not tell the manager. 
Huh? B-But… 
I don’t want to cause him any undue stress while he’s still hospitalized. 
Ogami… 
Let's go inside the manager's room. 
Our apologies, Commander. None of this would have happened if we had been more careful. 
…Hm? <br> I hear people talking… <br> Sounds like someone’s in the manager’s room.
Don’t give it a second thought. I never would’ve dreamed of getting shot in a place like that. 
Guess I was just too stubborn to die. Wahahahaha! 
Now, get back to your job. No need to dwell on the matter. 
Understood. I shall return to my duties. Please, excuse me for now. 
Damn it… How could I have let this happen under my watch…
Kayama, is that you? 
Nwhahhh?! O-Ogami!? 
H-Hey Ogami! Ah, how lovely the sea is. When it comes to summer, the beach is the place to be! 
Yes, it sure is lovely.
What were you discussing?
Yes, it sure is lovely. 
What were you discussing?
…This is a hospital.
The beach in the summertime, huh? <br> That sure does sound lovely.
R-Right, Ogami! Swimming in the ocean is the ideal summer hot spot! 
Ah, what a joy it is to have a friend that understands me so well.
What were you discussing with the manager?
W-Wha… We were just talking about work. 
…Work? Come to think of it, what kind of work do you do exactly?
O-Oh, come on now. Don't worry yourself over every little detail. 
…We’re not at the beach, Kayama. This is a hospital. 
Urk… 
Th-The hospital is great, too! My heart is filled with joy when I breathe in the smell of disinfectants. 
Wh-What's with you… 
What’s wrong, Ogami? Do you not share my sentiment? 
How am I supposed to respond when you start talking about the sea out of nowhere? 
Hahaha, you’re hopeless. Some Navy ensign you are! 
W-Well then, I must be going. 
Tell Yoneda to get well soon. Remember, “To err is human, to forgive keeps the doctor away.” Farewell!
Isn’t an apple a day supposed to keep the doctor away? 
You said his name was Kayama, right? He’s an interesting character. 
Well, he’s a character, that’s for sure.
All right then, shall we head inside?
Oh, you two. 
Good afternoon, Mr. Yoneda. 
How are you feeling today, sir? 
Heh, as I keep saying, these wounds are nothing to worry about.
But that blasted doctor keeps saying I need to stay in bed and rest.
Then… Has there been any news about when you'll be discharged? 
Ah… I may be able to leave next month. 
I see. In any case, please take care of yourself. 
By the way, Ogami… What's with the bruises? You get into a fight? 
Ah, t-this is… I just tripped and fell over while we were walking here. 
Uh-huh… <br> Now that's suspicious. <br> Did you get caught two-timing, Chief? 
Huh!? 
Yoohoo!! <br> Long time no see. <br> How’ve you all been?  
Kohran!! 
Oh, Kohran! <br> Didn’t you have work to do at the Hanayashiki Branch?
My job there's finally done and dusted. Now I can return to the theater.
So, I figured I oughta visit Yoneda on my way back. 
Heh, I told you all I’m perfectly fine but you keep coming anyway.
But, Chief, are you sure nothing happened to you? Your handsome face is all messed up. 
… 
… 
…Sorry, Ogami, but I can't stay silent any more. 
Sakura! 
Excuse me… Mr. Yoneda. <br> Do you know the Minister of the Army, a man named Keigo Kyogoku? 
…Yeah, I know 'em all right. Did something happen? 
Yes… We actually had a quarrel with his subordinates earlier. 
Ogami didn't want the scuffle to get worse, so he stayed silent and let them punch him. 
… 
I see, so that's what happened. 
Keigo Kyogoku is a man who reached the position of Minister of the Army at a young age. 
He advocates for a more militaristic government despite the public calling for disarmament. 
This ideology and his strong personality has led to him gaining support from young like-minded officers. 
Well, sounds like you held your own out there, Ogami. Very impressive.
As they say, “The wealthy do not fight”… Oh wait, we don't have money, do we? Hahaha-- Ow, ow, ow.
But that man spoke ill of my father! I can’t just let that go…
So, he said something about Kazuma, too. 
Well, endure it for now. <br> We can't afford to get provoked by their taunting. Got it? 
But… 
Oops, it's time for the doctor to check up on me. 
Both of you really went through a lot just to visit me today, eh? 
N-No, it was no problem at all.
I’m fine, so head on home already. I can’t even enjoy a bit of sake with you all watching over me. 
Don't go overboard, Yoneda. You’re still an injured man after all. Well, see ya next time!
Excuse us then, sir. 
Sure… Oh, wait a minute. Ogami, you stick around for a bit. We need to talk.
Y-Yes, sir. 
… 
What did you want to discuss with me, Mr. Yoneda?
The thing is… I want you to hold onto something for me.
T-This is… 
It's my sword that's been with me through thick and thin since the Kouma War… The Divine Blade Mekkyaku.
Something so important…
I will take care of it. 
I can’t accept this.
…Why me?
Understood… I will accept the Divine Blade Mekkyaku and keep it in my care.
Hm… I'm counting on you, Ogami. 
I… I can’t accept this. For a warrior, a sword is equal to its wielder's life…
It feels like you're giving me a memento to remember you by…
Wha, a memento? You idiot! I’m not dead yet!
I'm just asking you to hold on to this for me. Now quit your grumbling and take it!! 
Y-Yes, sir. Understood. <br> I will take care of it.
…Why me? Why leave such an important sword in my hands?
You're right, it is important. That's precisely why I'm entrusting it to someone I can count on.
Y-Yes. I understand. Then I will accept the Mekkyaku. 
… 
What? You don't want it, Ogami? 
General Yoneda, is there any reason why you're entrusting this priceless item to me? 
Eh, I just feel like it. I’ll be more at ease knowing it’s with you instead of at the hospital.
Y-Yes, sir… Understood. <br> I will take care of it. 
…Mm. All right, off you go. Head on back with the others, Ogami.
Roger! Well, I hope you take good care of yourself, sir. 
Will do! Take care of the gang at the theater while I’m gone!
Yes, sir! Please excuse me. 
We've been waiting for you, Chief! What was your business with Yoneda? 
Huh, you’re holding a sword. Where did that come from? 
Well, it’s… a long story. Ah, anyway, thank you for waiting. 
Arf! 
Oh, it's you! 
Aaah… What a cute pup! Is it yours, Chief?
Actually… He appears to be a stray.
I rescued him earlier today from almost getting hit by a car.
He must have been waiting here this whole time just to see you.
Arf! 
Aw, looks like the little guy isn’t going to leave your side anytime soon, Chief.
I know, Ogami! What if we kept the puppy at the theater with us?
Good idea, let's keep him! 
That’s out of the question.
I'm more of a cat person. 
That’s a great idea, let’s do it! You must have been lonely out here. Why don't you come home with us? 
Arf, arf! Woof! 
Ooh, that's a good boy. 
Thank you so much, Ogami! 
You’re a big softy, Chief.
Alrighty everyone, we're heading home! Off to the theater we go!
Arf, arf! 
That’s out of the question. Keeping a pet is a lot more responsibility than you think. 
But I’m sure everyone would share that responsibility. Please, Ogami?
Right, we'll all pitch in to take care of him! Please, Chief? 
Uhm… Well… <br> OK, if you insist. 
Hurraaaay! <br> It's a deal, then! 
Isn't that great, boy? Let's go home together! 
Arf, arf! 
I’d rather have a kitten. I’m more of a cat person, myself.
Don’t say that, Ogami! <br> Come on, please? 
She’s got a point, Chief. You can’t just leave him here like this.
I'll make sure to take care of him along with Sakura. So can we keep him, please? 
Well… OK. If you insist. 
Hurraaaay! <br> It's a deal, then! 
Isn't that great, boy? Let's go home together! 
Arf, arf! 
… 
We'll make sure to look after him. Please, Ogami? 
Right, we'll take care of him. Don't worry, you can leave it all to us! 
Uhm… Well… <br> OK, if you insist. 
Hurraaaay! <br> It's a deal, then! 
Isn't that great, boy? Let's go home together! 
Arf, arf! 
Tell me some gossip. 
I'll come back later. 
Seems like you’ve started keeping a dog in the courtyard, Ogami. 
That’s right. Sorry I made the decision without consulting you two first. 
Oh, it's no problem!<br>The dog's name is
<br>from what I heard, right?
You got that information pretty quick. Just like always, Yuri. 
Heheh. Actually, Kohran just dropped by to tell us the news. She was really excited to talk about it. 
I see, glad to hear it. I hope that you two will play with 
every now and then.
Has Mr. Yoneda been doing OK? 
Yeah, we just visited him in the hospital and he was as lively as ever. 
He's not allowed to drink there, so it’s a good opportunity for his body to recover a bit.
Well, this is the manager we're talking about. He's probably been sneaking some alcohol on the sly.
I heard from Kanna recently that some food in the kitchen's gone missing. 
Huh?! D-Don't tell me there are rats? 
I don't think so. The food disappears along with the packaging. 
Perhaps, unbeknownst to us, there is a person secretly living in the theater… 
…Just kidding. Did I make your heart skip a beat? 
Ogami, have you ever been to Café Paulista? 
Um, Cafe… what now? No, I haven't. 
It’s a place that serves delicious coffee and donuts.
The cafe is wonderful, but all of the customers seem to be a bunch of writer types.
Whenever I go, I always end up having some kind of high-minded conversation… It gets tiring sometimes. 
By the way, I've heard that there are quite a few female bus conductors these days!
Women that work alongside men are pretty cool, don't you think?
I kind of admire them.
Ah, now that I think about it, Ogami, you’re a man working among mostly women, aren’t you? 
By the way, Maria is scheduled to return from America soon. 
Huh, is that so? It will be a huge relief to have her back.
You look happy to hear that, Ogami. Were you lonely without Maria? 
I-It's not like that. I’m just happy to have another member return to the Flower Division.
It’s hard keeping an eye on everyone all by myself.
I see. I’m sure it must be difficult to keep the team together on your own.
That reminds me. People have apparently seen a mysterious figure in the theater holding a guitar.
Sometimes, they even hear the sounds of a guitar playing alongside someone singing.
From what I understand, they don’t appear to be from the theater's orchestra.
If I ever find out who it is, you’ll be the first to know.
O-OK… Thanks. 
Speaking of which, summer break is coming up next month. 
I'm thinking of buying the latest swimsuit and going to the beach! How about we go together, Kasumi? 
Um… I think I'll pass… By the way, do you have any plans for summer break, Ogami? 
Hmm… In this line of work, we don’t really get days off. Who knows if we’ll get a vacation this summer…
Sorry, Ogami, but I'm all out of gossip for now. 
I'll have some more interesting tidbits to share another time, so look forward to it!
Oh… Ogami, I see you bought Maria's bromide.
I thought I should at least get her bromide since she’s off in America right now. 
Would you like me to give you her call number, Ogami? 
…Really? 
She actually gave me her number in case of emergencies. 
You can talk to her if you dial "13900." 
13900, OK. Thanks, Yuri! 
I'll come back another time. Good luck with your work. 
OK. Thanks for coming, Ogami. 
Tell us if you hear any juicy stories! 
Sorry Ogami, but customers are only allowed to purchase one of each bromide. 
I see. That's too bad. 
So sorry, Mr. Ogami, but customers are only allowed to purchase one of each bromide.
Oh, really? That's too bad.
