Phew… <br> We're pretty much done cleaning the gift shop. 
Thanks a lot, Ogami! 
Thank you for your hard work, Ogami. Having you here was a big help. 
Now that both our office and the gift shop are clean… We can vacation without any worries!
That’s right. The theater is taking a summer break starting tomorrow. And that means… 
I’ll be freed from performing my usual odd jobs for a while.
Heheh, good for you, Ogami. Now you can relax for a bit.
U-Uhm, by the way, Ogami. Starting next month, I’ll be away from the theater on assignment. 
In the meantime, a new girl will be taking care of the gift shop. Please, make her feel welcome.
Huh? What assignment?
U-Uh, that's… 
Sorry, Ogami. Her mission is top-secret, so neither of us have been told anything either.
Yup. Even with my vast information network, I haven’t learned a single detail. What could it be? 
Eheh! Truth be told, I haven't been given any specifics yet. 
I-I see. <br> Now I'm really curious. 
Yoooo! <br> I’m hooooome!
Huh? <br> That voice, could it be… 
Yo, Ogami! Kasumi! Yuri! Tsubaki! It's been a while. 
M-Mr. Yoneda! 
Welcome back, sir!!
Have you made a full recovery?
Yup, I'm fit as a fiddle now. Sorry to have made you guys worry. 
Hooray! This is big news! <br> I gotta tell everyone right away! 
Hahaha, Yuri hasn’t changed a bit. You know what they say, there’s no place like home! 
Now that I’m back, let’s party! Gather everyone up and let’s kick things off with a bang! 
(Oh boy… Looks like he's gonna throw a huge bash.) 
Thanks, you guys. <br> This was a wonderful hospital-leaving party. 
Oh no, if we had more time we could have prepared an even better celebration. 
Yeah, you should have told us you were coming sooner. 
She’s right, Mr. Yoneda. This was very sudden. 
Heheh, I didn’t want you to go out of your way for me. 
By the way, you look great in that outfit, Maria. 
Hey, Ogami. <br> Wouldn't you agree? 
It really makes you shine.
You look pretty cool. 
You're beautiful, Maria. 
The outfit really makes you shine, Maria. 
Is… Is that so? <br> Thank you very much, Captain. 
Wahahaha! <br> You’re quite the smooth talker, Ogami.
You look pretty cool, Maria. 
Hmhm, is that so? <br> Thank you very much. 
Oh, come on, Ogami. <br> You’re talking to a lady, you know? 
I’m sure you could have thought of something more flattering to say… <br> Jeez, you can be so dense. 
It's fine, Manager. The captain was just expressing his honest thoughts.
Knowing he gave a genuine compliment is more than enough for me. 
Maria… You're beautiful. The sight of you takes my breath away.
Ca-Captain! <br> Please, not in front of everyone else… 
Quite the smooth talker, aren't you, Ogami?
I can’t believe you would say something so tacky.
Gahahahaha! Good, good. <br> Now this is the Flower Division I know and love. 
I uh… Well… <br> How do I put it into words? 
Mr. Yoneda! <br> Look, you’ve made the captain all flustered with your strange questions. 
Wahaha! Sorry, Maria. <br> I didn't mean to tease you two that much. 
But I kinda expected Ogami would get tongue tied. 
R-Right… 
But really, you guys were a huge help. You did a great job taking care of the place while I was away.
Let me say it again, I truly thank each and every one of you. 
It was no problem, Mr. Yoneda. After all, the Flower Division always helps out one of their own.
Yeah, yeah. <br> You're one of us, Commander. 
Hehe… Aw, come on. <br> You guys are too kind. 
Well, after all that’s happened, allow me to reward your hard work with a token of my appreciation.
…Reward?
That’s right. Starting tomorrow, the theater is on summer break. 
Everyone needs a chance to relax every once in a while. So, all of you are going on a trip. 
Huh!? A trip? 
Yep. In fact, I've already made arrangements for your lodging. 
You’ll be staying four days and three nights at a resort in Atami, starting tomorrow. 
Even I've heard of Atami! It’s a city famous for its hot springs! 
Ogami. I want you to relax and have a good time with everyone in the Flower Division. 
Thank you, sir! 
You’re not going?
Will the theater be OK? 
Thank you very much! <br> We'll make sure to enjoy ourselves to the fullest! 
Mm. 
…Oh right, I believe that Saki wanted to go as well. So make sure to take her with you. 
The manager and I will be staying here, so take it easy. 
But don't forget to bring your Kinematron, Ogami. 
If anything happens, make sure to contact us right away. We'll send the Soaring Whale. 
Roger. In that case, we'll gladly take your offer. 
You’re not going, sir? <br> Not even Kaede? 
Work has really piled up while I’ve been out of the office. You all go have fun without us. 
Oh right, it seems that Saki wants to go, too. <br> Take her with you. 
Every once in a while, you should kick back without us around. 
But don't forget to bring your Kinematron, Ogami. 
If anything happens, make sure to contact us right away. We'll send the Soaring Whale.
Is that so? Then we'll gladly take your offer. 
While we're gone, will the theater be OK? What if the Black Demon Society shows up somewhere? 
Don't worry about it. I've already thought all that through.
The manager and I will be staying here, so take it easy. 
But don't forget to bring your Kinematron, Ogami. 
If anything happens, make sure to contact us right away. We'll send the Soaring Whale.
Is that so? Then we'll gladly take your offer. 
Uh… What should I do… 
No need to worry about the theater, Ogami. 
The manager and I will be staying here, so take it easy. 
But don't forget to bring your Kinematron, Ogami. 
If anything happens, make sure to contact us right away. We'll send the Soaring Whale. 
Is that so? Then we'll gladly take your offer. 
Traveling to a hot spring resort for a summer getaway… That doesn't sound too bad at all.
Yeah, it sounds fun. <br> Ooh, I'm so excited! 
Yaaay, yaaay!! <br> We're going on a trip! <br> A trip! 
This will be my first time vacationing in Japan. 
I've never gone to Atami before. I can’t wait! 
A break is necessary at times… 
Alllll right! <br> We're gonna eat and play to our heart's content! 
What a wonderful gift we’ve been given, Captain.
Yeah. Looks like we're in for a fun summer vacation. 
Now then, today’s the day we finally leave for our trip.
The plan is for us to depart from the entrance hall at 10… So, I still have an hour to spare. 
Guess I’ll go and see how everyone else is doing.
Ah, if it isn't the chief. Hello and good morning.
Good morning, Kohran. Are you done preparing for the trip? 
Yup, all set and ready to go. Right now, I’m heading over to the hangar for a bit.
Looks like everyone else is still in their rooms. 
I see. They may still be packing their things for the trip.
Well, off I go. <br> See ya later, Chief.
I guess I should get going, too.
No one's here yet. Seems that I arrived too early. 
Everyone will be gathering here at 10 o'clock. I should kill some more time and come back later. 
Oh, it's Reni. Hey! 
Good morning, Reni. 
…Morning. 
Arf, arf! 
<sp>looks like he<br>wants to play with you again today.
In fact, he seems to have grown even more attached to you, Reni.
Arf! 
… 
Reni… 
Gotten used to him yet? 
Let me join in.
Try petting his head.
Have you gotten used to him yet? 
…Used to what? 
, of course.<br>You’re not good with dogs, right? 
…That’s inaccurate. <br> I'm just not interested.
Can I play with him, too? Let me join in.
… 
<sp>wants to play with<br>both of us. Don'tcha boy?
Arf! 
You hear that, Reni? <br> He just said yes.
…He was only reacting to the sound of a human’s voice, not to your question specifically.
R-Reni… 
Try petting his head. <br> Here, like this…
Wooofff… 
See? He loves it. 
… 
Arf, arf! 
Give it a try, Reni.
… 
… 
Ah, wait!
Aw… <br> Reni just got up and left.
Arf, arf, arf! 
Ah,<sp> 
… 
Hahaha, he's chasing after Reni. 
…He sure has taken a liking to Reni. 
Wooofff… 
…<br>Couldn’t catch up to Reni,<br>eh, boy?
Don’t worry. I don’t think Reni dislikes you.
Woof. 
Oh, isn't that Kohran over there? 
Heeey, Kohran! 
That voice… <br> Is that you, Chief? 
Man, it’s still the morning but it’s already a scorcher. Summer days are here again, eh? 
I’ve been harvesting my tomatoes here in the courtyard and I've already worked up a sweat. 
I know, mind if I ask for your help picking these bad boys?
Yeah, no problem! 
I'm busy right now. 
Yeah, no problem. <br> I'd be glad to help. 
Really? Thanks, Chief! 
I'd like to, but I'm busy right now. 
Aw… That's too bad. But if you’re busy, then it can’t be helped. 
I'll see you in the entrance hall, then. 
Hmmm, what should I do? 
You got nothing else going on, right? What do ya say, Chief? 
…OK then. I'll help out. 
Thanks, Chief! <br> I knew you’d say yes! 
To tell the truth, picking the tomatoes isn’t the hard part…
Dealing with those guys is the real challenge…
Are those… crows? 
You betcha. They’ve been flying around eyeing my tomatoes.
Lately, the crows have been gobbling up the veggies in the courtyard.
But I’m not gonna let them have even one bite of these tomatoes! 
That's where you come in, Chief. I need you to drive them away with these smoke bombs I made. 
B-But… <br> Won’t that hurt the crows? 
No worries. My smoke bombs will just make them dizzy for a bit, it won't harm them. 
I’m counting on you, Chief! The fate of these tomatoes rests in your hands! 
I managed to pick all the tomatoes safely. Thanks a lot, Chief! 
The crows are doing fine, too. All's well that ends well! 
I managed to pick the tomatoes. Thanks, Chief! 
Sadly, a few of them got eaten by the crows. Oh well, you win some, you lose some.
The poor tomatoes… They didn’t stand a chance against those crows. 
Sorry, Kohran… If only I could have aimed better. 
Nah, it's fine. You just did your best, Chief. 
The crows may have won this battle but we’ll get ‘em next time!
Kohran… 
By the way, I didn't even know that you were growing tomatoes out here. 
Hehe. I'm always researching machines so I decided to give researching vegetables a try. 
If you're gonna grow veggies, you might as well make sure they're tasty, am I right? 
Haha… <br> Well, I suppose you got a point. 
Ah, look at the time! <br> I better get going. 
I'm really grateful for your help. Later, Chief! 
It’s just like Kohran to use smoke bombs, of all things, to drive away crows. 
Well, I better get going too.
Oh, hey Chief. I just finished harvesting the tomatoes. 
Some of them got eaten by crows, but I still managed to pick a few. 
I see. That's great. 
Yup. Now I can go on the trip without having to worry about them.
Well then, see ya later, Chief. 
Seems that she managed to save some of the tomatoes. That’s a relief. 
Now then, maybe I should go somewhere else. 
Arf, arf! 
, we're gonna go <br> on a trip for a while. 
Take care of the theater while we're gone, OK? 
Arf! 
Yo, Boss! C'mere, c'mere! 
Perfect timing, I was just sittin’ down for some breakfast. 
Whaddaya say, Boss? Up for round 2 of our eatin’ competition?
Oh, nice idea. So, what are we eating? 
It’s an Okinawan favorite called “mimiga.” It's a pork dish.
The rules are just like last time: the first to finish their 3-course meal wins. 
I'm gonna win this time, Kanna! 
Well, let's do this! Ready, aaaand, begin! 
OK, what should I grab first? 
Mimiga 
Rice 
Barley tea 
This pork… It's kind of weird looking. 
Hehe… That's ‘cause mimiga is actually made from pig's ears. 
It has a crunchy texture and it tastes great. Give it a try. 
Munch, munch, crunch… Mm-hm! It’s delicious! 
Oh, the rice is cooked perfectly. Munch, munch…
Summer’s just begun, so I’ll have a refreshing cup of barley tea. 
Gulp, gulp… <br> OK, I finished the tea! 
Which one should I grab first? I'm not sure… 
What're you doin’, Boss? I'm gonna beat ya to the finish if you don't start chowin' down. 
OK, I finished the first dish. What do you think of that, Kanna? 
Hey, not bad, Boss. Seems you've improved since last month, huh? 
All right… Time to get serious. 
I'm not gonna lose! OK, now here comes the second dish! 
Mimiga… 
Rice… 
Barley tea… 
Never thought I would eat pig ears so early in the morning… 
Whew, I managed to finish eating just about everything on the plate! 
Eating two bowls of rice in the morning is quite… tough. 
Munch… Munch… <br> OK, I managed to finish it. 
Gulp… Gulp… 
Phew, I can slow down a bit thanks to this tea. 
Is it just me… or am I not able to move my chopsticks anymore?
What's wrong? You ‘bout to give up, Boss? 
Phew, I finally managed to finish the second dish… 
Way to go, Boss! I can't afford to be careless now! 
OK. Now, time to finish the third batch… I can do this! 
Mi… miga… 
Ri… Rice… 
Barley… tea… 
Mi… miga… <br> Four pieces to go… 
Munch, munch… <br> Three pieces… 
Chomp, chomp… <br> Two pieces… 
Crunch, crunch… <br> One… 
Th-There! I finished all the mimiga! 
After all this food, even the sight of rice is starting to make me sick…
Anyway… One bowl to go… I'm finishing this. 
Munch… Gobble… Urk… 
All riiight! I finished all of the rice! 
Glug… Glug… Glug! 
Hey, hey, don't just chug it all down in one go! 
Pwaaah! O-OK… I finished drinking the tea! 
Huft… Huft… 
Hey, Boss, you OK?! You can take it easy now. 
I-I'm fine… I'm so gonna win this!
Oh, yeah! I finished the third batch! 
Huhhh!? Y-You already finished it all!? 
Hehe… This was just another regular breakfast for me. 
Whew, that was a great meal. 
Too bad for you, Boss. That was close, you were just about to finish the third dish. 
You did great, but looks like ya still have a long way to go before you can beat me. 
Seems like eatin' three bowls in the mornin' is too much for ya. 
I give up… You completely smoked me this time, Kanna. 
Welp, now I can start the trip full of energy. 
K-Kanna, I finished my third plate! How do you like that? 
Aw, too bad. You were almost able to keep up with me! 
See, I'm at my fourth helping now, so I'm a whole plate ahead. 
R-Really? You sure are something, Kanna. 
You're somethin’ too, Boss. The fact you're keepin' up with me after just a month is amazin’. 
Just like people say, "Little and often makes much." You stickin’ with this is payin’ off. Hahaha! 
You can leave the tidyin' to me, Boss. 
I see, thanks. Next time, I won't lose. 
Hehe, that’s the spirit! Let's have another eatin' contest next chance we get! 
Sheesh, that was a lot more than I usually eat, even for dinner. 
Now then, it's almost time to meet up with everyone at the entrance. I should get going. 
Kanna is already done putting the dishes away. 
Her style is to always follow through with what she starts. 
No one's here. I guess everyone's already had breakfast. 
I wonder if Kanna will want to have another eating contest today.
Maybe I should try coming back again some time later. 
There's nothing much I can do in here, I better go to another place. 
I wonder if Mr. Yoneda is in his office. 
It’s Ogami. Are you there, Mr. Yoneda? 
… 
Seems like he's not there. 
I better check another room, I guess. 
I wonder if Mr. Yoneda is in here. 
I better check another room, I guess. 
It’s Ogami. Are you there, Mr. Yoneda? 
Oh, Ogami. Yeah, come on in. 
Right. Pardon me. 
Hello, Captain. 
Oh? What're you doing here, Maria? 
I wanted to give my regards to the manager before we left for the trip. 
We’re leaving the theater in your care, Mr. Yoneda. 
Of course, I got it all covered. 
Likewise, please keep an eye on everyone in the Flower Division. 
You can count on me. 
I'm rarin' to go. 
I'll have Maria with me. 
Of course, you can count on me. I'll make sure to lead everyone in the right direction. 
I leave them in your care then, Captain. 
Well, looks like I have nothing to worry about with you two chaperoning the group. 
Take it easy and make sure to have fun, you two. 
Yes, sir! 
I’m rarin’ to go! Can’t wait to let loose and go hog wild!
Haha, I like the enthusiasm but I think Maria is giving you dagger eyes. 
…Captain, please, restrain yourself a bit. 
Y-Yes! I’ll behave myself! 
Wahahahaha! <br> At any rate, take it easy and have fun, you two. 
You can relax, Mr. Yoneda. I'll have Maria by my side to keep everyone in check. 
Captain, please… 
Oho, I see you're placing a good deal of trust in her. 
Well, looks like I have nothing to worry about with you two chaperoning the group. 
Yes, sir. 
Hm? Ogami, were you about to say something? 
Ah… S-Sorry, I just dozed off… 
Hey, hey, are you OK? Is the summer heat getting to your head?
Good grief, Ogami’s always like this… Please take care of everyone, Maria. 
Ah… R-Right. 
Captain, please pull yourself together. 
Y-Yeah… Got it. 
Captain. Let’s do our best to make sure everyone has a safe and fun trip. 
OK. It's a big responsibility, but we'll pull it off together. 
Yes, it'll be up to us. 
Excuse me, then. I'll see you in the entrance hall at 10 o'clock. 
Having Maria with us is definitely reassuring. 
I need to step up so Maria can also enjoy this trip without any worries.
Ah, Mon Frère! 
Yo, Boss! Lookin’ for some snacks to bring along for the ride? 
Oh, I hadn’t thought of that. Are you thinking of bringing some? 
Yeah! I'm gonna bring lots of chocolates and candies! 
I wanna bring some onigiri or somethin’ else that will fill my stomach a bit more. 
If it were up to you, Boss, what would you bring?
I’d bring sweets.
I’d take something filling. 
If it were up to me… I’d bring along some sweets. 
Tee-hee! I knew it! 
You should bring lots of candy, too, Kanna! 
All right… That’s not a bad idea.
OK, you think 500 packs of chocolate and candy will be enough for everyone? 
(Do we even have that much in the theater?) 
If it were up to me… I guess I would bring something filling. 
Right? You can't have fun on an empty stomach! 
Think 20 onigiri per person will be enough? 
Nobody other than you can eat 20 rice balls, Kanna! 
O-OK… Then how about 10? 
That sounds less like a snack and more like a full meal… 
I don't need any snacks for myself. 
I mean, I just ate a huge breakfast with Kanna. 
Ahahahaha! You did, now that you mention it. 
If you get hungry later, I’ll split an onigiri with ya.
I’ll share half of my chocolate, too! 
Thanks, guys. 
'Kay, Iris. Let's get goin'. 
OK! See you later, Mon Frère! 
Snacks, huh… Almost feels like we’re going on a picnic.
All right, I should get going, too. 
We'll have to say goodbye to our usual cuisine at the theater while we're away on the trip. 
I wonder what kind of food they serve at the inn? Oooh, I'm getting excited just thinking about it. 
Welcome, Ogami! Would you like to buy something? 
Buy a bromide. 
Talk to Tsubaki. 
Leave. 
Could I take a look at the portraits for sale? 
Sorry, Ogami. I can only sell you one bromide per month.
Please understand, we need to keep some for the customers. 
You want to buy a bromide? Please, take your pick! 
That's a bromide of Sakura. 
Let's see… <br> Sakura's bromide, right? 
That’ll be 50 sen. <br> Thanks for your patronage! 
That's a bromide of Sumire. 
Let's see… <br> Sumire's bromide, right? 
That’ll be 50 sen. <br> Thanks for your patronage! 
That's a bromide of Maria. 
Let's see… <br> Maria's bromide, right? 
That’ll be 50 sen. <br> Thanks for your patronage! 
That's a bromide of Kanna. 
Let's see… <br> Kanna's bromide, right? 
That’ll be 50 sen. <br> Thanks for your patronage! 
That's a bromide of Iris. 
Let's see… <br> Iris's bromide, right? 
That’ll be 50 sen. <br> Thanks for your patronage! 
That's a bromide of Kohran. 
Let's see… <br> Kohran's bromide, right? 
That’ll be 50 sen. <br> Thanks for your patronage! 
That's a bromide of Orihime. 
Let's see… <br> Orihime's bromide, right? 
That’ll be 50 sen. <br> Thanks for your patronage! 
That's a bromide of Reni. 
Let's see… <br> Reni's bromide, right? 
That’ll be 50 sen. <br> Thanks for your patronage! 
Oh, so you're not going to buy anything?
We won't be able to see each other for a while, Ogami… 
But… You’ll be coming back, right? 
…Yeah. And when I return, please stop by again to buy some bromides. 
Of course. <br> I’ll be the first in line.
Ogami… Thank you very much! 
Hope you have a great time on your trip!
I look forward to hearing all about it when you get back.
Got it, I'll be going now. 
Tsubaki… <br> Come back safely, OK? 
Absolutely, leave it to me! I’ll come back as my usual cheerful self!
You too, Ogami. Please take care and good luck! 
My, you came here like clockwork, Ogami. 
If you're interested in hearing more gossip, I'm all out. Sorry.
I see, that's too bad. 
I'll have some more interesting tidbits to share another time, so look forward to it! 
Hi, Yuri, Kasumi. <br> Are you doing the last bits of cleanup? 
Yes, we just finished sorting the last of the documents. 
Before you leave on your trip, Ogami, let me share the latest gossip I’ve gathered.
Oh, Ogami. What do you need this time? 
You came to listen to my gossip. Right, Ogami?
Listen to some gossip. 
I'll come back later. 
I wonder what kind of secret mission Tsubaki is being assigned to… I’m so curious. 
Me too. Especially since neither you or Kasumi know anything about it. 
It must be important for all this secrecy… 
But regardless, I'm sure Tsubaki will be up to the task and come home safely. 
Right, right. This is Tsubaki we’re talking about, after all. There's no need to worry about her.
You’re not gonna believe this, Ogami. Kasumi said she saw a ghost in the storage room! 
Oh, not another word. Just thinking about it sends a shiver down my spine. 
So… What sort of ghost was it? 
Well, yesterday, Kasumi went down to the storage room to get some food for the kitchen pantry. 
She heard a moaning voice from inside the wall saying, “Leeeave iiittt heeere.”
Please, Yuri! <br> I told you to stop!! 
But, Kohran says she’s also been hearing weird voices in the storage room. Maybe there really is a ghost… 
How come you two aren’t joining us on the trip? 
We still have a lot to do around the theater, on top of helping Tsubaki with her transfer papers. 
What's more, I think Tsubaki would feel left out if she knew we all went on the trip without her. 
I see… 
Ogami, do you remember that yakuza boss? The one that got trapped in the fire at the ryotei. 
Huh? Oh, right. He was in the room that Sakura and Kohran infiltrated by mistake.
Yes, that one! I heard that he was rescued from the burning building by people in the surrounding area. 
Apparently, the kindness of those good Samaritans warmed his heart. 
Since that day, he’s turned over a new leaf and has begun serving the community.
Uh-huh, all of his gang members are cleaning up the streets as well. 
Earlier today, they were even cleaning the street in front of the theater. Deep down, they're good people.
Oagmi, have you read the latest editorial in today’s edition of the Capital Newspaper? 
No, I haven’t. Did the article talk about something interesting? 
“Steam Office in Turmoil over Measuring System." Right, Kasumi? 
Yes, precisely. 
"Turmoil over Measuring System"? What does that mean? 
As I understand, Japan is currently using several different measurement systems at the same time.
The most common are the Japanese shakkanhou system, the metric system, and the British imperial system.
And now the steam office is all mixed up because every area uses different systems to measure their pipes!
I see, that must be hard on them. 
Ah, that’s right. <br> Guess what, Ogami?
I heard that the resort you’re visiting is actually owned by one of the manager’s friends. 
…Huh, is that so?
Looks like he organized all the accommodations so the Flower Division could rest without any worries. 
He said that since it's his friend's resort, everyone should relax and make themselves at home.
I see, that’s just like the manager.
By the way, I heard that the Gakushuin Girls' School will begin accepting commoners this spring.
If I recall, Sumire graduated from there. 
Huh? So up until now, the general public were not allowed to attend Gakushuin?
That’s right. There used to be a rule that the school would only accept girls from noble families. 
But I heard this limitation was removed after a recent policy revision. That's a good change in my book.
However, it costs 5 yen just to take the entrance exam. Guess it's still a school for the rich. 
So most people still can’t get in, huh? Hmph, that's no fun. 
When summer comes around, the only thing on people’s minds is Koshien. Isn’t that right, Yuri?
You mean the baseball tournament that's been on the radio, right? I wonder who's gonna win this year. 
Oh, yeah. The venue for the middle school championships was changed to Koshien Stadium last year. 
Yes. It's said to be the largest baseball stadium in all of Asia. 
Speaking of which, you can’t help but root for your hometown team when it comes to baseball, huh? 
Hahaha, right. Now that you mention it, I wonder if my local team made it to Koshien this year. 
Sorry, Ogami, but I'm all out of gossip for now. 
I'll have some more interesting tidbits to share another time, so look forward to it! 
See you later then. Please take care of the theater while we’re away.
OK. Make sure to relax and enjoy yourself, Ogami. 
I'm looking forward to hearing all the juicy stories from your trip.
Make sure to fill me in on all the details when you get back, OK? 
…From there… <br> The sea… <br> After that, I… 
That voice. Is that you, Saki? 
M-My… Ogami? 
What are you doing in a place like this? 
I could say the same, Saki. I heard your voice coming from here… 
Tee-hee… I’m just really looking forward to our hot springs trip.
I got so excited thinking about all the fun we'll have that I must have started talking out loud.
Uh-huh… 
I just love hot springs, so I asked for special permission to come along. 
Bathing in the spring’s warm waters will do wonders for my skin and beauty… 
What do you want to get out of your visit to the hot springs, Ogami? 
Re-energize my soul. 
Have a drink in the baths. 
Rest my bones. 
I want to re-energize my soul. 
Oh, hmm-hmm. You’re as earnest as ever, Ogami.
Makes me want to share a bath so I can watch over you… 
I guess I'd like to have a nice drink in the springs. I bet that would feel great in an outdoor bath.  
My, that sounds lovely! 
Shall I pour your drink for you when the time comes? 
My body's been feeling real stiff these days. I just want to sit down and rest my bones. 
Oh my, that won’t do. 
I know, I'll give you a gentle massage after you're done bathing. 
I haven't put much thought into it, guess I'll just take a bath like I normally would. 
Hehe, not a bad idea. 
In that case, perhaps I could help scrub your back. 
…What?! R-Really? 
Hmhm, you’ll just have to… wait… and… see! 
I'll see you later. I can't wait for the trip. 
S-Saki… Was she being serious about that? 
I feel like this is going to be a memorable trip…
The scent of Saki's perfume is still lingering around a bit. 
There's no point in dawdling around here. Let's head to another room. 
Nobody's here… 
Well, there’s no need to use this room right before leaving on a trip.
The theater is between performances right now so these costumes will remain unworn for a while. 
In all likelihood, we might not even use this room until the autumn performance next month. 
I suppose no one will be using the dressing room while we’re away on summer break.
Although, I’m sure it will get plenty of use once we begin rehearsals after the trip. 
No one's on stage since there's no rehearsals. 
It is what it is. I should just go to another room.
We're holding our autumn show next month…
I'm sure everyone will give amazing performances after they return refreshed and recharged from our trip.
The theater is closed for summer break, so the doors are shut. 
Now that I think about it, I wonder who's going to do the night watch while I'm away… 
I hope this place will be filled with guests during the autumn performance next month. 
Well, judging from our last show, it should be fine.
The theater's on break for the summer, so there's no customers. 
OK, I better go to another room now. 
I wonder if Sakura is in her room.
It's just like Sakura to have a cute nameplate like this. 
OK, let's check another room. 
Yeees? Who is it? 
It's Ogami. <br> May I come in, Sakura? 
Ah, it's you, Ogami. The door's unlocked, come in. 
OK, sorry to intrude. 
Good morning, Ogami. 
Morning. Are you done with your preparations for the trip? 
Yes. I was thinking of bringing some medicine, just in case. 
Oh right, while I'm preparing for the trip, there's something I wanted to ask you. 
Between the colors red, blue, and yellow, which one do you like the most? 
Red, I guess. 
Blue, I guess.
Yellow, I guess.
Hmmm… Red, I guess. 
All right, red it is. <br> Thank you very much. 
Hmmm… Blue, I guess. 
All right, blue it is. <br> Thank you very much. 
Hmmm… Yellow, I guess. 
All right, yellow it is. <br> Thank you very much. 
Hmmm… <br> I don't have any favorite color in particular. 
Is that so… <br> That's a problem. 
I know, since you were in the Navy, how does blue sound? 
Huh? Oh… It's fine, I guess. 
Why do you ask? 
Uh… That's… 
I-It's nothing. Don't worry about it. 
Telling me not to worry only makes me more curious.
A-Anyway… I'm excited to go on this trip with everyone else. 
What are you looking forward to the most, Ogami? 
Having fun with everyone.
The delicious food. 
Seeing you in a swimsuit. 
Having fun and playing together with everyone, of course. That's what I'm looking forward to. 
I agree! I'm very excited for that, too. 
Going to the beach, having dinner together… I'm sure it'll be exciting. 
If we're talking about the trip, I'm looking forward to all the great meals we're going to have.
I agree. It's one of the things I'm looking forward to the most on this trip. 
That would be… Seeing you in a swimsuit, of course. 
…O-Ogami! 
Ah… Sorry, sorry. I didn't mean to tease you. 
Please stop joking around, you'll get me all embarrassed. 
Uh… There's so much I'm looking forward to. It's hard to choose just one. 
Hehe, now that you mention it, you're right. 
Anyway, I hope we can enjoy this vacation without any issues.
Yeah, absolutely.
OK, I still want to pack some more things, so excuse me. 
Yeah, got it. See you later, then. 
I wonder if Sakura is in her room. 
It's just like Sakura to have a cute nameplate like this. 
OK, let's check another room. 
…She's not here. 
I wonder if Sumire is in her room.
This is a pretty subtle design, considering it's Sumire. 
Let's check another room. 
Yeees? Who’s knocking?
Um… It’s Ogami. 
My, please come inside, Ensign. 
OK, sorry to intrude. 
Morning, Sumire. Are you done preparing for the trip? 
I need just a little more time. As you can see, I have quite a few items I need to bring with me.
Spare clothes, makeup, swimsuit, toiletries, my diary, and my tea seat, just in case.
I also have a book to read when I’m bored, my personal pillow… There’s still plenty left to pack. 
…Your pillow?
Yes. I wouldn't be able to sleep without my usual pillow.
Even when I was at my family's home, I went to the effort of having my pillow sent there for me.
Are you fine sleeping without your regular pillow, Ensign? 
I'm OK without it. 
No, I’m the same way.
I don't use pillows. 
I'm fine without it. I can sleep wherever, whenever. 
My, that's impressive. I suppose that fortitude comes from your naval training.
Hahaha, that's a strange thing to be praised for. 
Nah, I’m the same way. I have a hard time relaxing if I don’t have my pillow.
My, is that so? I’m surprised you have this delicate side to you. 
In that case, shouldn't you be bringing your pillow, too? 
Hahaha, it’s not that big of a deal. I'll manage. 
I do have a pillow in my bed, but I don't use it that much. 
My… How can you sleep like that? 
Uh… I guess it's easier for me to fall asleep than most people. 
I'm astonished to learn that there are people who can sleep without something as basic as a pillow.
…I hadn't given it much thought until now. 
Well, we do spend a third of our life sleeping, Ensign. 
It's only natural for people to pursue the most comfortable sleep possible. 
I-I see… 
Well then, Ensign. I still have much to prepare, so…
I must apologize, we’ll have to cancel our usual tea class in the salon today.
No problem, I understand. I’ll be going then. See you later, Sumire.
I wonder if Sumire is in her room. 
This is a pretty subtle design, considering it's Sumire. 
Let's check another room. 
It's Ogami… 
I'm sorry, Ensign, but preparations are taking longer than I expected. 
I see, sorry for interrupting. 
I wonder if Sumire is in her room. 
This is a pretty subtle design, considering it's Sumire. 
Let's check another room. 
There's no answer. Looks like she's not here. 
I wonder if Maria is in her room.
It's Maria's nameplate. 
OK, I'll check another room. 
It's Ogami. <br> Are you there, Maria? 
Oh, Captain, it's you. The door's unlocked, please come in. 
OK. Excuse me. 
Good morning, Captain. 
Morning, Maria. Are you all ready for the trip? 
Yes. I finished packing last night. 
I see… <br> Prepared as always, Maria. 
Now that I think about it, I don't visit your room too often. 
I suppose that’s true. But, as you can see, there isn’t much to show.
(Maria must have just recently gotten out of bed…)
(I wonder what she wears when she sleeps.)
(There are a lot of possibilities… <br> Pajamas, a yukata…)
Ask her. 
What kind of clothes do you wear to bed, Maria? 
Huh?! <br> Uh, about that, I don’t…
You don’t what?
It’s… Is it really that important to you? 
Huh? What's wrong with the question? 
Everything! 
Oh… S-Sorry. I suppose I shouldn’t have asked. 
… 
What are you looking at so intently? 
Er, nothing… 
It’s impolite to stare at a woman’s bed like that, Captain. 
(It’s rude to stare so intensely…)
(The desk has a simple yet functional design. Just like its owner) 
I really love that desk. I’ve been using it for a long time now. 
(That chair has the same design as her desk. Does she always go for simplistic designs?) 
That chair looks just like your desk. I guess you prefer simpler designs, Maria. 
Yes, I tend to gravitate towards things that are easy to determine at first glance. 
What kind of book are you reading? 
Ah, this isn't a book. <br> It's my diary. 
Do you keep one, Captain? 
Yeah, pretty much. 
No, I don't. 
I can't keep up with it. 
I don’t write in it often but I do have a diary.
I see, so you keep one as well. 
When I look at what I’ve written in my diary, I gain a new perspective on my past thoughts and actions.
No, I don't. 
Is that so? <br> Keeping one is rather fun. 
When I look at what I’ve written in my diary, I gain a new perspective on my past thoughts and actions. 
I’ve tried to, but I can never keep up the routine and end up stopping after a few days. 
Try to make a habit of writing in it at a certain time, like before bed or after dinner. 
Even writing a few lines for the day is fine. What matters is you're doing it consistently. 
I see… <br> I'll keep that in mind. Thanks. 
Oh… I’m sorry for prying into such a private matter, Captain. 
Oh, it's fine. <br> I don't mind at all. 
A diary, hmm? 
C-Captain!! What do you think you're doing?! 
Well… I just wanted to take a look inside… 
Captain, please! Don't just flip through a person's diary without permission! 
Oh… Sorry. 
*sigh*… <br> You surprise me at times. 
(Aw, I wanted to see what was in Maria's diary.) 
It’s a pleasant morning, isn’t it?
Yeah. Seems like we’ll have fine weather today.
Seeing a mirror like this reminds me that I'm in a woman's room. 
Heh, is that so? 
(There’s a photograph of everyone from the theater.)
Now then, I'll be taking my leave. 
I see. I’ve finished all my packing so I was about to leave as well. 
How about we get going, Captain? 
We should be finished with our business here. Let us depart. 
If I remember correctly, we should be gathering at the entrance hall at 10 o'clock. 
Yeah. What are you gonna do until then? 
Hehe… <br> Actually, I was reading my diary a moment ago…
And I was reminded of a game I once often played. So I may partake in a few rounds before we depart.
Well then, Captain. <br> Please excuse me. 
A game she used to play…? <br> I wonder what it is.
Well then, Captain. <br> Please excuse me. 
OK, I should get going now. 
I wonder if Maria is in her room.
It's Maria's nameplate. 
OK, I'll check another room. 
Looks like Maria's not here. 
I wonder if Kanna is in her room. 
Kanna's… Well, I guess it's more of a nametag than a nameplate. 
OK, let's check another room. 
Look's like Kanna's not here. 
I wonder if Kanna is in her room.
Kanna's… Well, I guess it's more of a nametag than a nameplate. 
OK, let's check another room. 
U… Uh… 
Who's… there? It's still… early in the morning… 
Hey now, Kanna, are you still sleeping? 
Oh, it’s you, Boss…
The door's unlocked, you can come in. 
OK, then. Excuse me… 
Fwaaaah… Mornin', Boss. 
…Huh? <br> Is it already this late? 
Kanna… Did you go to sleep dressed like that? 
Uuuh… Last night, I was exercisin' in here. Must've gone straight to bed right after that. 
Aw man, looks like ya caught me when I'm all messed up… 
Jeez, you're so sloppy! 
Show some decorum… 
It happens sometimes. 
Jeez, you're so sloppy! <br> Try to be a bit more disciplined.
Sorry, I’ll get my act together. 
I'll do better next time, so let me off easy, OK? 
…Just be careful, OK? 
You are a girl, after all… So try to show a bit more decorum.
Sorry, Boss. I'll be more careful next time. 
Hehe… I’m a girl, huh? <br> Now you got me blushin’. 
Well, it happens sometimes even when I'm tired. 
…Right, exactly. Same thing happens to you, too, eh?
But, I know it’s a bad habit, so I’ll be more careful from now on.
Uh, Boss… Are you mad? 
…Oh, no. I didn’t mean it that way. I just couldn’t think of what to say.
Can ya give me a pass this time? I'll be more careful. 
…Well, I better change my clothes ASAP so I don’t get left behind.
See you, Kanna. <br> Make sure not to be late. 
Yeah, thanks! <br> See ya later, then. 
Kanna, are you done yet? 
Oh, Boss. I'm still changin'. 
Thanks for waitin'. Now I'm ready for the trip. 
Are your bags packed and ready to go? 
Hehe, the secret to travelin’ is to only bring the bare essentials. 
I'm pretty used to travellin' all over, so I can pack my things pretty quick. 
Hahaha, if you say so. 
OK, now I wanna have some breakfast. 
You should come, too. We can have ourselves another eatin’ contest.
I'll see you later. Bye, Boss. 
Hi, Sumire. How's it coming along? 
Well, see… I'm having a spot of trouble. 
I was going to bring some literature to read in case I was struck with boredom during the trip…
However, now that I’m here, I can’t decide which book to take with me. 
Hahaha… Is that so? 
If you were in my position, what kind of reading material would you bring? 
A novel. 
A book related to my job. 
A schedule book. 
If I had to choose… I’d want to bring a novel I can really sink my teeth into, you know? 
I see… That sounds like a good idea. 
If I had to choose… I’d bring a job related book. Like something on military tactics or history.
That is a foul idea, Ensign… No one should bring their work with them on vacation. 
Everyone wants to have fun on this trip. Books like that would only bring down the mood.
I-I see… You have a point. 
Since we're going on a trip… We should bring a schedule book, don’t you think?
Oh my… That's quite the joke, Ensign. 
Your sense of wit is as sharp as ever. 
Uh… If it were me, I wouldn't bother bringing a book along. 
I just want to forget about my daily life and enjoy what the resort has to offer to the fullest. 
I see… You do have a point. 
Thank you, Ensign. You were most helpful. 
We will be rendezvousing in the entrance hall at 10 o'clock, correct? I suppose I will see you then. 
All right… I should get going too. 
Uh… No one's here. 
I guess everyone's busy preparing stuff for the trip. 
Oh, Mon Frère! <br> Good morning! 
I'm going to bring some cards along on the trip! 
I have to get going! See you later, Mon Frère! 
Iris is especially cheerful this morning. 
Well, I'm sure everyone's excited for the trip. 
Now, I should head to another room. 
Oh, if it isn't Maria. 
Ah, Captain. 
A while back, I learned how to play billiards in America and I wanted to brush up on my skills.
I see, so this is the game you remembered after reading your diary. 
Yes. If you’re up to it, Captain, would you like to play a round?
If you’re up to it, Captain, would you like to play a round? 
OK, let’s do it! 
I don't know the rules… 
OK, let’s do it! I’ve been eager to play a game on this pool table for a while. 
Haha. Well then, let's play a quick game of nine-ball. 
It'll be a nice way to kill some time before we depart. 
OK… Shall we play, then? 
I don't really know how to play billiards… 
In that case, I'll teach you while we play. 
Since we still have some time before we depart, let's play a quick game of nine-ball. 
The rules are simple. You strike the cue ball with your pool cue…
…and hit the ball with the lowest number. 
The winner is whoever first sinks the 9-ball into one of the holes around the table, called a pocket.
I see… Seems simple enough. 
Now then, why don’t we start a game.
Hmm, what to do… 
I think it'll be a nice way to spend some time before we have to leave. 
Playing a round of nine-ball won't take us much time. 
Well, all right then. <br> Let’s give it a go.
Sure. <br> We’ll play a quick game.
Now it's your turn, Captain. This is your chance to drop the 9-ball. 
For this shot, try building up some strength and then strike the cue ball with conviction. 
Strike. 
Give it all you got. 
OK… Here I go! 
Aw… <br> I guess that was too soft. 
You should have hit the ball a bit harder for that shot, Captain.
If you had used more strength, you might have sunk the 9-ball. 
Is that right… <br> I was so close. 
OK, now it's my turn. 
W-What the?! <br> The ball hopped! 
That was a jump shot. 
It's a technique used to leap over an obstructing ball to hit the target behind it. 
Wow… <br> Impressive as always, Maria. 
Heheh, you can learn it too if you practice. 
More power… and shoot! 
Yeah! The 9-ball didn't go in, but I was able to sink number 8! 
Well done, Captain. <br> You demonstrated good form with your arm as well.
Thanks for your advice, Maria. 
OK, now it's my turn. 
W-What the?! <br> The ball hopped! 
That was a jump shot. 
It's a technique used to leap over an obstructing ball to hit the target behind it. 
Wow… <br> Impressive as always, Maria. 
Heheh, you can learn it too if you practice. 
Oh… Oh, no. I was so nervous, I couldn't shoot. 
No need to be so tense, Captain. Try not not to overthink your shot.
It’s only a game. Lighten up and just have fun with it. 
Y-You're right, Maria. Thanks. 
For example, you could try a shot like this.
W-What the?! <br> The ball hopped! 
That was a jump shot. 
It's a technique used to leap over an obstructing ball to hit the target behind it. 
Wow… <br> Impressive as always, Maria. 
Hmhm. Normally, I don’t do trick shots like that. 
You should try just playing for the fun of it, without any fear of failure.
Yeah, got it. Thanks, Maria. 
I ended up losing to you, but I had a good time regardless. 
Just remember that if you don’t loosen up, you won’t be able to truly enjoy the game.
Similarly, I think this vacation will be a good way for everyone in the troupe to unwind and recuperate.
Yeah… 
Now then, it's time for me to leave, Captain. 
If you'd like, perhaps we can play billiards again. 
Of course. I'll beat you next time, Maria. 
Hmhm, I’m looking forward to it. Well then, I’ll see you in the game room sometime.
I'll have to ask Maria to teach me more about billiards another time. 
Someday, I'm sure that I’ll be able to win a game against her. 
No one's in here, huh. 
I wonder if everyone is busy preparing things for the trip… 
I wonder if Iris is in her room.
So Iris's nameplate is shaped like Jean-Paul… 
I better check another room, I guess. 
It's Ogami. <br> Are you there, Iris? 
Huh, Mon Frère? <br> Yaaay! Welcome! 
It's unlocked, come on in. 
OK, then. Excuse me… 
Are you done packing, Iris? 
Yeah. I started yesterday and I'm almost done… 
But I still have to finish my math homework and I don’t understand this part…
What should I do, Mon Frère? 
All right, I’ll teach you. 
How about you do it later?
All right, I’ll teach you what I can. 
Really? Yaaay, yaaay! <br> You're so kind, Mon Frère! 
OK, teacher. I’m ready for my lesson.
Hahaha. All right, you can count on me.
How about you do your homework after we get back from the trip? 
If I do that, won’t I just worry about it the entire time?
I want to get my math done now so I can enjoy this fun vacation.
Hmm… 
I know! Why don't you help me study like before, Mon Frère! 
Huh? Me? 
It’s decided! Please teach me, Mon Frère!
Oh, boy… OK, then. 
I see… Now that's a problem. 
I know! Why don't you help me study like before, Mon Frère! 
Huh? Me? 
Please, Mon Frère? Help me so I can have fun on the trip! 
Oh, boy… OK, then. 
Look here, Mon Frère… I don't really get these times tables. 
I see, that makes sense. We have our own system for times tables in Japan. 
I imagine it must be tough for you to learn, since you were born in France. 
Well, I think I remember some of them. 
35, 15… <br> 36, 18… <br> 37… <br> Uh, what was it again? 
It's 21. 
It's 24. 
It's 27. 
37, 21. <br> 3 times 7 equals 21. 
You're right! That was awesome, Mon Frère! 
37, 24. <br> 3 times 7 equals 24. 
OK… Huh? <br> That's not right, Mon Frère. 
The book says 37, 21. <br> 3 times 7 equals 21. <br> You got it all wrong! 
H-Huh? Sorry, my bad. 
37, 7. <br> 3 times 7 equals 27. 
OK… Huh? <br> That's not right, Mon Frère. 
The book says 37, 21. <br> 3 times 7 equals 21. <br> You got it all wrong! 
H-Huh? Sorry, my bad. 
Uh… You asked me so suddenly, my mind went blank. 
Hmm… Oh, there's an answer written here, it's 21. 
Oh, that's right! <br> 3 times 7 equals 21! 
You should have answered sooner. That's not cool, Mon Frère! 
…Say, Mon Frère. How am I supposed to memorize my times table?
Please give me some tips. 
Ways to memorize times tables, huh? Hmm… 
Visualize with marbles.
Use verbal repetition. 
Pin them to the wall. 
Iris, do you have any marbles? 
Yeah. Here you go. 
Let's create groups of three marbles. If we have 6 in each group, there's 18 marbles. 7 makes it 21. 
So each time you add another set to the group, the total increases by 3. 
It's hard to just memorize answers, but visualizing them like this makes it easier, right? 
You're right! 15, 18, 21, 24… Each of them adds three marbles! 
Thanks a lot, Mon Frère! <br> I got it right away! 
The best way is to just memorize the tables by saying them out loud repeatedly.
35, 15… <br> 36, 18… <br> 37, 21… 
By continuously saying them verbally, you’ll eventually be able to recite the tables by heart.
Oh, so it's like memorizing the script for our plays. I'll try it! 
A good way to memorize these tables is to constantly look at the answers.
If you pin the answers to a wall you look at every day, you’ll have them memorized in no time. 
Oooh! <br> You're so smart, Mon Frère! 
I’ll write them down and pin the paper to my door so I can memorize the answers!
Huh… What is the best way to memorize them? 
I guess it's just like Auntie Kaede said… 
The best way is to just say the tables out loud a lot.
Thanks a ton, Mon Frère! Because of you, I was able to finish all my homework before the trip!
Your times tables are very important, Iris. You'll forget them if you don't keep practicing. 
It'll be fine! I already memorized them! 
Come on, let's go outside! 
OK, let's go. 
OK, let's go. 
Review them later. 
OK, let's go. I want to check up on everyone else, too. 
Yay! OK, let's go, Mon Frère. Quick! 
Just so we're clear, you have to keep practicing them, OK? 
O-OK, got it. I'll do that once we get back from our trip. 
C'mon, Mon Frère, we have to hurry, it'll be time to leave soon! 
H-Hey, hey… <br> Don't go so fast, Iris! 
Thanks a lot for helping me, Mon Frère! 
OK, I'm gonna go now. Bye-bye! 
Hahaha. She skipped off faster than a bullet. Looks like she's in quite a good mood. 
Alrighty, let's check up on everyone else. 
I wonder if Iris is in her room. 
So Iris's nameplate is shaped like Jean-Paul… 
I better check another room, I guess. 
There's no response. Looks like she's already gone out. 
I wonder if Orihime is in her room.
The nameplate has a simple design, but it sure looks classy. 
Let's go check another room. 
Orihime, are you there? 
U… Uh… 
Mmm… <br> Zzz… Zzz… 
Is she still sleeping? 
Shout to wake her up. 
Open the door by force. 
Leave her be. 
Heeey, Orihime! <br> It’s almost 10 o’clock!
Mmmm… <br> So… annoying… 
You're going to be left behind if you oversleep! 
Left… behind?
Huh?! It's… <br> It's already this late?! 
Hey, now… <br> You're not gonna make it if you don't hurry. 
Mr. Ensign, you saved me. Just this once, I thank you. 
Never mind that, just change your clothes, quick! 
(Oh boy. That would have been terrible if I hadn't woken her up.) 
(I have to force my way into her room!) 
Uh…? 
…Wha! <br> W-Who's there!? 
Oh, you're finally awake. It's me, Ogami. 
M-Mr. Ensign?! <br> Do you intend to become a criminal at last?! 
Don't break into people's rooms!! 
N-No! The clock! <br> Look at the time! 
Huh?! It's… <br> It's already this late?! 
If I hadn’t woken you up, you would have overslept for sure.
But… But even so, there must have been a better way to wake me than barging into my room! 
I need to change, so get out! 
Oh boy… <br> This is quite the ruckus just before the trip. 
She'll just get angry at me if I wake her up, so I’ll leave her be. 
Let sleeping dogs lie… <br> I'll just head to another room. 
Uh… Should I or should I not wake her up? 
Well, she'll eventually get up on her own, so I’ll just leave for now. 
I wonder if Orihime is in her room.
The nameplate has a simple design, but it sure looks classy. 
Let's go check another room. 
Orihime, are you awake? 
Y-Yes… <br> I just finished changing into my clothes.
My thanks… <br> Sorry for taking up your time. 
Don't slack off! 
Be more careful next time. 
…Everything all right? 
Don't slack off and oversleep, Orihime! 
I-I did not  mean to oversleep on purpose! 
You made it just in time, but try to be more careful in the future. 
It's vexing to hear that warning… But this time, I suppose you're right. 
This seems out of character for you, Orihime. Is everything all right? 
Hearing your concern for me is humiliating, but I suppose there's no helping it. 
… 
Never once did I ever think you'd have to wake me up, Mr. Ensign. 
I hate Japanese men, but…
…I hate waking up early just as much.
I’m furious that the type of person I dislike the most is making me do the thing I dislike the most…
But, had you not woken me up… I might have otherwise missed the trip.
Should I be glad or mad…? <br> I don’t know anymore.
W-Well, as for me, I’m just happy you aren’t going to be late. 
I still have some things to prepare, so I need to go. 
Boy, looks like she was able to make it on time. 
There's no time left! I'm heading out first! 
Boy, looks like she was able to make it on time. 
I wonder if Orihime is in her room.
The nameplate has a simple design, but it sure looks classy. 
Let's go check another room. 
It's Ogami… 
I'm still getting ready! Don't talk to me! 
(She'll just get angry if I keep asking. I better leave her alone.) 
I wonder if Orihime is in her room.
The nameplate has a simple design, but it sure looks classy. 
Let's go check another room. 
Looks like she's already gone on to the entrance to meet up with everyone. 
There's not much time. I should get going too. 
This is Kaede's room. 
I better check another room, I guess. 
It's Ogami. <br> Are you there, Kaede? 
Oh, Ogami. The door's unlocked, come in. 
Right. Pardon me. 
Welcome, Ogami. <br> Did you need something? 
Have a chat. 
Ask about Ayame. 
Nothing in particular. 
It's very sunny outside. <br> At this rate, we’ll have ourselves another hot afternoon. 
That's true, it is the height of summer after all. 
That reminds me, Kohran said that at 9:30 she was going to pick tomatoes in the courtyard. 
Everyone else seems to be busy preparing for the trip.
Perhaps they are still doing some last-minute packing in their rooms.
I see… 
Speaking of packing, make sure to bring your Kinematron along, Ogami.
Y-Yes, ma'am! 
If it’s OK with you, Kaede… I would like to hear about Ayame. 
Why, of course. Hmm… <br> What should I talk about? 
No… Nothing in particular. 
I just wanted to see you. 
Oh, is that so? I'm happy to hear that, Ogami. 
Well then, I have to excuse myself. 
You're always welcome here. 
All right. <br> Well, I should get going. <br> Please excuse me. 
I'm glad I could talk with Kaede. I'll visit her again next time. 
This is Kaede's room. 
I better check another room, I guess. 
It's Ogami. <br> Are you there, Kaede? 
Oh, Ogami. 
I'm sorry, but I have to write these reports. 
I see. Then I'll see you later. 
Sorry, Ogami. Let's have a nice talk some other time. 
Phew… <br> Being in my own room is quite relaxing. 
Now, what should I do… 
Call someone. 
Take the Kinematron.
Get back to work. 
Call someone. 
Get back to work. 
I know, why don't I make a call? 
Oh, right. I need to take the Kinematron with me on the trip.
…There. Now I can contact the theater in case something goes wrong. 
Let's do this later. I still have other stuff to do. 
I wonder if Reni is here.
…It doesn’t seem like anyone is here.
It's just a piece of paper from a notebook. I suppose that's fitting for someone like Reni. 
OK, let's check another room. 
I wonder if Kohran is in her room.
There's no response… Looks like she’s not here.
A gear-shaped nameplate, huh? It's just Kohran's style. 
Let's check another room. 
Nobody's here. I wonder if everyone's busy preparing for the trip. 
Guess tea lessons with Sumire are postponed for now. 
Perhaps I should visit her room, just in case. 
Maybe everyone's still in their rooms. 
Nobody's here… 
Guess I better check another room. 
We'll be having our autumn performance next month. 
I hope these seats will be full of guests like our last play. 
The theater's on summer break, so no one's here. 
Let's check another room. 
It’s another sunny summer day.
I hope the weather will stay like this when we reach Atami. 
…I came back here again but it looks like there still isn’t anyone here.
There's not much time left. Let's check another room. 
Everyone's getting ready for the trip, so no one’s here right now. 
Well, let's check another room. 
Even though no one’s here, I keep coming back to this room.
Ah, Ogami. 
Sakura, are you hurt or something? 
No, I was just thinking that we should pack some medicine for the trip.
Do you have any suggestions on what I should bring, Ogami?
Motion sickness pills.
Bring some disinfectant.
Motion sickness pills. 
Bring some disinfectant.
…How about a love potion? 
I think it would be a good idea to bring some motion sickness pills for the long car ride to Atami. 
OK. I'll bring some of those. 
Although, it’s funny to hear you suggest pills for motion sickness when you pilot a Koubu.
People may get injured at the beach, so it'd be nice to have some disinfectant. 
I agree. I'll bring the first aid kit, then. 
Let's see… How about a love potion? 
Huh? L-Love potion? 
Hahaha, I’m only joking.
Oh… That was a surprise. 
… 
But, Ogami… Hypothetically, if the potion did exist, who would you use it on? 
…Huh? 
N-No! It's nothing! 
Uh… I don't really need anything. 
Are you sure? In any case, I'll pack some cold medicine.
There. Medicine's all ready. 
I'm going to leave, Ogami. See you later. 
Yeah. See you later. 
OK, I should get going, too. 
Looks like nobody's here, just the smell of disinfectant. 
I should check another room. I wonder if everyone's finished preparing for the trip. 
Oh! Morning, Chief. 
Good morning, Kohran. Have you been working on the Koubu this whole time? 
Hiya, Chief. 
Hi, Kohran. Are you doing maintenance on our Koubu? 
Yeah. We’re gonna be away from the theater for a while, so…
I wanted to make some adjustments so they’ll be ready to deploy at a moment’s notice.
Keep up the good work. 
You're overthinking things.
That outfit looks cool. 
Keep up the good work, Kohran. You know the Koubu better than anyone.
Thanks, Chief. Hearing that from you lifts my spirits. 
Leave these Koubu to me. I'll make sure they can move out in a jiffy if we need 'em to. 
Kohran, aren't you overthinking things? 
We're on a summer break, how about you try relaxing for a bit? 
You got it wrong, Chief. Evil doesn’t take vacations.
Besides, it’s because we’re going on break that we need to take care of them.
I-I see… 
You know, Kohran… You look really cool in that outfit.
Wha… Where the heck did that come from? You startled me, Chief.
This is just a work outfit. It's nothing compared to the gorgeous clothes everyone else wears.
They may be work clothes, but they suit you perfectly. I think you look really nice in that outfit.
R-Really? Thanks, Chief… 
Uh, Chief, say something will ya. I’m getting all embarrassed with you just standing there…
Uh… Oh, right. I was lost in thought. 
Ahahaha… You're a real carefree person, Chief. 
Say, Chief, are you familiar with the event that helped give birth to the Koubu?
The event that… gave birth to the Koubu? No, I can't say I am.
It happened dozens of years ago, during the American Civil War…
The Southern American Army was using black magic during their campaign against the North.
People were dropping like flies. The Northern Army had no way of warding off the South’s hexes.
…Or so it seemed! One day, they found a survivor after a battle that should have killed everyone!
That survivor was a lone baby, stuck inside a steam tractor.
That tractor was built using a cheap metal, made by mixing lead into iron.
It was that metal which held the power to defend against the supernatural… “Celesteel.”
Celesteel, huh… 
It’s thanks to their Celesteel armor that the Koubu can even fight against demons.
The entire underground level of the Imperial Theater is made of the stuff, too.
I see… <br> So that's how it happened. 
As for Celesteel, think my story was good enough to "sell" you on it? Ahahahaha! 
That was hilarious! 
Huh… What do you mean? 
That was hilarious! 
F-For real?! <br> I kinda forced it, though. 
No need to pretend it was funny. I don't like seeing someone lie. 
If the joke is too cheesy, just play the straight man and give me a comedic retort.
No… I really did think it was funny.
But, I’ll keep that in mind. 
Huh… What do you mean? 
I was trying to make a pun about Celesteel. I guess it didn’t land, huh?
Uh… 
Chief, if the joke is lame, you gotta respond with something like, “Oh, a wise guy, eh?”
It’s awkward for me if no one plays the straight man and retorts my bad pun.
I see… <br> I'll keep that in mind. 
Ah, it’s no biggie. But next time I’ll make you laugh for sure.
Ah, dear me… <br> Not a fan of puns, huh?
Ah, s-sorry. I was just dumbfounded after hearing that…
Well, no need to force yourself to laugh. But at least come back at me with a comedic retort.
It’s awkward for me if no one plays the straight man and retorts my bad pun.
I see… <br> I'll keep that in mind. 
OK now, I have to do one more thing before the trip. 
What’s that?
Today I'm gonna pick some tomatoes that I planted in the courtyard. 
I plan to start at 9:30. You should stop by and have a look. Later, then.
Picking tomatoes, huh… Sounds fun. 
I'll have to swing by the courtyard at 9:30. 
Kohran's not here. I think she went off to do something. 
Anyway, no one's here, so I'll just check another room. 
Looks like no one's around, only the Koubu and Eisenkleid. 
Oh well, guess I should go to another room. 
Huh? Looks like someone's in the bathroom. 
These clothes… These are Kohran's. 
T-That means… Kohran's in the bath… 
I am drawn to the bath…
Go back outside. 
O-Oh, no… <br> My body is moving towards the bathroom on its own… 
(Kohran…) 
(She must have taken off her glasses, so maybe she won't notice me…) 
…! 
U-Uh-oh! 
Don’t panic, remain calm. 
Get out of there.
Don’t panic, remain calm.  
I'm sure she won't notice me since she took off her glasses… 
Ch-Chief!? 
Eh!? Your glasses… Are you wearing them!? 
Get outta here, Chief! Right now! 
S-Sorry! I'm getting out! 
… 
I’m sorry, Kohran. I just kind of wandered in…
Unlike the showers, this bathroom is huge, so I have to wear my glasses. 
Looks like keeping them on was a wise decision.
Sorry… I regret my actions.
Well, since you apologized so earnestly, I'll forgive you this one time. 
Do that again and I'll never let you forget it. 
Phew… <br> Somehow I got away without getting yelled at. 
Huh. So she takes baths with her glasses on. 
(I gotta get out of here before she sees me!) 
Phew… <br> I think I got away before she realized I was there. 
Had I'd been just a moment slower, I might not have made it. That was too close… 
Ah… Uhm… I… 
Ch-Chief!? 
Eh!? Your glasses… are you wearing them!? 
Get outta here, Chief! Right now!
S-Sorry! I'm getting out! 
… 
I’m sorry, Kohran. I just kind of wandered in…
Unlike the showers, this bathroom is huge, so I have to wear my glasses. 
Looks like keeping them on was a wise decision.
Sorry… I regret my actions.
Well, since you apologized so earnestly, I'll forgive you this one time. 
Do that again and I'll never let you forget it. 
Phew… <br> Somehow I got away without getting yelled at. 
Huh. So she takes baths with her glasses on. 
She must be cleaning herself up after working on the Koubu so much. 
I better not bother her and walk away. 
OK. Looks like she didn't notice. 
Now, let's go to another room. 
Phew, washing up after a long maintenance session sure hits the spot. 
Well, I guess it’s almost time to go. 
(Ack! Her glasses… She's still wearing them!) 
(I gotta get out of here before she sees me!) 
Phew… <br> I think I got away before she realized I was there. 
Had I'd been just a moment slower, I might not have made it. That was too close… 
Hiya, Chief. 
H-Hey, Kohran. Uh… Are you finished with your bath? 
Yup. Having a bath after doing maintenance sure feels great. 
I cleaned up and changed my clothes. Now I'm ready to get back to it. 
Well, I’m off to harvest my tomatoes. See ya, Chief.
Relaxing in a bath after a job well done certainly is refreshing.
…Anyway, I should stop daydreaming and head to another room. 
Looks like no one's taking a bath right now. 
Well, we’ll have plenty of time to bathe in Atami’s hot springs.
…Captain. 
Oh, it's you, Reni. What are you doing here? 
I'm researching the geography of our destination in Atami. 
Our enemies may strike while we're there. 
That's so like you, Reni.
Impressive, but rest first.
Isn't this a bit overkill?
Thinking about combat even as we're going on vacation… That's so like you, Reni. 
…Is that so? It’s just the natural thing to do. 
I'm happy you're not neglecting that stuff, but rest is more important. 
Our summer break just started, taking the time to recuperate is important, too. 
…Right. I know. 
Reni… Don’t you think this is a bit overkill?
After all, we're going on vacation. Forget about combat and take a rest. 
…The enemy does not go on vacation.
Uh… 
… 
The resort is located near both the ocean and mountains. 
Our enemies might not attack during our vacation, but we cannot afford to let our guard down. 
Reni… Cautious as always. 
However, it is important to stay alert and not let our guard down, even while on vacation.
I hope we won't have to use this room during our break. 
There's no use in worrying about it. Let's just enjoy the trip as much as we can. 
Wha… What's that sound?! 
…!? <br> The noise sounded like it was coming from behind this wall. 
And then… it seemed to just stop the moment I got here. 
Check the wall. 
Pretend to leave. 
Leave. 
I'm gonna check the wall. 
… 
… 
Uh… Doesn't seem to be anything out of place. 
(OK… I'll pretend to leave.) 
That's weird, I thought I heard something. Was it my imagination? 
Can't do anything about that, better check out another room. 
… 
(Just as I thought…) 
Who's there!? 
Ugh… What's happening here? 
Hmm… Maybe there's construction going on, I don't know… 
I'm curious, but I don't have time to find out… Let's check another room. 
…The sound is gone. 
Hmm… Was it just my imagination? 
As you’d expect, no one is working out right before our trip.
Guess no one's here. Let's head to another room. 
Now that it's midsummer, maybe there's a chance I'll go swimming in the pool. 
Well, I guess I can swim to my heart's content during the trip. 
Thought I’d come check one more time, but… Still no one here.
No one's in the pool right now. We're all going to swim at the beach, after all. 
Smells like nice soap in here. Maybe it's because Kohran just took a bath. 
There's no use in standing idly by here. Let's move to another room. 
We're gonna have a bath in Atami, so there's no need to take one right now. 
Let's just head to another room. 
The heat from the steam processor makes this room hotter than the others. 
Ugh, I'm starting to sweat. What am I doing in this place anyway? 
…Ah!! <br> 10 o'clock snuck up on me! 
I'm gonna get left behind if I don't hurry to the entrance! 
Hey, everyone. Thanks for waiting. 
Oh, you're right on time. I'm sure everyone will be here soon. 
Hey Boss! Hey Kaede! <br> Sorry to keep you waiting.
Man, I was rushing to get here, too. Glad I made it in time. 
Sakura and Orihime are also here. 
All members present and accounted for, Kaede.
Thank you. 
I-I'm sorry, I was a bit late getting here. 
It's not good to be tardy, Ogami. 
You're making me worry about how the trip will go. 
Yes, I apologize… 
Here, your Kinematron. You mustn't forget it. 
Ah, I’m sorry! It totally slipped my mind!
Still, isn't Atami quite far away? 
How are we traveling there? We aren’t flying in the Soaring Whale, are we? 
Ahahaha! You’d arrive in Atami in the blink of an eye if you flew in that. 
But I wouldn’t hear the end of it from the higher-ups if we deployed the Whale.
Then how are we getting to Atami? 
Take a look out front. I got a ride ready for you. 
Wooow! What a big car! 
This is a steam bus. <br> I reserved it exclusively for your trip. 
Hooo boy, a private bus. This sure is fancy. 
Well done, Mr. Yoneda. <br> What a grand idea. 
Gwahahahaha! I told you I'd take care of everything. 
All right, I hope you all enjoy your trip. 
And Ogami, please watch over everyone. 
Yes, ma’am, we're off! 
Will the theater be OK?
Yes, ma’am, we're off! Please take care of the theater in our stead! 
Of course, you can count on us. 
But… Are you sure everything will be all right while we’re away?
We’re going to be away for a while… Are you sure the theater will be OK?
… 
Are you worried about the theater, Ogami? 
Y-Yeah… I'd be lying if I said I wasn't. 
Bah, no need to worry. 
You see, we got some extra muscle to lend us a hand.
Huh, extra muscle?
Hey boys, come on out and show yourselves! 
Imperial Assault Troupe, Rose Division, reporting for duty! 
R-Rose Division!? 
Wh-Who on earth are these people…? 
These men are the Rose Division. They'll be watching over the theater while you're all away. 
Pleased to meet you, Ensign Ogami. I'm Kotone Seiryuin… 
I am the captain of the secret unit of love and beauty, the Rose Division.
Ichirooo! <br> I've always wanted to meet you! How about a smooch?
U-Uwaaahh! Please don't! 
Now wait a minute, Yokihiko! You have to give a proper introduction first!
Oh, dear me. I’m so sorry. Where are my manners?
I'm Yokihiko Ota, also of the Rose Division. 
Now you too, Kiku. <br> You haven’t introduced yourself either, right?
Yes! A-Ah, uhm… <br> Hello… Ogami… 
My name is… Kikunojo Oka. It’s a pleasure to meet you.
Hehe. Well, Kikunojo? <br> How does it feel to finally meet your beloved Ensign Ogami? 
Oh, S-Stop it, Kotone. That’s… Uhm… It feels… fantastic.
Just who are these people?! This… lot of eccentrics?
Now, now. Despite their appearances, these guys are some of the Imperial Army's finest. 
Hey, aren't you going to say hello, Ogami? 
Oh… U-Uhm… 
H-Hello… 
I'm Ichiro Ogami. 
H-Hello… 
You guys are fabulous. 
H-Hello… Nice to meet you… 
Oh my, why so nervous, Ichiro? Ooh-ho, how cuuute!
Ah… What a bashful person, I can’t help but love him.
Nice to… meet you too… 
I'm Ichiro Ogami. <br> Nice to meet you, everyone. 
Ah, lovely! How gallant! Take me, I’m yours!!
As one would expect from a naval ensign. Even a man would fall for your refined manners and kindness.
You're so cool, Ogami. 
Well, aren't you all fabulous. I'm surprised. 
Dear me, you're such a smooth talker, Ichiro! Let me give you a big smooch!
N-No thanks! 
Oh, you called us "fabulous." I'm so happy to hear that. I could cry… 
Ah, you certainly have a sense for beauty. Just what you would expect from the Flower Division's captain.
… 
Hmhmhm… <br> It appears you are so mesmerized by my looks that you have become speechless. 
Please, Kotone! <br> Don't be so full of yourself. 
He must be mesmerized by my physical beauty and stature! 
Hey, now wait a minute! <br> I…  
Oho, you're blushing! <br> So innocent, Ichiro. <br> How cute! 
Apparently he's been captivated by each of our beauty. 
Is… Is that so?! <br> I'm… so happy. 
S-Sorry, Mr. Yoneda, I need to ask you something, just to make sure… 
Ahh, yes. Despite what first impressions may lead you to believe, these fellows are all men. 
Huuuh? But why are they acting so ladylike?! 
Iris, there are all kinds of people in this world. 
Eheheh, there are many like them in the courts of Europe. 
But, to leave the theater in their care… 
Will it really be OK? 
Come on, don't worry. As I said, they may not look it, but these men are some of the Army's finest soldiers.
Affirmative. We shall protect the theater and General Yoneda. 
So please, enjoy your vacation! 
P-Please… Have a safe trip… 
Fareweeeell! 
(Uh… Instead of taking it easy, why am I getting more worried?) 
Sorry Ogami, but customers are only allowed to purchase one of each bromide. 
I see. That's too bad. 
So sorry, Mr. Ogami, but customers are only allowed to purchase one of each bromide.
Oh, really? That's too bad.

Ayame and I almost never lived in the same household, even though we were sisters. 
Eh…? 
It's not so unusual, given our lineage. We have less a family tree and more a family wisteria. 
Yet, I still knew that she was the type of person that would sacrifice her own well-being for others… 
Carrying everyone's burdens by herself… 
That's why, when I received the news that she had passed away, I made up my mind. 
I want to carry on her will. I want to protect the capital, just like she did. 
And for my own sake, too. 
…I suppose that's all I have to say. 
You know, Ogami, I came here to work of my own volition. 
To protect the peace of this city, and to cherish our audience's smiles. 
I'm sure you feel the same, Ogami. 
Yes, of course. 
So let's both do our best. 
For my sister… <br> For everyone… 
Yes, ma'am! 
Well, today I will tell you about the Anti-Kouma Corps. 
The Anti-Kouma Corps was the Army's predecessor to the Imperial Assault Troupe. 
Ikki Yoneda, Kazuma Shinguji, Shinnosuke Yamazaki, and… Ayame Fujieda. 
A special unit, comprising only those four, formed to defend the capital from evil. 
Seven years ago… A Kouma appeared in Nihonbashi. 
Even though it was just a single Kouma, the military and police were powerless against it. 
However, the Anti-Kouma Corps managed to seal the Kouma away, albeit at great cost. 
That incident made the government painfully aware of the need to defend against such evil. 
As a result, the Imperial Assault Troupe as you know it was born. 
The troupe is the fruit of the Anti-Kouma Corps' will. 
And, of the four members, only General Yoneda is still alive today. 
For the sake of those four, who protected the people from evil… We have to keep fighting. 
… 
Now then, today I'll tell you about Ayame's travels. 
In order to recruit members for the Flower Division, Ayame traveled around the world. 
She searched for suitable Flower Division candidates, girls with powerful spiritual abilities.
She sent me letters from various countries. America, France, China… 
Whenever she did, I must be honest, I envied her. 
I see, so she did all that… 
Those same candidates make up the Flower Division we have now. 
And you know what, Ogami? Recently, I've been thinking… 
The people Ayame chose truly were the best people for the job. That includes you. 
Kaede… 
Ayame entrusted the Flower Division to me, so I'll continue to give it my all. 
Don't give up. Even in the hardest of times, remember to never give up, Ogami. 
Yes, ma'am! <br> I will do all I can to meet your expectations! 
Now then, today I'll tell you about Ayame and Major Yamazaki. 
Both Ayame and Major Yamazaki were members of the troupe's predecessor, the Anti-Kouma Corps.
Major Yamazaki was a brilliant scientist who created the foundational designs for Spirit Armor… 
And they say he had a stronger sense of justice than most. 
Anyone could see that Ayame and Major Yamazaki were deeply in love with each other… 
But their relationship crumbled when the Kouma War started. 
What could have possibly caused that? 
Now, this is pure conjecture… 
But it seems that during their battles, Major Yamazaki became obsessed with certain questions.
“What are these demons?" "Why do they exist?" 
And "how are they so powerful?" 
General Yoneda noticed that Major Yamazaki had changed, and he warned him many times. 
But, in the end, no one could change his mind. 
Not even Ayame… 
When the Kouma War ended seven years ago, Major Yamazaki went missing. 
And then in our recent battles, he appeared again as Aoi Satan. 
Justice by power… <br> Rule through evil… 
Perhaps that was his conclusion… 
Back when he appeared in front of the theater six months ago… 
I wonder what Aoi Satan… No, what Major Yamazaki was trying to tell us…
