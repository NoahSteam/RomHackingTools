Wh-what's going on…? <br> What happened here…?
Where is everybody? <br> They're supposed to be here…
Ensign… Where could everyone be?
Where is everybody? <br> They were supposed to have gone ahead of us…
That's weird… <br> Where the hell is everybody?!
Mon Frère… <br> There's no one here… <br> What's going on?
Where's everybody hiding? <br> Y'all can come out now!
Where is everybody? <br> Come on out already!
I don't sense anyone here… <br> Where… are they?
Where is everybody?! <br> Please, answer me!
Worried about your friends?
It's been a while… Ichiro Ogami.
…Wh-What?!
I-It can't be…
Didn't you all die back at Akasaka?!
Heheheh… <br> Until we've fulfilled our duty, we may never die…
Heheh, that's right, and we just finished getting some payback on the guys before you.
Payback? <br> What did you do to the others?!
"The guys before you…" <br> What have you done to the others?! Answer me this instant!
Payback? <br> You don't mean…?!
Payback…? <br> What… What the hell did you do to the others?!
Where did you put everybody?!
"The guys before you"?! <br> You don't mean the others, do you?!
"The guys before you"…? <br> What exactly do you mean by that?! Answer me!!
What did you do to the others?!
You want to see them? <br> Fine, we'll show you.
Take a good look, because you're never going to see them again!!
C-Captain… <br> I'm sorry…
O-Ogami… <br> I'm sorry…
This is what happens to those who oppose us.
G-Guys!!
Assault Troupe, you are about to bear witness to the breaking of the final seal in the Octogram of Demonic Calling…
Octogram of… Demonic Calling?!
Wh-What is that?!
What are you plotting?!
Wh-What is that?!
Heheheh… Fine, I'll tell you, since you're not long for this world.
There are gates sealing the capital's wicked power… Together, they make the Octogram of Demonic Calling.
You… What are you all plotting?!
Heheheh… Fine, I'll tell you, since you're not long for this world.
There is a cursed power sealed away within the Capital… And we plan to unleash it.
…
…Are you afraid, Ogami?
Once we lift the final seal, the preparations will be complete…
An evil pulse courses through this land! O eight gates that seal this capital, open and reveal yourselves to us!!
EEEEEK!!
Wh-What in the world?!
Wh-What?!
W-Whoooa!!
Mon Frèreeee!!
Wh-What the heck?!
EEEEEEEK!!
Something's… happening!
Wh-What is that…?!
I was hopin' I'd get to throw down with you personally… But orders are orders.
And I'm afraid I have no interest in trapped prey.
All we have to do is eliminate you, and it'll all be over.
Come forth, Kouma! <br> Devour them with your greedy maws!
A-Are these… Kouma?!
Kouma!! Wh-What on earth is going on?!
It can't be… Kouma?!
Guh! K-Kouma just appeared outta nowhere!!
Mon Frère, there's so many of them!!
C-Crap! Kouma! <br> And not only that, they're covered in machinery!
Are these… Kouma?! <br> They're disgusting!
Kouma… <br> And they're covered in machinery!
Urgh… <br> We're surrounded…
But we can't give up! <br> We have to rescue everyone and eliminate all these Kouma!
