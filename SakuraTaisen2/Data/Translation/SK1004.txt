Whoops, it's almost 8:30. 
Can't dawdle around too long. Better head to my room and get changed. 
Whoops, I still haven't changed. 
I'm going to visit Sakura's family, I'd better dress right. 
I wonder if Sakura's ready yet. 
It's just like Sakura to have a cute nameplate like this. 
We can't wait around too much longer, so I'll call out to her. 
Sakura, I'm here. 
OK! I'll be right out! 
Sorry to keep you waiting. 
Wow, Ogami, you got all dressed up for this? 
Wouldn't want to be rude. 
How do I look? 
I'm meeting your mother, after all. Wouldn't want to be rude. 
Heehee, you really didn't have to… 
But I think that suit looks great on you, Ogami. 
R-Really? Thanks. 
I figured I'd put on something nice, since we're going out. How do I look? 
It suits you very well. 
You actually dressed up for me… 
I'm so glad… 
Sakura… 
U-Um… 
Heehee, no need to be shy, Ogami. 
I think that suit looks great on you. 
Y-You think so? Thanks, Sakura. 
Well then, let's say goodbye to the manager and be on our way. 
OK, got it. We'll ask him to hold down the fort while we’re away. 
Right! Let's head to his office. 
I wonder if Sakura is in her room. 
Oh, Ogami? <br> Did you need something? 
No, not particularly… 
I see. That's good. I was just about to leave for Sendai. 
I'll be going now. I'll miss the train if I don't hurry. 
Give your mom my regards.
Get me a souvenir. 
Safe travels. Give your mother my regards. 
Thank you. I'll be sure to tell her. 
Get me a souvenir while you're there, OK, Sakura? 
Heehee, understood. Look forward to it. 
I'm going to be late for the train, Ogami, so if you don't mind… 
Y-Yeah, right. Sorry. 
I'll be going, then. <br> Have a pleasant New Year's vacation, Ogami. 
Yeah, see you. 
She left… 
I should get dressed and get ready to leave, myself. 
Sakura just left for Sendai, right? 
No use staying here with her gone. I'll go visit another room. 
Whoops, I still haven't changed. 
I'm going to visit Sumire's family, I'd better dress right. 
I wonder if Sumire's ready yet. 
We can't wait around too much longer, so I'll call out to her. 
This is a pretty subtle design, considering it's Sumire. 
Sumire, I'm here. 
Yes, just a moment. 
Apologies for the wait, Ensign. 
Well, Ensign… Aren't you well dressed. 
Wouldn't want to be rude.
How do I look? 
I am meeting your parents, after all. Wouldn't want to be rude. 
Oh, Ensign. You shouldn't worry about that. 
But I must say, that's a fabulous suit. 
Y-You think so? Thanks, Sumire. 
I figured I'd put on something nice, since we're going out. How do I look? 
Yes, it suits you very well. 
There's not a doubt in my mind that together we'll be the center of attention. 
R-Really? Now I'm feeling kinda shy… 
U-Um… 
There's no need to be shy, Ensign. 
I think that suit looks fabulous on you. Have some confidence. 
Y-You think so? Thanks, Sumire. 
Well then, Sumire, shall we get going? 
Why don't we bid farewell to the manager before we leave? 
Yeah, you're right. We'll let him know, just to be safe. 
Right then, let's make our way to the manager's office. 
There, the door's locked tight… 
Hey, Sumire. <br> Heading out already? 
Oh my, Ensign… 
Yes, I was just about to go on my trip. 
Well, I say "trip," but my home is in Yokohama, so I'll be there in no time at all.
Give my regards.
You coming back this time? 
Safe travels. Give your family my regards. 
I did force my way into your estate during the arranged marriage incident, after all. 
Understood. I'll be sure to let them know. 
Sumire… You WILL be coming back this time, right? 
Ohohohoho. You need not worry, Ensign. 
I don't believe my family has any intention of keeping me there anymore… 
And even if they did, this time I would force my way out on my own. 
Sumire… 
Did you need something, Ensign? 
N-No, not really… 
Then I'll be on my way. Have a lovely New Year, Ensign. 
Yeah, thanks. 
She left… 
I should get dressed and get ready to leave, myself. 
Sumire just went back home, right? 
No use staying here, then. I should visit another room. 
Whoops, I still haven't changed. 
I'll be visiting Count Hanakoji, so I'd better dress right. 
I wonder if Maria's ready yet. 
We can't wait around too much longer, so I'll call out to her. 
It's Maria's nameplate. It has a simplistic design. 
Maria, I'm here. 
Captain? I'll be right out. 
Apologies for the wait, sir. 
Oh, you changed into your formal wear. 
Wouldn't want to be rude. 
How do I look? 
I'm going to be meeting Count Hanakoji. Wouldn't want to be rude. 
I see. Considerate as always, sir. 
I figured I'd put on something nice, since we're going out. How do I look? 
Yes, it suits you quite well. 
Really? Hearing you say that makes it worth having changed. 
Captain… Um… 
That suit… looks good on you. 
Maria… Thanks. 
Right then, shall we get going? 
Why don't we stop and say goodbye to the manager before we go? 
Yeah, OK. We should let him know we’re leaving before we head out.
All right. To the manager's office, then. 
Oh, Captain. 
On your way out, Maria? 
Yes. I'm going to give Count Hanakoji my New Year's greetings. 
Give him my regards. 
That's a lot of trouble.
I'm sad I can't go with you, but make sure to give the count my regards. 
All right, understood. I'll give him your well wishes. 
Sounds like a lot of trouble for a New Year's greeting. 
Yes, but I owe a lot to Count Hanakoji. 
If you don't need anything, sir, then I'll be going. 
R-Right. Sorry. 
Well then, I'm off. Have a pleasant New Year's holiday, Captain. 
Yeah, thanks. See you. 
Right. I should get dressed and get ready to leave, myself. 
Maria left to visit Count Hanakoji, right? 
No use staying here, then. I should go to another room. 
Whoops, I still haven't changed. 
Since we're going all the way to Okinawa, I'd better dress up right. 
I wonder if Kanna's ready. 
We can't wait around too much longer, so I'll call out to her. 
Kanna's nameplate… It looks more like a nametag to me. 
Kanna, I'm here. 
Hey, I've been waitin' for ya! I'll be right out. 
Yo, sorry to keep you waitin’! 
Ooh! You're all decked out, eh, Boss? 
Figured I'd dress up. 
How do I look? 
We're traveling all the way to Okinawa, so I figured I'd dress for the occasion. 
Ahahaha! You didn't have to put in that much effort, though. 
Still, you look cool, Boss. I'm not just sayin' that, either. 
Hahaha, really? Thanks, Kanna. 
I thought I'd dress in something more formal… How do I look? 
You're lookin' cool, Boss. 
I'm so used to seein’ you in your regular uniform, so this feels kinda fresh. 
Hahaha, thanks. 
Anyway, I didn't know you had clothes like that. 
I’m so used to seein’ you in your regular uniform, so this feels kinda fresh.
Hahaha, well, I haven't had many opportunities to dress up like this. 
All right, Kanna, shall we get going? 
Before we do, how's about we tell the manager goodbye? 
Yeah, you're right. We should let him know we’re leaving before we head out. 
All right, let's swing by the manager's office. 
I wonder if Kanna is in her room. 
Oh, Boss? What's up? 
Nothing, I just thought you might've left already. 
I was just thinking of headin’ out, actually. 
I'm gonna spend some time in Okinawa and visit my dad's grave. 
Excited for my souvenir. 
Don't be gone too long, OK?
Safe travels. I'm looking forward to my souvenir. 
Yeah, don't worry, I'll bring back tons of rare Okinawan goodies. 
Don't be gone too long, OK?
Yeah, got it. I'm not trainin’ like last time, though, just visitin’. 
I'll make sure to be back before the New Year's holiday's over. 
If you don't need anything, Boss, I'm gonna get goin'. 
R-Right. Sorry. 
All right, I'm off. See ya when I get back! 
Yeah. Have a safe trip, OK? 
Yeah, yeah, I know. See ya, Boss. 
Kanna's gone now, huh? 
I should get dressed and get ready to leave, myself. 
Kanna already left for Okinawa. 
There's no use staying around here. I should go somewhere else. 
Whoops, I still haven't changed. 
I'll be meeting Iris's parents, so I'd better dress up right. 
I wonder if Iris is ready. 
We can't wait around too much longer, so I'll call out to her. 
So Iris's nameplate is shaped like Jean-Paul. 
Iris, I'm here. 
Okey-dokey! Just a second! 
Sorry to keep you waiting, Mon Frère. 
Wooow! You look cool, Mon Frère! 
Wouldn't want to be rude. 
How do I look? 
I'm meeting your parents, after all. I wouldn't want to be rude. 
Thanks, Mon Frère. I'm sure Papa and Mama will be impressed. 
I figured I'd put on something nice, since we're going out. How do I look? 
You look super cool! 
Kinda feels like we're going on a date! 
Hahaha, thank you Iris. 
Thanks for dressing up so nicely for me, Mon Frère… 
Hahaha, I'm always wearing the same old uniform, so I figured I'd change things up. 
Right, we should get going, Iris. 
Let's go say bye to Uncle Yoneda before we go! 
Yeah, you're right. We'll let him know we're leaving. 
OK, Jean-Paul, let's get going. 
Ah, Mon frère! 
Hey Iris. Off to see your papa and mama? 
Uh-huh! Jean-Paul's coming along too! 
Papa and Mama came all the way from France by boat, so I'm meeting them at the harbor. 
Tell them I said hi. 
Can you get there alone? 
Sorry I can't be there to greet them, but tell your parents I said hi, all right? 
OK. I'm gonna tell them so much about you! 
Hahaha, thanks. 
Can you get to your parents by yourself? 
Auntie Kaede told me how to get there, so I'll be all right! 
Papa and Mama are gonna be so surprised when they see I made it all the way to the harbor by myself!
Hahaha, I see now. Just be careful on the way, OK? 
OK! Thanks, Mon Frère! 
I'm gonna have lunch with Papa and Mama… 
And then I'm gonna tell them all kindsa stories… And then… And then… 
I'm gonna be with them the whole time! 
Hahaha, I see. Have fun. 
All right, I gotta go now. Bye-bye, Mon Frère! 
Yeah, see you. 
She left… 
I should get dressed and ready to go, myself. 
Iris said she was meeting her parents at the harbor, right? 
I should get ready to head out, too. 
Whoops, I still haven't changed. 
I'm making the trip all the way to Kobe, so I'd better dress up right. 
I wonder if Kohran's ready. 
We can't wait around too much longer, so I'll call out to her. 
A gear-shaped nameplate, huh? It's just Kohran's style. 
Kohran, I'm here. 
Oh, Chief? Hang on, I'm coming. 
Heheh, all right, let's go… 
Ch-Chief? What's with the getup? 
Thought I'd dress up.  
How do I look? 
Since we're traveling to Kobe, I thought I'd dress up for the occasion. 
I see… Thanks a bunch, Chief! 
You dressed to the nines, just for me. For real, thanks. 
Kohran… 
I thought I'd dress in something more formal… How do I look? 
I was kinda shocked at first, but it looks great on you! 
Besides, your usual outfit leaves such a strong impression, this feels kinda fresh. 
Hahaha, I see. 
At any rate, I never knew you had an outfit like this. 
I'm so used to your regular vest and suspenders, this feels kinda fresh.
Hahaha, well, I haven't had many opportunities to dress up like this.
All right, let's go talk to Yoneda before we duck out. 
Yeah, OK. Let’s stop by his office before we leave. 
Ah, Chief! 
Hey, Kohran. Heading out? 
Yep. Going on a leisurely boat ride straight to Kobe. 
It's been ages since I last saw Mr. Howard, I can't wait. 
Give him my regards. 
What kind of person is he? 
Give Mr. Howard my regards. 
Sure, leave it to me. I'm gonna tell him all about you. 
A-All about me? What kinds of stories, exactly? 
Hahaha! Who can say? 
What kind of person is this Mr. Howard? 
He taught me all sorts of stuff about machinery. 
I also picked up my Japanese from him. 
I-I see… He sounds like an impressive person. 
If you don't need anything, Chief, I'm gonna get going now. 
I see… Be careful, OK? 
All right, I gotta catch my boat, so I'm heading out. 
Take it easy, all right? 
Yeah, I will. OK, I'm off! 
Mr. Howard… Just what kind of person is he, exactly? 
Well, I should get dressed and get ready to leave, myself. 
Kohran just left, right? 
There's no use staying around here. I should go somewhere else. 
Whoops, I still haven't changed. 
I'll be meeting Orihime's parents, so I'd better dress up right. 
I wonder if Orihime's ready. 
We can't wait around too much longer, so I'll call out to her. 
The nameplate has a simple design, but it sure looks classy. 
Orihime, I'm here. 
OK, coming! 
Sorry to keep you waiting, Mr. Ensign. 
Ah, you changed your clothes? 
Wouldn't want to be rude.
How do I look? 
I figured I should, since I'm meeting your parents. Wouldn't want to be rude. 
A true gentiluomo as always. 
I'm sure Mamma will take a liking to you, too. 
Hahaha, that'd be nice. 
I thought I'd dress in something more formal… How do I look? 
It suits you perfectly well! 
You'd fit right into the high society of Europe! 
Hahaha, thanks, Orihime. 
P-Please don't stare like that, I'm getting embarrassed. 
There's nothing to be embarrassed about, Mr. Ensign. 
A man's appearance is one of his finest weapons, after all! 
I-I see… 
That reminds me, since we are to leave the theater… 
We should talk to Yoneda first, just to be safe. 
Yeah, you're right. OK then, let's stop by his office. 
There, the door is shut tight. 
Hey, Orihime. <br> Heading out already?
Ah, Mr. Ensign. 
You're going to see your mother, right? 
Yes, that's right. Mamma came to Japan all the way from Italy. 
At last… Mamma and Papa finally get to be together again!
Give them my regards. 
I'm happy for you. 
I won't be able to see them, but give them my regards, OK? 
Yes, certainly. I'll be telling Mamma all about you.
I'm happy for you, Orihime. Your parents are finally being reunited after so long.
Yes! And we have you to thank for it all, Mr. Ensign. 
I'm sorry I can't be there to see them… 
But you have a nice long chat with them, as a family. 
Mr. Ensign… <br> Thank you so much. 
I truly wish we could go together… 
I'm sorry, Orihime. I probably should go and meet them, but… 
It's OK! 
I'll tell Papa and Mamma all about you! 
Well then, Mr. Ensign, I should get going now. 
All right, be careful. <br> See you soon. 
Orihime must be so happy. Her parents are finally being reunited after over a dozen years.
Well, I should get dressed and ready to go, myself. 
Orihime just left, right? 
I should get ready to head out, too. 
Whoops, I still haven't changed. 
I ought to put on something nice for my first shrine visit of the year. 
I wonder if Reni is in her room. 
Since it's New Year's, I'll try inviting her out for a shrine visit. 
Reni… Still using notebook paper as a nameplate, I see. 
Reni, are you there? <br> It's Ogami. 
Captain? Just a second. 
Sorry to keep you waiting. 
Captain… <br> Your clothes are different. 
Yeah. I was going to invite you out to a New Year's shrine visit, so I thought I'd change my outfit. 
A shrine visit… With me? 
Yeah. It's New Year's, so why not? 
But… 
Don't worry, let's go. 
You don’t want to go? 
Don't worry, let's go. Meiji Shrine is practically next door. 
This will be your first New Year's shrine visit, right? There's all kinds of interesting things to see. 
True, I might be able to observe many customs unknown to me. 
All right then, I'll go too, sir. 
Really? Great, let's go! 
Do you not want to go, Reni? 
That's not it… 
It's New Year's, so we shouldn't shut ourselves away in the theater all day. 
All right, I see. It's true that I might be able to observe many customs unknown to me. 
Hahaha, "unknown customs," I see. That's very like you. 
OK then, Reni, let's get going. 
Are you sure you want to go with me, sir? 
What are you talking about? Of course I do. 
Why would I invite you if I didn't want to go with you? 
Captain… 
All right, Reni, let's get going. 
O-OK. 
I wonder if Reni is in her room.
…Captain. 
Hey, Reni. Did you just get back to your room? 
Yeah. Did you need something, sir? 
No, I was just wondering how you were going to spend your New Year's holiday. 
I'll be going on a New Year's shrine visit with Kaede later. 
The custom is still unknown to me. I think it'll be a positive experience. 
Have fun. 
Which shrine?
This is your first Japanese New Year, right? Have fun on your shrine visit. 
OK, I will. 
Which shrine are you going to visit? 
It's a place called Meiji Shrine. 
I see, tons of people flock there for New Year's at the start of every January. 
By the way, sir, did you need me for something? 
No, not particularly… 
I see. That's fine. 
I'll be going back to my room, then. 
Look after the place for me while I'm out, OK? 
Got it. Have a safe trip, Captain. 
So Reni's staying at the theater and going on a shrine visit, huh? 
Well, I'd better get ready to head out, then. 
Reni said she's going on a shrine visit with Kaede, right? 
I should get ready to head out, too. 
Right, I should get ready to head out. 
Yo, Ogami. <br> Long time no see. 
That voice… <br> Is that you, Kayama? 
The first of January is lovely, isn’t it, Ogami?
What a joy it is to greet the new year with you! 
You never change, do you? Is the Moon Division on break for New Year's, too? 
Indeed. However, should anything happen, we'll still deploy immediately. 
They say, "New Year's Day is the key to the year." You must steel yourself for the coming year.
I see… 
Now then, farewell, Ogami. Here's hoping we both enjoy a pleasant New Year. 
What an extravagant guy. <br> He wore a tuxedo and everything, just for a New Year's greeting. 
It's been a long time since I've worn a suit and tie like this. 
There, I should be all ready now. 
Go to Sakura's room. 
Go to Sumire's room. 
Go to Maria's room. 
Go to Kanna's room. 
Go to Iris's room. 
Go to Kohran's room. 
Go to Orihime's room. 
Grab Kinematron. 
Oops, better bring the Kinematron if I'm heading out. 
That way, if anything happens, we can get in touch with the theater right away. 
Eh, no need to bring the Kinematron. All right, let's go. 
Right, I'll go to Reni's room. 
Kaede? Are you in there? 
All right, I'm gonna go somewhere else. 
It's Ogami. Are you there, Kaede? 
… 
Huh? Is she gone? Where did she go? 
I wonder if Mr. Yoneda is in here. 
I better check another room, I guess. 
Are you there, sir? It's Ogami. 
… 
Huh? Doesn't seem like the manager's in. 
Ah, Ogami! Happy New Year! 
Hey, Tsubaki. <br> Happy New Year. 
Heehee, you came at just the right time, Ogami. 
Huh? 
You see, we have a special gift for our most loyal customers: 
A special bromide, only available on New Year's! 
I prepared these specially for you as thanks for always buying our bromides. 
All right, Ogami, you can only pick one. 
That's Sakura's special bromide. 
It's a cute photo of Sakura in her swimsuit, with a teasing smile on her face. 
All right, I'll take Sakura's. 
Here you go, Sakura's special bromide! Thank you, come again! 
That's Sumire's special bromide. 
It's a rare photo of Sumire in her role as Goneril in “King Lear.” 
All right, I'll take Sumire's. 
Here you go, Sumire's special bromide! Thank you, come again! 
That's Maria's special bromide. 
The sight of Maria in a yukata is quite titillating. 
All right, I'll take Maria's. 
Here you go, Maria's special bromide! Thank you, come again! 
That's Kanna's special bromide. 
That King Lear costume is so cool! 
All right, I'll take Kanna's. 
Here you go, Kanna's special bromide! Thank you, come again! 
That's Iris's special bromide. 
It's a really cute photo of Iris as Mytyl in "The Blue Bird." 
All right, I'll take Iris's. 
Here you go, Iris's special bromide! Thank you, come again! 
That's Kohran's special bromide. 
This is a private photo of Kohran in her work clothes. Truly one-of-a-kind! 
All right, I'll take Kohran's. 
Here you go, Kohran's special bromide! Thank you, come again! 
That's Orihime's special bromide. 
It's a photo of Orihime in her distinctively stylish swimsuit. 
All right, I'll take Orihime's. 
Here you go, Orihime's special bromide! Thank you, come again! 
That's Reni's special bromide. 
It's a photo of Reni in her role as Tyltyl in "The Blue Bird." 
All right, I'll take Reni's. 
Here you go, Reni's special bromide! Thank you, come again! 
Don't be shy, Ogami. Pick whichever bromide you'd like. 
Thanks, Tsubaki. <br> I'll cherish this bromide. 
No, I should be the one thanking you for your continued patronage. 
I'll be getting a lot of new bromides this year, so I hope you look forward to them! 
OK, I have to get back to work, so I'll be going now. 
Right. Good luck. 
Now… What to do next? 
Ah, Ogami! 
Hey, Tsubaki. Happy New Year. 
Happy New Year! Looking forward to working with you for another year! 
Huh? Not running the store today? 
That's right. The gift shop is closed for the New Year's holiday. 
I-I see. That's too bad. 
You can always buy a bromide once the holiday's over. 
Please be patient until then. 
Fair enough. All right, I'll come back after New Year’s, then. 
OK! I'll be waiting! 
Right then, what to do next? 
Hey Tsubaki. Hard at work, I see. 
Absolutely! That’s because, starting tomorrow, I'll also be on vacation.
I'm getting everything sorted now so I can start work on the right foot once we return! 
I see. Good luck. 
Ah, Mr. Ogami! Happy New Year! 
Hey, Tsubomi. Happy New Year. 
It's been a month since I started working as a waitress.
I think I'm beginning to get used to this job. 
I see. That's great. 
My resolution this year is to be less scatterbrained! 
What's your New Year's resolution, Mr. Ogami? 
Strive to safeguard peace. 
Perfect my ticket punching. 
Smile, smile! 
As captain, my resolution is to continue striving to safeguard peace in the capital.
You're always so cool, Mr. Ogami! 
I'll also try my hardest to be more like everyone in the Flower Division! 
Hmm, I'd like to perfect my ticket punching skills this year. 
The path of the ticket puncher is a long and treacherous one… 
Whaaa? There's a path for ticket punchers? That's so deep… 
OK, then I'll try to perfect my waitressing, too! 
My resolution is to do my best with a "smile, smile," just like you, Tsubomi. 
OK! I'll be working hard with a smile, smile, as well! 
Hmm… I haven't really decided yet. 
That's no good, Mr. Ogami. It's important to set goals, you know. 
You're right. I'll have to take some time to think about it. 
That would be for the best! 
Last month I burned all the food by leaving the pot on the flame… 
But this year, I'll cure myself of my scatterbrain so that I’ll never-
Ah! 
Wh-What is it? 
I forgot to light the fire this time! Aww, I really messed up! 
Hey, Tsubomi, you’re going the wrong way! The kitchen is over here!
Ah, I got mixed up! Thank you! And goodbye! 
Sheesh, some things never change… 
Sorry you had to see me like that earlier, Mr. Ogami… 
Hahaha, looks like that scatterbrain of yours got you again. 
Well no more! I absolutely won't be scatterbrained ever again! 
Haha, I see. At any rate, good luck. 
Oh, Ogami. Do you need something?
You came here to listen to my gossip, right, Ogami? 
My, you came here like clockwork, Ogami. 
If you're interested in hearing more gossip, I'm all out. Sorry. 
I see. That's too bad. 
I'll have some more interesting tidbits to share another time, so look forward to it! 
Ah, Ogami! Happy New Year! 
Here's to another year of working together. 
Happy New Year to you two as well. 
I feel completely refreshed this year! I even have a ton of new juicy gossip! 
Happy New Year, everybody. 
Oh, I was wondering who that was! It's Ichiro! 
Happy… New Year… Ogami. 
Here's to another year of working together, Ensign Ogami. 
Yeah, likewise. 
Ichiro, I got to see "The Miracle Bells," you know! 
Um… I was… deeply moved. 
It must've been quite difficult to choose the lead. 
It really was… 
Oh, speaking of choosing, there's something I wanted to ask you, Ichiro. 
So, out of us three, who would you say is more your type? 
Kotone. 
Yokihiko. 
Kikunojo. 
If I was forced to pick, then… I guess Kotone? 
Just as I expected, Ensign. You have a discerning eye. 
This beauty of mine is so potent it drives even men mad with love… 
To call it criminal wouldn't even be an exaggeration. 
Ogami… 
Hmph! You have no taste in men, Ichiro! 
If I was forced to pick, then… I guess Yokihiko? 
Ichirooo! I knew you'd say that! 
Maybe today I'll finally get my long-awaited kiss from you… 
Y-Yokihiko! 
That's enough, Yokihiko! You're scaring Ensign Ogami! 
Hmph, you're all just jealous! 
If I was forced to pick, then… I guess Kikunojo? 
Really… Ogami? 
I'm… I'm so… happy… 
Oh, Ichiro… You're too soft on Kiku. 
Perhaps Ensign Ogami is still too young to recognize my beauty… 
I… don't think I have a type… 
Oh please, Ichiro! You're so fickle! 
It seems you're still not ready to recognize my beauty. 
B-But still… I'm kind of relieved… 
U-Um, I've got things to do, so I'm gonna… 
Ogami… Are you leaving? 
Since you're here, why not spend New Year's with us? 
Oh, that's a wonderful idea! I'm gonna be keeping you up all night, Ichiro! 
Eep! I… I gotta go!! 
Phew… The New Year just started and I'm already getting into danger. 
At any rate, how do they intend to spend the New Year, anyway? 
Ah… Ogami. 
Ensign Ogami, you came back. 
OK everyone, let's make sure to grab him this time! 
Eep?! H-Help!! 
Phew… Managed to get away somehow… 
Seriously, why do I keep setting foot in that room? 
Hm? Looks like someone's taking a bath. 
I thought everyone was getting ready to go home… Who could be in there? 
Hm? What are you up to, Ogami? 
M-Mr. Yoneda! 
Ohh? Seems like someone's taking a bath. 
These clothes… They look like Kaede's. 
Huh? Did you say… Kaede?! 
I am drawn to the bath…
Go back outside. 
O-Oh, no… My body's moving on its own… I-I can't control it… 
H-Hey! Where do you think you're going, Ogami! 
It's no good! I… can't… stop! 
Phew, it's nice to take a bath first thing in the morning. 
(Kaede…) 
(…Dammit, Ogami, get back here!) 
(Hey, you're staring too, aren't you?!) 
(That's beside the point! Get outta here before she sees you!) 
Ow ow ow! I get it already, please let go of me, sir! 
N-Not so loud, dumbass! 
…!! 
Those voices… <br> Don't tell me…?! 
(C-Crap!) 
Make an excuse. 
Run away. 
Make an excuse. 
K-Kaede… Um, this was a total accident. 
S-Sorry Kaede, I tried to stop him, but… 
I don't care! Just get out! 
Y-Yes, ma'am!! 
I can't believe this happened with the manager around… 
N-No, you see… 
…No, we're sorry. Forgive us, Kaede. 
At any rate, nobody likes being peeped on in the bath. 
I want you two to think about what you've done. 
Y-Yes, ma'am! We're truly sorry. 
…Sorry, Kaede. 
… 
Hm hm, all right, I forgive you. 
Well then, I'll be going. See you later, you two. 
Thank goodness she forgave us, eh, sir? 
Yeah. She's skilled at martial arts, you know, just like Ayame was… 
So if she REALLY got mad, we would've been in big trouble. 
I-Is that so… I think I broke out in a cold sweat just hearing that. 
L-Let's get out of here, sir! 
R-Right! Hurry, Ogami! 
Phew… Looks like we made it out of there. That was close… 
You don't think she noticed us, do you, sir? 
It's fine, relax. We hightailed it out of there right away. She didn't see us. 
R-Right… 
Kaede's skilled with martial arts, you know, just like Ayame was… 
So if she REALLY got mad, we would've been in big trouble. 
I-Is that so… I think I broke out in a cold sweat just hearing that. 
Those voices… Ogami and the manager, it's you! 
Ogami! We got caught thanks to you dawdling around! 
H-Hey! That was only because you wouldn't stop pulling on me! 
Whatever! Just get out!! 
Y-Yes, ma'am!! 
I can't believe this happened with the manager around… 
N-No, you see… 
…No, we're sorry. Forgive us, Kaede. 
At any rate, nobody likes being peeped on in the bath. 
I want you two to think about what you've done. 
Y-Yes, ma'am! We're truly sorry. 
…Sorry, Kaede. 
… 
Hm hm, all right, I forgive you. 
Well then, I'll be going. See you later, you two. 
Thank goodness she forgave us, eh, sir? 
Yeah. She's skilled at martial arts, you know, just like Ayame was… 
So if she REALLY got mad, we would've been in big trouble. 
I-Is that so… I think I broke out in a cold sweat just hearing that. 
We should leave, sir. We'd be in big trouble if we peeked into the bath. 
Yes, absolutely. Let's get out of here, Ogami. 
You did pretty well to resist temptation like that. 
Right then, I'll be going. Later, Ogami. 
Hmm… That felt like a wasted opportunity… 
No, this is for the best. Right, I'd better go. 
OK, time to get out of this bath. 
Eep! This is bad, sir! 
Dammit, no choice but to run! 
Good grief… I don't think she saw us. 
We would've really been in for it if we had left even a second too late. 
Kaede's skilled with martial arts, you know, just like Ayame was… 
So if she REALLY got mad, we would've been in big trouble. 
I-Is that so… I think I broke out in a cold sweat just hearing that. 
Oh, Ogami? Are you here to take a bath? 
Um, no, not exactly… 
That reminds me, I was bathing just a moment ago… 
And I could've sworn I heard the voices of you and the manager… 
Huh?! Uh, w-well… 
Must've been my imagination. I know you'd never do anything like that. 
Hm hm, all right, I'll be going now. Take care, Ogami. 
Phew… Doesn't seem like she noticed after all. 
Right then, I should get going. 
Kaede's gone now, huh? 
Well, no use staying here. Let's go somewhere else. 
Kaede was taking a bath in here just a moment ago, right…? 
Now I feel kind of funny. I'd better leave. 
It's the New Year and everyone walking down the street looks bright and cheery. 
I'm truly glad we can enjoy a peaceful New Year. 
The theater's been on break ever since the Christmas performance. 
I hope the Flower Division's plays draw big crowds again this year. 
The Christmas play was a smashing success. 
I'm glad we were able to pull it off. 
No one's in the kitchen. 
Everyone should be in their rooms getting ready to leave right about now. 
With the Christmas play over and done with, the theater's on break for the New Year holiday. 
The entrance here will remain locked tight until the holiday's over. 
Arf, arf! 
Hey, 
! Happy New Year. 
Arf, arf, arf! 
Haha, I see you got yourself a New Year's bone, too. 
Well, there's not many of us guys here at the theater. Let's both do our best this year, all right? 
Arf! 
Arf, arf! 
I'll be heading out for a while. 
Look after the theater while I'm gone, OK? 
Guess Orihime's taking a vacation from the piano for New Year's Day. 
Well, she did say her mother was coming to visit, so I guess now's not the time for piano. 
The costumes for "The Miracle Bells" sure were incredible. 
I still can't believe we managed to put together a play like that. 
Doesn't look like anyone's in the dressing room anymore. 
Everyone must've gone back to their rooms to get ready for their trips. 
It's the New Year holiday, so rehearsals are also on hold for the time being. 
Everyone must be busy getting ready for their trips right about now. 
Standing here reminds me of the Christmas play… 
“The Miracle Bells"… I'll never forget that play for as long as I live. 
That reminds me, we even built a set for the Christmas play, huh… 
The guests seemed to like it, at least. What a relief. 
No one's in this library. 
Everyone must be busy getting ready for their trips right about now. 
Ginza's practically deserted now that it's the New Year holiday… 
All the stores are closed, and I'm sure a lot of people have left to visit their homes. 
Nobody's here. 
No point in sticking around. I'd better get dressed. 
It's empty. Nobody's around. 
No use staying here. I'd better go. 
New Year's in Japan means playing games like sugoroku or fukuwarai… 
I should get the others to play during the break, if we have time. 
The second floor seats were also packed during the Christmas play. 
The guests all seemed to like it. I'm so glad. 
No reason anyone would be up in the attic during New Year's. 
All right, let's head somewhere else. 
I can smell roses from all the way out here… 
I wonder how the Rose Division is spending their New Year's holiday? 
Thanks to Kohran, the Tenbu are fully tuned up, even now in peacetime. 
If anything were to happen, we'd be ready to deploy immediately. 
I kind of feel like I'm losing my edge, what with us not needing to deploy lately. 
Once the holiday's over, I'll come here and whip my body back into shape a little. 
I really don't like having to be here. 
I hope everyone in the Flower Division stays healthy this year. 
A cold-water swim isn't so bad in wintertime. 
No, wait, this pool's heated in the winter, isn't it? 
Who knows if we'll need to meet in the command room this year… 
I just hope this peace continues for as long as possible. 
The steam processor never stops working, even throughout the holidays. 
Still, what exactly is it processing, anyway? 
…I see. So you two'll be out for a while, then. 
Well, you've earned a nice vacation. Relax and take it easy. 
Yes, sir. 
Still, you remember what I said about keeping your romantic feelings in check, right? 
Y-Yes, sir… 
…Nah, it's fine. You guys did great work. 
You're the glue that keeps the Flower Division together. 
… 
Let me remind you two of something. 
What you feel for each other, your trust in one another… That's the source of the troupe's power.
Mr. Yoneda… 
Heading out, you two? 
Kaede… 
You forgot this, Ogami. 
Ah! The Kinematron! 
You'd better make sure to take it with you while you're out, in case of emergency. 
R-Right. Understood, ma'am. 
Be careful, and have a fun New Year's holiday. 
Y-Yes, ma'am! We're off! 
Sorry Ogami, but customers are only allowed to purchase one of each bromide. 
I see. That's too bad. 
So sorry, Mr. Ogami, but customers are only allowed to purchase one of each bromide.
Oh, really? That's too bad.

Listen to some gossip. 
I'll come back later.

Your direction was exceptional, Ogami. 
Thank you. Somehow we managed to pull it off. 
And 
Sakura

was so beautiful in the lead… 
I'd love to get up on that stage too, even if only just once… 
The commotion caused by the attempted coup d’etat last year has finally faded away. 
Yeah, people have already stopped talking about the Taisho Restoration Army. 
It's the New Year, so maybe everyone wants to just forget about the depressing news from last year? 
Yeah, that must be it. 
Have you already had the chance to visit a shrine for the New Year's, Ogami? 
Um, sure… <br> Are you two going?
Yes, we thought we'd go with Kaede later… 
But Kaede seems so busy already, we don't know if she'll have the time. 
I see. I hope you all get to go together. 
Last year was quite hectic, wasn't it, Ogami? So much happened. 
Yeah, and it all happened right after I returned to the theater.
Orihime and Reni have fully taken to being part of the Flower Division. 
It's all thanks to your efforts, Ogami. 
N-No, that's not true… 
I hope these peaceful days can last forever. 
Yep. If they don't, then we won't be able to go out to eat! 
Did you see today's newspaper, Ogami? 
No, not yet. Any interesting articles? 
Yes, there was a special feature for New Year's, titled "The Capital of the Future." 
According to the article, in the near future, everyone will have their own steam automobiles… 
And every household will be equipped with steam telephones. 
Wow, really? 
Well, the article's just speculation. 
Heehee, there'd be daily flights to America or England… 
And television devices like Kohran's Kinematron would be commonplace. 
Hahaha, that all sounds like the far future to me. 
Is it true that residential applications for those apartments in Mukojima have opened up? 
Yes, and even though they won't be available for six months, there's already a rush of applicants. 
Huh, these apartments must be pretty popular. 
They are the first western-style apartments in Japan, after all. 
Western-style? 
That's right. I think they also call them "flats." 
They're basically a bunch of rooms lined up next to each other, several stories tall… 
Hmm… I don't really know how to describe them. 
They're in Mukojima, right? I'll go take a look sometime. 
The Meiji Literature Collection has started publication as of last year, you know. 
Mr. Yoneda has arranged it so our library always has the newest volume, but they're too much for me.
The print's way too small and I don't understand all the words… 
Really? I find many of them quite fascinating. 
I'll just stick with Harold Lloyd and Buster Keaton pictures, thanks. 
That reminds me, Ogami. New Year's Eve was pretty hectic, wasn't it? 
Yeah, we were really busy cleaning up and getting ready for the New Year. 
I still can't believe Kanna ate 50 bowls of toshikoshi soba. 
And Orihime caused quite a scene when she looked at the soba and said, "This pasta's gone bad!" 
What a lively way to end the year. 
Sorry, Ogami, but I'm all out of gossip for now. 
I'll have some more interesting tidbits to share another time, so look forward to it!
All right, I'll come back later. Best of luck this year, you two. 
Thank you very much. 
I'll get you all kinds of juicy gossip this year!
