Finally… The time has come. 
With the Pandemonium Regalia gone, there are none left who can oppose me. 
Tsuchigumo! 
Sir! 
Kongou! 
Yessir! 
And… Demon King. 
…Yes, my lord. 
At long last, the day has arrived for the capital to kneel at my feet. 
To kneel before… Kyogoku. 
Yes, sir… 
Demon King… <br> I trust that our vanguard is ready to deploy? 
Of course. Right this way… 
During the Kouma War, the Army gathered Kouma corpses in total secrecy… 
By extracting the spirit power from their tissue, their bodies were rebuilt into the ultimate weapons.
“Kouma Weapons"… <br> Finally, the day has come for you to trample the capital beneath your might. 
GRAAAAWL! 
Kongou… Tsuchigumo… <br> I leave the Imperial Assault Troupe to you. 
Those vermin are certain to appear. I expect you to make up for your failures at Akasaka. 
Yessir! Even if it costs me my life! 
I'll bury the Imperial Assault Troupe with my own hands! 
Now go! To the site of the final seal… To Ouji! 
The time has come to activate the Octagram of Demonic Calling! 
The time… for Musashi's return!! 
Yes, my lord! 
Hmmm… 
*yawn*… <br> Morning already? 
…Hm? <br> Something smells good… 
Sakura, grab the sweet sake and soy sauce, would you? 
Yes, Mother. 
Are they making breakfast? They sound really happy… 
Wake up now. 
Sleep in a bit longer. 
OK, time to get up. I can't keep sleeping forever. 
Oh, Ogami. <br> Good morning. 
Good morning. Did you sleep well last night? 
Good morning. I slept like a log thanks to your hospitality. 
Breakfast is almost ready, so wait just a little longer. 
Thanks. I'll go get changed, then. 
*yawn*… <br> I'm still drowsy. I'll sleep in just a bit longer… 
Wake up, Ogami, it's morning. 
Good morning, Sakura. 
Just 5 more minutes… 
Ah, good morning, Sakura. 
Good morning. <br> Did you sleep well? 
Yeah, I slept like a log thanks to your hospitality.
Really? Hmhm, glad to hear it. 
We finished making breakfast, so get changed and come to the living room, OK? 
Breakfast at Sakura's, huh? 
Just 5 more minutes… 
Oh, Ogami, you're hopeless. 
We finished making breakfast, so get changed and come to the living room, OK? 
If you don’t hurry, your miso soup will get cold. 
C-Crap, my breakfast is gonna get cold! 
I gotta get changed, quick! 
… 
Heehee, Ogami's fast asleep… 
… 
Wake up, dear… <br> It's morning… 
Huh?! S-Sakura… 
Eek! O-Ogami… Were you awake this whole time?! 
Oh, jeez… Hurry and get up already! It's time for breakfast! 
S-Sakura… 
OK, let's eat.
There's plenty to go around, so eat as much as you'd like! 
Sakura made this breakfast almost entirely by herself. 
Hmhm, I tried to make it just like Mother's! 
*chew* *chew*…  
Well, Ogami…? <br> How does it taste? 
It's great! 
Um… It's OK. 
It's great! This is delicious, Sakura! 
Really? Thank you so much! 
You've gotten quite good at seasoning, haven't you, Sakura? 
Thanks! I practiced to make it taste just like your recipes, Mother!  
Though, I do think the miso soup could stand to be a bit lighter. 
Huh, you think so? <br> …In that case, you'll have to teach me how sometime! 
(So this is the taste of a family, huh?) 
(This must be how a flavor gets passed down to future generations…) 
Um… It's OK. 
I-Is that right…?
I think the miso soup should've been a bit lighter. 
I'll teach you the trick to making it later. 
Your father was always so fussy about his miso soup… 
Wow… You absolutely have to tell me! 
I want to cook just like you… The way Father liked it! 
(So this is the taste of a family, huh?) 
(This must be how a flavor gets passed down to future generations…) 
Hmm… I dunno if I like it or not… 
Come on, Ogami, which one is it? 
Thanks for the meal. 
It was nothing. 
Sakura, when you have a minute, go visit your father's grave, will you? 
…Huh? <br> But Mother… 
Please, take care. 
…OK! Well then, Ogami, let's go right away. 
We're here, Ogami. This is my father's grave. 
W-Whoa… There's a tomb in this rock! 
Ogami… The truth is… 
Nobody outside of the Shinguji family has ever been allowed to see the Shinguji family tomb. 
Huh?! Then… does that mean that I'm…? 
…O-Ogami, how about we head inside now. 
Y-Yeah, sure. 
Father, it's Sakura. I'm finally back home. 
The captain of the Imperial Assault Troupe's Flower Division, Ichiro Ogami, is with me today. 
… 
Father. We… 
We're carrying out your final wish and fighting with all we have to protect peace in the capital. 
So please, keep watching over us… Over the Imperial Assault Troupe. 
… 
…All right, Ogami. Let us depart. 
…OK. 
…! 
That noise… Is that the Kinematron ringing?! 
Ogami, we should answer it right away! 
Ogami? Thank goodness, I finally got through. 
Kaede! What on earth is going on?! 
We have an emergency. Hostiles have been sighted in Ouji! 
Wha… <br> What did you just say?! 
We still don't know all the details. The rest of the Flower Division have already deployed. 
The Soaring Whale is en route to your location. Return here ASAP! 
Get back to the theater immediately, you two! 
Roger, ma'am! 
Sakura! We've got hostiles! 
Y-Yes, sir! 
The Soaring Whale's coming to get us. We're headed back to the capital! 
Ogami… <br> I heard everything. 
Mother! 
Please, look after Sakura, Ogami. 
I'm sorry, Mother! I wanted to stay here longer, but… 
Getting to see you happy and healthy was more than enough for me. Now, go! 
I'll be praying for your success, Ogami. 
…Yes, ma'am. 
I'll be going, then, Mother… 
You mustn't die on me.
I swear, she'll come back.
We'll drop by again. 
I swear, she'll come back alive… I promise.
Ogami… 
We'll drop by again sometime, and when we do, we'll stay even longer. 
All right. I'll be waiting for your return. 
Mother… 
I'll teach you how to make miso soup then, Sakura. 
…OK! 
I'll be all right, Mother. With Ogami at my side, I can give it my all! 
That sound… <br> It's the Soaring Whale! 
We're going now, Mother! 
Come back safely, Sakura. 
Ogami, look after my daughter. 
…Yes, ma'am! 
Phew… My stomach's finally settled. 
Speaking of which, Sumire's still not back yet… 
Oh, Master Ogami. <br> Are you alone? 
Yeah. Do you know where Sumire's gone? 
Now that you mention it, she just left for a walk with Mistress Hinako. 
I see… 
Go look for them. 
Stay where you are. 
OK, I'll go look for them. 
I believe they went out to the yard. 
The yard, huh? Thank you, Miyata. 
I'm sure Sumire and her mother have a lot to talk about. I'll leave them be. 
Well then, Master Ogami, perhaps you might enjoy an after-meal stroll in the yard in the meantime? 
I see, that does sound nice. 
All right, I'll wander around a little, then. 
Very good, sir. I'll let you know once the young mistress has returned. 
In the meantime, perhaps you might enjoy an after-meal stroll in the yard, Master Ogami? 
Once the young mistress has returned, I'll let you know right away. 
I see, that does sound nice. 
All right, I'll follow your suggestion and go wander around a little. 
Phew, looking for Sumire in such a huge yard sure is a hassle. 
At any rate, I wonder what those two are talking about. 
Ah, what great weather. Not a cloud in the sky. 
But boy, it feels like you could easily get lost in a yard as huge as this. 
Sumire… I have something I wanted to tell you. 
…! 
Could that voice be…? 
(I knew it, it's Sumire and Hinako.) 
…What is it, Mother? 
I wanted to apologize for the arranged marriage. 
We should have stopped your grandfather. 
… 
I know you must feel bitter towards him… 
Oh, I'm not bitter. I'm furious! 
Not only did he lie about being sick, he tried to force me into an arranged marriage! 
He can be quite overbearing, but that's how the Kanzaki family got to where it is today. 
You and your grandfather are quite alike, so… 
So what, Mother?! You want me to take over the Kanzaki family, is that it? 
I refuse! I'm a member of the Imperial Assault Troupe now! 
Sumire… 
… 
Do as you wish. You're still young, after all. 
But you just recently received those new Spirit Armors, the Tenbu, didn't you? 
Their development was very expensive, and the one who backed it… was your grandfather. 
…! 
Sumire… <br> Love takes many forms. 
It can be clumsy, overbearing, or cold… 
But accepting that is also its own form of love. 
Your father, your grandfather… And myself, of course… 
We all truly love you. 
Mother… 
(…) 
I see… <br> So the Tenbu were financed by the Kanzaki Group… 
Oh, Master Ogami! <br> There you are! 
What's the matter, Miyata? 
There's a strange beeping noise coming from Mistress Sumire's room. 
Beeping noise? 
The Kinematron! 
The alarm clock? 
Oh, right! That must be the Kinematron ringing! 
The kinema… What now? 
It's, well, did you see a strangely shaped device in there? 
Yes, yes I did! I brought it out to the entrance for the time being. 
A beeping noise from Sumire’s room? That must be an alarm clock then, right? 
P-Preposterous! There's no need for an alarm clock to be as boisterous as this thing! 
It's a strange little contraption making all that racket. 
Wait, what?! Then that beeping might be… the Kinematron! 
For the time being, I brought it out to the entrance. 
Let's see, was there anything in Sumire’s room that you think could be making that sound? 
Well, the noise seems to be coming from some strange contraption.
Wait, what?! Then that beeping might be… the Kinematron! 
For the time being, I brought it out to the entrance. 
I see, thank you! 
Miyata, go get Sumire! She should still be in the yard! 
Yes, sir! Understood! 
So it was the Kinematron after all! 
But then… <br> What on earth is going on?! 
Ensign! 
Miyata told me everything. We're receiving a call on the Kinematron, am I right? 
We must answer it immediately! 
Yeah. OK, I'm picking up… 
Ogami? Thank goodness, I finally got through. 
Kaede! What on earth is going on?! 
We have an emergency. Hostiles have been sighted in Ouji! 
Wha… <br> What did you just say?! 
We still don't know all the details. The rest of the Flower Division have already deployed. 
The Soaring Whale is en route to your location. Return here ASAP! 
Get back to the theater immediately, you two! 
Roger, ma'am! 
There's no time to dawdle about, Ensign. 
Yeah. We have to get to Ouji, fast! 
… 
Sumire… Go and live your life to the fullest. 
…I will. 
S-Sumire… <br> When will you come by to visit again? We should have a party when you do. 
A party just for you. We'll hire chefs from around the world, and then… Uhh… 
I'll buy you all the things you want… And then… Sumire… We love you. 
Father… 
Ogami… Please, take care of Sumire. 
Yes, ma'am! 
We'll stop by again. 
Yes, ma'am! I swear to protect Sumire! 
Ensign… 
Ogami… <br> Thank you very much. 
Sumire and I will stop by again sometime. 
Right, Sumire? 
…Yes. We'll come back… if I feel like it. 
You can come whenever you like. You're always welcome here. 
I'll be all right, Mother. 
With the ensign by my side, I have nothing to fear. 
Sumire… 
Father, Mother… I'm going. 
Be safe. Come visit us again sometime. 
Sumire, um… Maybe you can treat us to some of your cooking next time? 
…Of course, I will. Look forward to it. 
Mother… Give Grandfather my regards. 
…Yes, I understand. I'll be sure to tell him. 
Let us be off, Ensign! It's time for our grand entrance! 
Yeah, let's go, Sumire! 
… 
Ogami… Please, protect my dear Sumire. 
The smell of the ocean sure takes me back. Reminds me of my time in the Naval Academy. 
Oh, looks like one of the ships is just about to leave port. 
Judging by its size, I'm guessing it's headed abroad. 
… 
Maria? What's the matter? 
… 
I was just… thinking about my time in Russia. 
About why… I abandoned Russia and ran away to America. 
Was I tired of all the fighting and poverty? Did I yearn for personal freedom? 
Even now… I'm not really sure. 
… 
But nevertheless, I did run away… From myself as well. Now I'm but a wanderer. 
*sigh*… <br> Sometimes I hate how weak I can be… I have to be stronger. 
Not just for myself, but for the Flower Division as well… Right, Captain? 
(Maria…) 
Say something to Maria. 
Maria… 
… 
Captain… <br> Do you mind if I cry…? 
N-Not at all… 
… 
… 
(Maria…) 
(Maria…) 
Moya rodina… <br> (My motherland…) 
… 
…! <br> Is that the Kinematron ringing?! 
…Captain. 
Yeah, seems like we're receiving a transmission. 
What could it be? 
Ogami? Thank goodness, I finally got through. 
Kaede! What on earth is going on?! 
We have an emergency. Hostiles have been sighted in Ouji! 
Wha… <br> What did you just say?! 
We still don't know all the details. The rest of the Flower Division have already deployed. 
The Soaring Whale is en route to your location. Return here ASAP! 
Get back to the theater immediately, you two! 
Roger, ma'am! 
Looks like we've got a situation on our hands, Captain. 
Yeah, I'm still not sure what's going on, but we have to get back, and fast. 
… 
The fighting's starting once again. 
Maria… 
Gently cheer her up. 
Boldly cheer her up. 
I know it won't replace your family or your homeland, Maria… 
But I'm here to support you. 
…Yes, Captain. 
I'll always be at your side, Maria. 
If there's anything burdening you… 
Then maybe I can help relieve some of it for you. 
Captain… Thank you. 
You don't have to say anything, Maria. 
I'll always be there at your side. 
Captain… 
There's something I've learned since I joined the Imperial Assault Troupe. 
To live means to experience loss… 
But it's because I'm alive that I get to meet so many new people. 
Yeah, and thanks to that, our paths were able to cross.
That's why we're coming back from this alive, Maria! 
We'll make sure everyone knows the joy of peace! 
Yes, Captain! 
All right, let's go! To protect our capital… and our Flower Division! 
U… Uh… 
…Huh? <br> Guess I must've dozed off. 
Right, we were having a drink-off in front of the tomb… 
And I passed out as soon as we got back to Kanna's house. 
Huh? Kanna's not here. 
Go look for her. 
I'm worried about Kanna… All right, I'll go look for her. 
Eh, this is Kanna we're talking about, she'll be fine. 
… 
… … 
Nope, too worried to sleep after all. 
Well, I'm wide awake, so I might as well go for a walk and look for her. 
She's not anywhere around the house… 
That means the only place left would be near the tomb. 
Dad… 
(So Kanna was here all along…) 
Dad… Why'd you have to go and die like that? There's so much more I wanted to learn from you… 
Dumbass… 
(…) 
Dad… I'll become an Unaigami. 
I wasn't able to be yours, but the boss… 
I'll be his Unaigami, you'll see… 
(Kanna…) 
Hey, Dad, listen to this. I got to play a female role. The lead role, no less. 
Because my boss… He chose me. 
At first, I had no idea how it was gonna turn out… 
But he and I both gave it all we got, and the crowd loved it. 
(…) 
It's too bad you aren't able to see any of my plays… 
But he and I will keep doin' our best. 
… 
Inago ikusa nu sachiba… <br> (In battle, the woman leads the charge…) 
(Kanna…) 
…Boss. 
…Hm? 
C'mon, it's mornin’. Wake up, Boss. 
Uh… Kanna? 
You musta been exhausted. You were sleepin' like a baby. 
Kanna… 
Hm? What's up, Boss? 
About last night… 
…No, it's nothing. 
About last night… Did you go to the tomb? 
You mean to my dad's grave? 
Yeah, I saw you there last night. 
Hahahaha! Maybe in your dreams, you did. 
You did drink quite a bit last night, so that makes sense. 
Hmmm… Was it really just a dream? 
C'mon, forget all this dream talk, let's grab breakfast. 
R-Right… 
…No, it's nothing. 
What's with you, Boss? I'm gettin' a little concerned, now. 
Don't worry about it, Kanna. It's nothing, really. 
But more importantly, is it time for breakfast yet? 
Yeah, it's all ready. Ya ready to chow down? 
Was that just… a dream? 
Hey, Boss, you still half-asleep? 
C'mon, go wash up. Breakfast is ready. 
R-Right… 
…Hm? 
That sound… <br> No way! 
It's the Kinematron! It's ringing! 
All the way out here? What the hell's goin' on?! 
No clue. Let's answer it and see. 
Ogami? Thank goodness, I finally got through. 
Kaede! What on earth is going on?! 
We have an emergency. Hostiles have been sighted in Ouji! 
Wha… <br> What did you just say?! 
We still don't know all the details. The rest of the Flower Division have already deployed. 
The Soaring Whale is en route to your location. Return here ASAP! 
Get back to the theater immediately, you two! 
Roger, ma'am! 
Boss… Sounds like somethin’ big’s goin’ down. 
Yeah. Time to get back into action, Kanna. 
I'll be all right. As long as we're together, Boss, I'm not afraid of anything. 
As long as we're together, we're not losin' to anybody! 
Kanna… 
We'll always be together.
We should come back again.
Kanna, I know you've been alone ever since your father died… 
But no more. From now on, we'll always be together! 
Boss… Thanks! 
We should come back sometime, Kanna. 
I want to drink more awamori and eat more Okinawan food… 
Plus, I'd like to get a chance to talk to your dad some more. 
…Yeah! <br> We'll definitely come back! <br>We’ll come back together! 
Kanna… We don't have to say a thing to each other. 
Yeah, you're right. 
No matter who we're up against, we're not gonna lose! 
We'll protect our friends! That's what the Imperial Assault Troupe fights for! 
Zzz… Zzz… 
Looks like Iris is sound asleep. 
She probably tired herself out from all that romping around. 
At any rate, that girl's grown to be so cheerful. 
Yes, indeed. 
Ogami. You know about her power, don't you? 
…I do. 
We noticed that power soon after she was born. 
We were overcome with worry, and so, we kept her away from the outside world. 
We thought the outside world would be… too harsh on her. 
… 
But we were mistaken. Iris wasn't some bird meant to be locked in a cage. 
Seeing her smiling face today, I know that now. 
I know that Iris is as happy as can be with you and the others in the Flower Division. 
We want nothing more than to live with Iris, from the bottom of our hearts. 
But what Iris needs now… is you. All of you. 
Iris is our precious treasure. So please, Ogami… Look after her. 
I'll protect Iris. 
Come visit again. 
Yes, sir. No matter what happens, I will protect Iris. 
Thank you… 
We believe in you, Ogami. 
Come visit again whenever you like. 
That way you can see Iris grow up, little by little. 
Ogami… Thank you so much. 
We'll definitely come back… Definitely. 
Iris… 
Uhhh… Mm… 
Ah… <br> Was I… asleep? 
Oh my. Sorry for waking you up, Iris. 
I heard Mon Frère's voice and woke up. 
Hahaha, like Sleeping Beauty awoken by the prince's kiss. 
Huh? What did you say? Did Mon Frère… kiss me? 
…Wha? 
Hm hm hm… Maybe when you're a little older, Iris. 
N-Not you too… 
Huh? Is that an alarm clock I'm hearing? 
No, that’s not it. It's the Kinematron ringing! 
What could've possibly happened? All right, let me take it out. 
Ogami? Thank goodness, I finally got through. 
Kaede! What on earth is going on?! 
We have an emergency. Hostiles have been sighted in Ouji! 
Wha… <br> What did you just say?! 
We still don't know all the details. The rest of the Flower Division have already deployed. 
The Soaring Whale is en route to your location. Return here ASAP! 
Get back to the theater immediately, you two! 
Roger, ma'am! 
Iris… We have to go. 
…Yeah. 
I see… That's too bad. I was hoping we'd get to talk a while longer. 
We'll escort you outside, dear. 
Papa… Mama… <br> I'm going. 
OK… <br> Come back safely. 
Please… <br> Be careful. 
… 
Iris? What's wrong? 
… 
Iris… You're feeling lonely, aren't you? 
Why don't you say goodbye to them, just one more time? 
But… 
Speak kindly to her. 
Be tactful. 
Iris… Go see them. 
Your papa and mama want to be with you. 
But… They have to stay behind while you head to battle. 
So that's why you need to tell them, "I'm coming back." 
Really? Is that OK? 
Yeah. Go to them. 
OK! Thank you, Mon Frère! 
I'm… starting to feel a little seasick. 
…Huh? <br> Are you OK, Mon Frère? 
Yeah, I'll be fine. It'll blow over eventually. 
So… Why don't you go talk to your parents until I feel better? 
Mon Frère… 
Thanks, Mon Frère. I'll be right back! 
Please, Mon Frère… Can I talk to my papa and mama one more time? 
…Yeah, sure. Go ahead. 
OK! Thank you, Mon Frère! 
Papaaa! Mamaaa! 
Iris! 
Iris! 
I promise… <br> I'm coming back! 
I'll be back for you, Papa, and you, Mama! 
Iris… <br> Thank you. 
Iris… Your papa and mama will wait for you as long as it takes! 
OK! 
All right, Papa, Mama… <br> I'll be baaaack!! 
By the way, you're the one who formally taught Kohran mechanics, right, Mr. Howard? 
That's right! She's probably better than me at this point, though. 
What are you saying, Howard? I'm still only learning. 
Besides, you'll always be my teacher, no matter how much time passes. 
Oh, that's right! I still have a bunch of Kohran's inventions from way back! 
Wanna see 'em, Ogami? 
Absolutely, please! 
I'm not interested. 
They won't blow up, right? 
Absolutely, please! 
You still got all that stuff, Pops? 
Of course I do! I've been taking good care of them all this time! 
Right then, follow me, you two! 
I'm not particularly interested, so I'll pass. 
You're being a real downer, Chief. 
All right then, maybe you can come take a look by yourself? 
Yeah, I'd love to! I haven't seen my old inventions in ages! 
Ah… They left. 
Oh well, guess I should go check it out too. 
Those inventions won't blow up… Right? 
You've got nothin' to fear! They're all properly powered down! 
All right, Chief, let's go see 'em right away. 
Hmm, what to do… 
Quit fussing, Chief. C'mon, let's go! 
Right then, follow me, you two! 
Wowee… So many nostalgic inventions! 
Go ahead, Ogami, take a gander! 
All right, let's have a look. 
That's a steam gramophone. It lets you listen to records using steam power. 
Wow, that seems useful. 
One problem, though. The needle doesn't sit still, thanks to the steam motor's vibrations. 
The concept was sound, but it wasn't practical in the end. 
I see… A gramophone. 
If I could get the vibration problem solved, it'd totally work, though. 
That's a steam-powered pressure cooker! 
It was one of the rare inventions of mine from this period that was actually a success.
Wow. What can you make with it? 
You can cook rice, steam potatoes… 
You can make all sortsa stuff! It's a multipurpose cooking machine! 
(A cooking machine, huh? Guess even Kohran makes some practical inventions from time to time.) 
That's the steam cleaner. It's a machine that runs around and picks up garbage fully automatically! 
Wow, that's amazing. So why didn't it work out? 
Hmmm… Well, it ran around a little TOO fast. 
Once you started it up, you’d never be able to catch it again… 
Not only that, but time after time it mistook my important documents as garbage. 
Hahaha, that's unfortunate. 
Still, this could work if you refined it, don't you think? 
Yeah, you're right. I'll try making it again once we get back to the theater. 
This is a steam camera. It takes full-colored photographs… 
But it's so heavy, it's exhausting to carry around. 
And Kohran always had me carry it for her. That camera's the cause of so much suffering. 
It's not so bad, Howard. You got to take pictures AND exercise! You killed two birds with one stone! 
In the end, this invention served as the model for the Koubu's camera scope. 
Is that so? I guess all that work didn't go to waste, then. 
This here's a steam clock. Steam power makes the hands move when you wind it up. 
The steam whistle makes for a good alarm, but… 
It was so loud, it shattered all the glass in the house. 
It's more likely to make you pass out than wake up! Hahahaha! 
Boy, it caused quite the commotion the first time we used it. 
This here's a steam-powered mosquito coil. 
A charming device that integrates a Japanese pig-shaped mosquito coil holder with steam power. 
Wow… What a fascinating invention. 
However, there was a problem with the steam power used to run it. 
It repelled mosquitoes well enough, but it was so hot and noisy, it actually made it HARDER to sleep. 
Hahaha, putting the cart before the horse, eh? 
Man, that takes me back. I made all kindsa stuff, didn't I… 
This here's a steam-powered transceiver. Guess you could call it the prototype for the Kinematron. 
I wasn't able to get the screens working in the end, so I had to shelve it. 
There was a lot leading up to the Kinematron, huh? 
(I guess even inventions can be long-term endeavors sometimes.) 
(Kohran looks so happy, her eyes are practically twinkling.) 
(She truly loves machines, from the bottom of her heart.) 
Stop looking at ME, Chief, look at my inventions! 
Where are you going, Chief? Check out my inventions while you're here! 
As you can see, I made all kindsa stuff. 
You've really loved machines for a long time, haven't you? 
Yeah. I'd get caught up building these and stay up all night. 
In the end, most of them were total failures… 
But it's thanks to all that passion and all those failures that I am who I am today. 
Kohran… 
Hey, Kohran, I brought ya somethin' nice. 
Wow… <br> Now this brings me back. 
What's that watch? 
It's the pocket watch Kohran keeps as a memento of her father. 
She asked me to take very good care of it. 
This is where my love for messing with machines began. 
This watch is real important to me. 
It's the watch that saved my life, after all. 
The watch… saved your life? 
Yep. Back when my village was attacked by bandits… 
I was shot at by a rifle, but the watch took the bullet instead. It saved me… 
Your father protected you.
What a crazy coincidence. 
It must've been your father protecting you. 
…Yeah. I think so, too. 
Wow… What a crazy coincidence. 
Heheh, well, I guess you could call it a coincidence. 
But I like to think it was my dad trying to protect me. 
Sorry for getting so serious outta nowhere. 
When I moved to the theater, I left it here with the rest of my inventions. 
I wanted to start fresh, from square one. 
But all my inventing started here, with this little watch. 
Kohran… 
Oh yeah, Pops, lemme show you the Kinematron. 
Oh, that's the communicator you wrote about in your letters, right? I absolutely must see it! 
Here you go, Kohran, the Kinematron. 
Thanks a bunch. Now, this beauty lets you talk to people while being able to look at their faces. 
Once you receive a transmission, it'll start ringing… 
Whoa! <br> Th-That scared me! 
The Kinematron's getting a call! 
What the heck could it be? Let's answer it, quick! 
Ogami? Thank goodness, I finally got through. 
Kaede! What on earth is going on?! 
We have an emergency. Hostiles have been sighted in Ouji! 
Wha… <br> What did you just say?! 
We still don't know all the details. The rest of the Flower Division have already deployed. 
The Soaring Whale is en route to your location. Return here ASAP! 
Get back to the theater immediately, you two! 
Roger, ma'am! 
Sounds like a real mess, Chief. 
Yeah. We have to get back to the capital, pronto. 
Hey, Pops… I was hoping to stick around a bit longer, but… 
I gotta go back. I'm real sorry. 
Kohran… 
…Ya better not die. <br> Ya gotta keep living. 
Keep living so that you can keep making all kindsa new things. 
Making people happy with the things you make… 
Is the greatest joy an inventor can know. 
Howard… 
Howard, Chief, I'm gonna go for it! 
Coming here today helped me remember where I came from. 
I'm gonna keep on making all sorts of great stuff! 
That's why I'm not gonna lose… I CAN'T lose! 
Kohran… 
All right, let's go! 
I'll protect you, Kohran! 
All right, let's go! <br> To protect the capital… <br> To protect the Flower Division! 
And to protect our future! 
Yeah! Let's do this, Chief! 
I swear I'll protect you, Kohran! 
That way you can keep on inventing all sorts of new creations from here on out! 
Chief… Thanks a bunch! With you around, I'm not scared of nothin'! 
There's nothing left to say, Kohran. 
We're gonna win this fight and go home, just like we always do! 
Yeah! Let's do this, Chief! 
No matter who we're up against, we'll never lose! That's what the Imperial Assault Troupe's all about! 
Both of you, I must apologize. You left the room out of consideration for us, didn't you?
No, it's fine. I just needed to talk to Mr. Ensign about something. 
By the way, Ogami. Do you remember the promise you made? 
Yes, I remember. 
What promise? 
Yes, I remember. 
I believe Orihime and I promised to model for one of your portraits together, am I right?
Yes, that's the one. I'm glad you remembered. 
What promise? Do you know what he's talking about, Orihime? 
You have forgotten already?! We promised to model for one of his portraits, didn’t we?! 
Oh, that's right! I remember now. 
Mamma mia! You shouldn't forget such an important promise! 
Now, now, Orihime, it WAS over a month ago. It's perfectly understandable. 
Hmmm… I'm not sure if I do remember it or not… 
Seriously, Mr. Ensign, you have nessuna memoria, no memory at all! 
We promised to model for one of his portraits, remember?! 
Oh yeah, that's right! I finally remembered. 
You shouldn't forget such an important promise! 
Now, now, Orihime, it WAS over a month ago. It's perfectly understandable. 
I'll ask you again, Ogami. 
Would you and Orihime model for me? 
Yes, with pleasure. 
I… can't. 
Yes, with pleasure. 
…Do we have to be nude? 
I… can't. 
Yes, with pleasure. 
I am fine with it, of course! 
Thanks, you two. 
I… can't do it. I don't have what it takes. 
No, that's not true. You and Orihime have a certain… radiance about you. 
…Radiance? 
When a person's accomplished something, they shine brightly. 
Seeing you two now… I want to capture that radiance in my art. 
Please, Ogami. 
After all of that, how can you say no, Mr. Ensign? 
…All right, I get it, Orihime. 
Mr. Ogata, I'd be more than happy to model for you. 
Oh, so you'll do it, then? Thank you. 
When you say "modeling"… Does that mean we have to be nude? 
M-Mr. Ensign! What are you saying?! 
There's no way we could do that in a public place such as this, with all these strangers to gawk at us!
T-That’s true. You make a good point. 
Hahaha… You're as entertaining as ever, Ogami. 
Do not worry, you can stay dressed just the way you are.
Hmmm… What should I do? 
You have no reason for hesitating, Mr. Ensign!
You and I are perfectly qualified to be models! 
Wow, Orihime… <br> That's some confidence. 
All right then, Orihime, if you could sit in that chair over there. 
Ogami, you stand next to the chair. 
OK, got it. 
Good, Orihime, let's go with that expression. 
Now, what expression should I have you do, Ogami… 
(An expression, huh?) 
Look natural. 
Flash a toothy smile. 
Give a gallant expression. 
Look natural. 
Flash a toothy smile. 
Smile with your whole face. 
(Maybe I should just stick with a natural expression?) 
That face will do just fine, Ogami. 
Yes, you look your best with your usual, natural expression. Wouldn't you agree, Carino? 
Indeed, I think it perfectly conveys his personality. 
(I should probably smile, right?) 
Hmm… That smile seems a bit forced. 
I… I see… 
I believe it would be best to display your everyday countenance, simply act natural. 
…Like this? 
Yes, that's it! It perfectly conveys your sincere personality. 
(Maybe an expression like this, befitting the captain of the Flower Division!) 
O-Ogami… That expression's a bit much. 
R-Really? Did I overdo it? 
What if instead you simply displayed your everyday, natural countenance? 
…Like this? 
Yes, that's it! It perfectly conveys your sincere personality. 
(All right, might as well smile with my whole face, then.) 
H-How's this? 
O-Ogami… <br> Your face is twitching. 
Oh, s-sorry. I thought I'd try smiling… 
What if instead you simply displayed your everyday, natural countenance? 
…Like this? 
Yes, that's it! It perfectly conveys your sincere personality. 
(Hmm… What kind of expression should I go with?) 
That face will do just fine, Ogami. 
Yes, it perfectly conveys his natural charm. 
I… I see… 
All right, we'll go with this. Now then, you two, stay just like that. 
OK, got it. 
Papa! Draw me extra beautiful, OK? 
Mr. Ensign… 
Hm? What is it? 
Modeling for one of Papa's pictures with you like this… 
It feels so… enigmatic. 
… 
Enigmatic? Why are you talking like that, Orihime? 
I… I was just thinking… <br> I want to be more like Mamma… 
Someone who can shine in front of the people I love, like she does. 
So I thought I’d try to use prettier words… more eloquent prose around you, Mr. Ensign. 
Orihime… 
The way you talk is fine.
That makes me happy. 
I appreciate it, but the way you normally talk is fine the way it is. 
I'll admit, I was pretty surprised by it at first… 
But I'm totally used to it now. The way you normally talk suits you better, Orihime. 
Mr. Ensign… 
You don't have to try so hard for my sake. Just be yourself. 
Mr. Ensign… <br> Thank you so much! 
Thank you, that makes me happy. 
Hm hm, if you're happy, then I'm happy… I mean, I am jubilant as well. 
Don't wear yourself out over it, though, OK? 
Non preoccupatevi! <br> I mean, relaaaax! <br> No, wait, I mean… 
Orihime… You really don't have to go that far. 
I like you just the way you always are. 
R-Really? Thank you. 
Mr. Ensign… <br> You don't like it? 
W-Well, it's just… kind of weird. 
Hmph! You have no understanding of women, Mr. Ensign! 
Well fine! I'll go back to my usual way of talking. 
All right, that'll do for now. 
Great work, the both of you. You were magnificent. 
Really? Heehee, I can't wait for the finished piece! 
Today was just the sketch. I still need to color it, refine it… There's still a ways to go. 
Huh? But I want to see it now! 
Hahaha, come on, Orihime, we can wait and have something to look forward to. 
…! 
Oh my, what is that commotion?
Mr. Ensign! Could that be…? 
Yeah. That's the Kinematron ringing. 
Let's bring it out and see what's up! 
Ogami? Thank goodness, I finally got through. 
Kaede! What on earth is going on?! 
We have an emergency. Hostiles have been sighted in Ouji! 
Wha… <br> What did you just say?! 
We still don't know all the details. The rest of the Flower Division have already deployed. 
The Soaring Whale is en route to your location. Return here ASAP! 
Get back to the theater immediately, you two! 
Roger, ma'am! 
Mr. Ensign, we have to go, quickly! 
I don't know who these guys think they are… 
But I will slap whoever decided to interrupt Papa and Mamma's long-awaited reunion!
Yeah. We have to regroup with the Flower Division, stat. 
…So you're leaving, Orihime? 
…Yes, Papa. 
I won't stop you. This is the path you've chosen. 
However, my portrait is still incomplete. 
Seeing as you modeled for it, you'll need to be there to see the finished piece. 
Papa… 
Orihime… Make sure you come back with Ogami. 
You're our most precious treasure. I hope you know that.
Yes, Mamma! 
Please, Ogami, watch over Orihime.
I ask you as well. Please… Please take care of our daughter. 
Leave it to me. 
Can't wait for the picture.
Just leave it to me, sir. I'll protect Orihime, no matter what! 
Mr. Ensign… <br> Thank you! 
Papa, Mamma, I'll be fine. Mr. Ensign is with me! 
Let's go, Orihime. Everyone's waiting for us. 
Roger that! All right Papa, Mamma, I'll see you later! 
I can't wait to see the finished picture, Mr. Ogata. 
…Yes, of course! Look forward to it! 
Mr. Ensign… <br> I can't wait to see our picture, either. 
Yeah, but before that, we've got a job to do. 
Roger that! All right Papa, Mamma, I'll see you later! 
Papa, Mamma… <br> You don't have to worry about me. 
We'll be coming back together! Isn't that right, Mr. Ensign? 
Yeah. All right, let's go, Orihime! 
Roger that! All right Papa, Mamma, I'll see you later! 
Now that we're done with the shrine, why don't we take a walk around the outer grounds? 
OK. 
… 
Reni… 
Are you not having fun? 
Are you tired? 
Why are you so quiet? 
Reni? Are you not having fun? 
Huh? Why do you ask? 
No, it's just… <br> You seem kind of down. 
I was thinking maybe you weren't enjoying yourself… 
No, that's not it. 
OK… So then why are you… 
Reni? Are you tired? 
Huh? Why do you ask? 
No, it's just… <br> You seem kind of down. 
I was thinking maybe the New Year's crowd wore you out or something. 
No, that's not it. 
OK… So then why are you… 
Why are you being so quiet? 
Ah… Sorry for not answering. 
What's the matter, Reni? 
… 
I was just thinking… Is this what it's like to have fun? 
Huh? 
I have this feeling of satisfaction from getting to see so many new things. 
And on top of that… This is the first time I've gone out with you. 
Reni… 
We still have time before we have to go back to the theater, right, Captain? 
Yeah, that’s right. Well then, let's go for a little walk before we go. 
…Captain, look! 
Oh no! That girl's going to fall into the pond! 
She's running too fast, she won't be able to stop on her own! 
Jump over and save her! 
We have to save her, Reni. Let's get over to the shore! 
Roger! 
Crap, hope we can make it in time! 
I'll go help her! Someone has to save her! 
Reni… 
Dammit! Guess I've got no choice but to go save her, too! 
Crap, hope we can make it in time! 
Hahhhh! 
Captain?! 
H-Huh? That might've been a little… too much… force. 
Whoooooa! 
Captain! 
Achoo! 
Are you all right, sir? 
Yeah… <br> I'm fine, somehow. 
Hahaha… <br> So I guess that's what the fortune meant by "beware of drowning," huh? 
Hahaha, but "after bad luck comes good fortune," right? 
Reni… 
Hahahaha… 
Hahahaha… 
Good grief… Even my fortune made a fool of me. 
… 
But there are two good things that came from it. 
…What? 
First, I saved that girl. 
And saving people's my job, after all. 
… 
Back there, my body started moving without thinking. 
Before I knew it, I was running… Trying to save that girl. 
… 
I used to never think about saving other people. 
I was content only to fight. Nothing else around me mattered. 
And so, I never expected to get any help, either. The only one I could rely on was myself. 
… 
I was alone my entire life. I had no friends, no family… Nobody. 
But… Things are different now. I'm surrounded by people I care about. 
Reni… 
I'll protect you, Reni. 
So you'll protect me, too? 
I'll protect you Reni. 
Because I care about you too. 
Captain… 
So will you protect me too, then? 
Of course, isn't that obvious? 
I see… Thanks, Reni. 
I know how you feel, Reni. 
You don't need to say anything. Let's just stay like this for a while. 
…Yeah. 
By the way, what was the other good thing that came from your fortune? 
The second good thing was… being able to see your smile. 
Captain… 
…! 
Wh-What's going on?! An earthquake?! 
No… This isn't an earthquake. Powerful waves of energy are coming out of the ground. 
Not a mere earthquake, huh? 
Let's hurry back to the theater, Reni. We have to declare an emergency alert! 
Roger! 
Ogami, Reni, reporting for duty! 
What the hell just happened, Kaede? 
We have an emergency, Ogami. Hostiles have appeared in Ouji. 
Hostiles?! Who could it be?! The Black Demons are gone… 
…I don't know. 
I contacted all the other Flower Division members via the Kinematron and told them to return immediately. 
They've already deployed via the Thunderstrike. 
Got it. Let's move out too, Reni. 
I'm ready whenever. 
All right, Kaede, we'll be going. 
OK. Be careful. 
Tenbu startup preparations complete! Ready to launch at any time.
…Captain. 
Reni? What's up? 
We had to cut our shrine visit short to get back to the theater, but… 
Maybe we should… go somewhere together again sometime. 
Reni… 
Yeah, we will! 
We've got a job to do. 
Yeah, we will! I promise, Reni. 
Let's see… Maybe next time we can dress in yukata and visit a festival? 
Captain… Thank you. 
First things first, we've got a job to do before we can think about that. 
Otherwise, they'll just keep interrupting us like they did today. 
…Yeah, you're right. 
Do you really need me to answer that? 
Of course we will, Reni. 
OK… Thank you. 
And that's why we're gonna make it back to the theater alive, Reni. 
Roger! 
OK, Tenbu online!<br>Destination, Ouji! 
Ogami, Reni, moving out! 
Sorry Ogami, but customers are only allowed to purchase one of each bromide. 
I see. That's too bad. 
So sorry, Mr. Ogami, but customers are only allowed to purchase one of each bromide.
