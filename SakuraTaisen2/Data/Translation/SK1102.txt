We managed to drive back the Kouma in the engine room... 
But unfortunately, Tsuchigumo got away. 
Good work. Well, we'll consider defending the engine room a win. 
Sheesh... Can't even catch our breaths first. 
Multiple Kouma inbound from Musashi's direction! 
They're descending upon the deck, one after another! 
Those bastards... They've finally decided to attack the Mikasa directly, then. 
Commander! There's too many of them! We can't shoot them all down! 
The deck is being torn apart by the Kouma! 
GRAAAAWL! 
Commander! The Mikasa's air vent is on the deck! 
If they take out that vent, the Mikasa won't be able to maintain altitude! 
Move out, Ogami! Get on the deck and protect that vent! 
Understood! 
Moment of truth, isn't it?
Understood! 
Moment of truth, isn't it? 
...Man, I'm tired. 
Understood! Moving out immediately! 
Good. We're counting on you, Ogami! 
This is the moment of truth, isn't it? 
Yes, it is. It's as hard for them as it is for us. 
...Man, I'm tired. I could use a break. 
Now's not the time, dumbass! 
If you don't deal with this right now, you'll be taking a break forever! 
R-Roger! 
Dammit, Ogami, what are you standing around for?! 
Snap out of it and get going! 
R-Roger! 
Ogami, the Kouma must have a limit to what altitude they can reach before they cease to function.
No matter how brutal their attacks get, you have to hold out. 
Understood. 
If we can make it through this, we'll finally reach Musashi. Good luck, Ogami! 
Yes, ma'am! 
Sorry, Ogami. I can only sell you one photo per month. 
I see. That's too bad. 
So sorry, Mr. Ogami, but each customer is only allowed to purchase one photo at a time.  
Oh, really? That's too bad.
