Whew… It's over.
Yeah! I was a little nervous, since this was our first battle in some time.
Hee hee! I worked really hard too, you know!
Ahhah! All I want is to get back quickly to the theater and take a nice shower!
Hm hm hm…
…Wh-What's this strange power?!
Aah! <br> What IS that?!
J… Just who the hell are you?!
It's been quite some time… Imperial Assault Troupe.
Y-You're… <br> No, it can't be… <br> Aoi Satan?!
Aoi… Satan? <br> Who is that?
He's… a fearsome man who tried to use demonic powers to destroy the capital a year ago.
But we definitely defeated him, so why…?
Aoi… Satan? <br> That was just a fabricated name… A fabricated life…
Resurrected through the art of necromancy, I live once more!
N… Necromancy?!
Just who resurrected you? And for what purpose?!
There is no need for you to know.
Mamma mia, what are we standing around for? I don't care if he is some old enemy of yours…
If he's their leader, then I'm going to take him down right here and now!
You speak as though you think you can win…
…against I, who bears the divine protection of the capital's hatred!
Now… Get out of my sight!
Aaaah!!
Orihime!
Orihimeee!
You're nothing more than an eyesore. Time to die, little girl…
Orihime!!
Protect Orihime.
Orihime, watch out!
Hngh! <br> So, you mean to stand in my way, Ichiro Ogami?!
There's no way in hell I'll let you do as you please. Orihime is an important comrade of mine.
M… Mr. Ensign?!
Orihime… Are you OK?
…Why did you protect me?
…Wh-Why wouldn't I? You're a member of the Flower Division, and our comrade.
Comrade…?
Listen, Orihime. I think I understand pretty well what you think of me.
But if nothing else, I want you to remember this.
I am captain of the Flower Division. And I will always protect its members!
Trusting each other, cooperating, fighting side-by-side… Isn't that what comrades do?
Mr. Ensign…
O-Orihime!!
Hngh! <br> So, you mean to stand in my way, Sakura Shinguji?!
I won't just stand ideally by and let you do whatever you want! Orihime is… <br> one of our dear comrades!
S-Sakura?!
Are you all right, Orihime?
…Why did you protect me?
Because you're one of us!
When I'm in trouble, Ogami is there to come to my rescue.
When he's in trouble, Iris is there for him…
And if Iris was in trouble… No matter what, any member of the Flower Division would come to her aid!
One of us…?
That's right. We're all comrades who rely on each other, work together, and take care of one another!
Sakura.
…
Ahhah. You all are a bunch of busybodies…
But if we do not defeat this aggravating foe, my mood will only worsen further.
Well then, let us all work together and do our best to bring him down!
Right!
I'm gonna try my hardest, too!
OK, everyone! <br> The real fight starts here!
Hmph! Such prattle!
With my Luminous Blade Mukei in hand, I will wipe each and every one of you from the face of the earth!
Ngh… <br> To think, such a horrific enemy has appeared once again…
