Wowww… Look, Mon Frère, look! That waterfall's amazing!
Mind your surroundings, Captain.
Yeah, I know. Can't let our guard down.
Heheheh, it's true what they say: the weak really ARE sensitive to danger.
Who's there?!
Heheheh… Why would a hunter tell their prey their name?
It's you… Tsuchigumo!
Heh! Ya want us to beat you to a pulp like last time, is that it?
You still don't get it. This is the Black Demon Society's lair…
Meaning you're caught in my web. This won't end like it did last time.
This time… I will hunt every last one of you down!!
