Taisho 15, New Year’s Day
Happy New year! 
Happy New Year, everyone. I look forward to working with you all again this year.
Let’s give it our all this year, everyone.
Yes! Here’s to another year together!
I hope you have a happy New Year, Reni!
Likewise. 
Oh, Reni. You’re the same as you were last year!
Hey, now, what’s wrong with that? Quiet girls like her are far better than noisy ones!
That’s not very convincing coming from you of all people, Kanna.
All right you two. Are you planning to start a fight this soon into the new year?
Ahahaha… Everyone's the same as they ever were.
Alrighty then, how about we have a mochi-pounding party with my invention, “Mr. Mochi”!
K-Kohran hasn’t changed a bit either… Let’s not start the new year with an explosion.
Oh-ho. Forget the mochi. Sounds like the chief would rather get a pounding instead.
Eeehh?! I'm kidding, I'm kidding!! 
Hahahaha… 
Sorry Ogami, but customers are only allowed to purchase one of each bromide. 
I see. That's too bad.
So sorry, Mr. Ogami, but customers are only allowed to purchase one of each bromide.
