Reni, how's your condition?
Not bad.
O-OK… So, Reni… 
How should we attack?
What do you think about that flower?
How should we attack? I wanna hear your thoughts.
The enemy intends to block our advance with long-range artillery.
So, I'm going to destroy the artillery from behind. When the enemy's attention is diverted, we can all rush in.
An ambush that doubles as a diversion, huh? I see…
But doing it alone would be too dangerous.
I'm fine with it. Working with another person would rather be a nuisance.
Got it, just don't do anything reckless.
I won't. It's just something that I can do.
What do you think about that flower, Reni?
A vine plant in the family Fabaceae, Wisteria floribunda, or Japanese wisteria.
…
U-Uh… That's not what I'm asking…
Aren't they beautiful? Even though we're at the battlefield, I think… 
…Is that all?
N-No…
…I'm cutting off the transmission.
H-Hey, Reni… Right, we're in the middle of battling, of course there's no way we can talk about flowers.
…
If you have nothing to discuss, I'm cutting off the transmission.
Ah, Reni! Ah… She cut the transmission.
