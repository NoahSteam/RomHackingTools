Reni, how are you holding up?
…Fine.
I-I see… <br> By the way, Reni…  
About the enemy…
About those flowers…
How do you think we should attack the enemy? I wanna hear your thoughts.
The enemy intends to block our advance with long-range artillery.
So, I'm going to destroy the artillery from behind. When the enemy's attention is diverted, we can all rush in.
An ambush that doubles as a diversion, huh? I see…
But it's too dangerous to go by yourself.
I alone am enough. Additional units would only be a nuisance...
I understand… <br> Just don't do anything reckless.
I won't. I will only do what is necessary.
What do you think about those flowers, Reni?
They are a vine plant in the Fabaceae family, wisteria floribunda. Also known as Japanese wisteria.
…
U-Uh… That's not what I'm asking…
Aren’t they pretty? Even in the heat of battle, you can still find beauty.
…Is that all?
N-No…
…I'm cutting off the transmission.
H-Hey, Reni… <br> Right, we're in the middle of a battle, I suppose we shouldn’t be talking about flowers.
…
If you have nothing to discuss, I'm cutting off the transmission.
Wait, Reni! Ah… <br> He cut the transmission.
