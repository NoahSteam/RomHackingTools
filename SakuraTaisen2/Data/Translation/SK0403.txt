... 
Demon King... What is it you need of me? 
It seems that the assassination of Ikki Yoneda... was a failure. 
Yes... According to Suiko, Yoneda seems to have regained consciousness. 
However, this, too, falls within my calculations. You need not worry. 
For the time being, Yoneda can't lift a finger against us. Nuhuhuhuh... 
This is our opportunity to wipe out both the troupe and the other interloper in one fell swoop. 
Kazutoyo Yamaguchi, you mean? 
I'll do it! 
Ichiro Ogami… He was pretty good but, this time, I’ll crush him!!
That one with the sword, she was pretty skilled for a girl. I wanna fight her again!!
That girl who attacks with those weird lights… She'll make for a helluva fight!!
That yellow one, zipping around all over the place... I'll take her out in one blow! 
That blue guy... He was crazy strong. I wanna fight him for real this time!
Let's not be hasty, Kongo. The first step in any battle is getting to know your enemy... 
Then taking what you've learned and seizing victory through careful calculation. 
Kongo, you've already fought them once before. 
Perhaps we should leave this one to Kasha, he has yet to cross swords with the Assault Troupe. 
I'll fight those little girls in their trash bins, if I truly must… 
I trust you've already arranged a way to get Yamaguchi and the rest of the garbage in one place? 
Indeed, Suiko is already on it. It's all going exactly as planned. 
Suiko? I don't like this one bit. Can that girl really get the job done? 
Don't be like that, Tsuchigumo. No one's better than Suiko when it comes to this sorta thing. 
Well then... <br> I leave it to you, Kasha. 
Heheheh... Behold as my flames consume all... 
...Oh, that time already, huh? Guess I should get started on my night watch. 
It's Kohran's first night back in a long time. I wonder what she's up to. 
Mon Frère! Mon Frèreee!! 
Boss, we have a situation here. Ya got a minute?
What is it? 
Kanna, Iris… What’s the problem?
Mon Frère... Sakura and Kohran, they... 
Apparently they walked out of the theater sayin' they were gonna have a talk with some guy named Kyogoku.
Wh-What?! 
Everyone's gathered in the salon, you should head over there too. 
OK, got it! 
But my night watch... 
OK, got it. 
B-But my night watch... 
Who cares about that! Just get your ass over there! 
Now's not the time to be spacin’ out! Get your ass over there! 
Ow ow ow ow! I'm coming, I'm coming. Please just stop pulling on my ear! 
Ogami, we have quite the problem on our hands. 
I'm sorry! It's all my fault! 
What are you talking about, Saki? 
I heard a rumor earlier today when I was at the Ministry of the Army. 
They said Minister Kyogoku would be hosting a private gathering tonight at a ryotei in Fukagawa… 
I told Sakura and Kohran about it without thinking... 
And then... They both left. 
(I see. Must be because of what happened earlier today.) 
Seriously, though, talk about reckless! 
Right then, Ogami. What do you think we should do? 
We have to go after them!
They'll be fine. 
We have to go after them, now! They could get in big trouble! 
You're right. They're probably both a little worked up. 
All right, now that that's settled, let's go after 'em! 
Not so fast, Kanna. We'll cause a scene if too many of us go. 
Ogami. I have a favor to ask of you. Please bring both of them back. 
We'll be on standby here at the theater. If anything happens, we'll be right there. 
...Understood. 
It’s up to you, Ogami! 
Yes, ma'am! OK, I'm off! 
Those two can take care of themselves. We've got nothing to worry about. 
Ogami… It’s irresponsible to say something like that as the captain.
What would happen if those two got in some kind of trouble? 
Y-You're right... 
Protecting the Flower Division is your sworn duty, isn't it? 
I'll ask you again, Ogami. Please, bring them back. 
We'll be on standby here at the theater. If anything happens, we'll be right there. 
...Understood. 
It’s up to you, Ogami!
Yes, ma'am! OK, I'm off! 
... 
Ogami, I know you're worried about what to do, but we don't have much time. 
Those two could get caught up in all sorts of trouble. 
Y-You're right... 
It's your duty as captain of the Flower Division to look out for your squad. 
I'll ask you again, Ogami. Please, bring them back. 
We'll be on standby here at the theater. If anything happens, we'll be right there. 
...Understood. 
It’s up to you, Ogami!
Yes, ma'am! OK, I'm off! 
This must be the restaurant Saki was talking about. 
Then... Kyogoku must be here, right? 
The guy who talked smack about your dad. 
Kohran... Maybe I should just do this myself after all. 
I don't want to impose on you. 
C'mon, don't be like that. You don't have to worry about me. 
Besides, I love this kinda stuff! 
Kohran... Thanks. 
Right, now there's just the issue of actually getting to this Kyogoku guy. 
A couple girls like us snooping around will just get thrown out... 
You're right. What should we do? 
...! <br> All right, I got an idea! 
Come with me, Sakura. I've got just the thing! 
You're a genius, Kohran! 
Heheheh... Leave it to me! 
One quick costume change and we're a couple of geisha! 
With these disguises, we can now freely walk around the restaurant! 
Exactly. All right, let's go, Sakura. 
This must be the ryotei that Saki mentioned. 
This place looks pretty fancy... It won't be easy getting in. 
All right, let's go! 
All right, let's go! 
Wh-What should I do... 
All right, let's go! There's no use mulling it over! 
I have to bring them back, and quick! 
Wh-What should I do...? <br> This place looks way too fancy, I'm starting to lose my nerve... 
No, I can't be saying things like that. I'll just go in and see. 
Is this really the place? Doesn't seem like the kind of restaurant the girls could even get into... 
Saki said this was it, though, so I'll just go in and check. 
How does it look, Kohran? 
I'm not sure, but it sounds like there's a bunch of people in there talking about something.
Seems kinda fishy... <br> This might be the room that Kyogoku guy's staying in. 
Think we should go for it? 
Yeah. All right, here goes.
Gooood evening! 
I'm Beniyakko! 
A-And I'm Sakurayakko... 
Huh? Who the hell are you?! 
Ah! I-I think we have the wrong room! 
Not only that, b-but these guys look like bad news, too. 
Heheh, what have we here, a couple of geisha! Don't mind him, just bring us some booze! 
What should we do, Kohran? 
...Let's just put up with them for now, then later we can slip out and keep looking for Kyogoku. 
Hey, geisha! Are you comin' or what?! 
Y-Yes, sir. Right away, sir! 
Phew, I've searched just about every room... 
...but I don't see Minister Kyogoku or the girls anywhere. 
All that's left is the room right in front and the room in the back. 
C'mon, geisha girls! Lighten up a little! Guh-huh-huh-huh! 
P-Please stop. 
Huh, that geisha... <br> She sounded kind of like Sakura. 
All right, then... <br> Which room? 
In the back with the geisha
The quiet room up ahead
There's no mistaking it, that voice just now was Sakura's! All right, to the room in the back! 
Oh! You there, sonny. I'm all outta drink! Get me a cold one! 
H-Huh? Sorry, I don't actually work here, sir. 
Actually, sir, if I could ask you a question... 
Do you know which room a man named Kyogoku is staying in? 
Kyogoku? <br> Nawww, I'm Yamaguchi! 
O-OK...? 
Hey now, no need to be so uptight. C'mon, let's share a drink. 
Sorry, but I'm in a hurry... Ah! Wait! Please stop pulling me... 
All right, time to steel myself and enter this room. 
Excuse me. 
...Whaaa? 
Huh? I-I'm sorry, sir, I have the wrong room! I was looking for a man named Kyogoku! 
Hmmm? Kyogoku? Nawww, I'm Yamaguchi! 
...OK? 
C'mon, sonny, have a seat while you're here. 
Oh, sorry, but I'm in a hurry right now. 
Awww, don't be like that. Just sit down already. 
N-No, really, I'm in a big hurry... 
What, you're too good for this old-timer, is that it? 
N-No, that's not it at all, sir... 
Great! Then let's share a drink first! Bottoms up! 
O-OK... 
(Jeez. Now is NOT the time for this.) 
Hmm, which door...? 
Oh! You there, sonny. I'm all outta drink! Get me a cold one! 
H-Huh? Sorry, I don't actually work here, sir. 
Actually, sir, if I could ask you a question... 
Do you know which room a man named Kyogoku is staying in? 
Kyogoku? Nawww, I'm Yamaguchi! 
O-OK...? 
Hey now, no need to be sho uptight. C'mon, let'sh share a drink. 
Sorry, but I'm in a hurry... Ah! Wait! Please stop pulling me... 
Eeeeeek! 
N-No! Stop iiiit!! 
Heheheh... Relax, you won't be sayin' "no" for long! 
I got this, Sakura! 
I brought along Mr. Smoke Bomb for just such an occasion!
All right, here goes! Brace yourself! 
*cough* *cough* <br> Wh-What the hell was that?! 
Jeez, how long are you going to hold on for?! Let go of me! 
You want some more? Then have some of this! 
Thanks, Beniyakko, you're a lifesaver. 
Leave it to me, Sakurayakko! 
All right, now let's get outta here and go look for Kyogoku! 
They're sure making a lot of noise next door... 
Here ya go, son. How's about a drink? 
R-Right... 
Say, why the long face? 
How about you tell me your story, son? 
What are ya doin' in a restaurant like this? 
Well, you see... 
I'm looking for Kyogoku.
I'm looking for my friends. 
I'm looking for Kyogoku.
I'm looking for my friends. 
I came for a drink. 
I'm looking for the Minister of the Army, a man by the name of Kyogoku. 
Oho, Kyogoku, huh? 
My friends are somewhere in this restaurant. 
I came here to find them. 
I see. Your friends, huh... 
Friends are a priceless treasure. There's nothing more valuable in life. 
I know just how you feel, son. You may be young, but you've earned my respect. 
All right, I like ya. Stay here and drink with me till the sun comes up! 
But I just told you, I'm here to find my friends! 
Uh... I came here for a drink. 
Really? Well why didn't ya say so sooner! 
No need to hold back, drink up! Drink! 
Y-Yes, sir! 
(Should I really be doing this...?) 
I'm sorry, sir, but I'm afraid I can't tell you. 
My, sounds awful important. 
All right then, a few drinks oughta loosen your tongue! 
M-Mr. Yamaguchi! 
...Oh yeah, that reminds me, boy. You were sayin' somethin' about Kyogoku earlier? 
Y-Yes... I'm told Minister Kyogoku booked a private room at this restaurant. 
Well... I haven't heard nothin' 'bout Kyogoku comin' here... 
What? 
FIRE!<br>The restaurant’s in flames!! 
IT’S ARSON!<br>Someone's set fires all over the place!
Huh? Fire?! 
F-Fire?! No, you don't think...?! 
Don't look at me! My "Mr. Smoke Bomb" is totally safe and non-combustible! 
Someone else set fire to this place! 
Fire... Flames... 
Ahhhh! H-Help meeeee! 
Settle down, everyone! Calmly proceed to the exits, and don't rush! 
Kohran, if we don't hurry, the patrons of this ryotei will get hurt! 
It's just like... Back then... 
Kohran? 
Someone set these fires on purpose, to kill people... It's... It's just like before! 
K-Kohran! Where are you going?! 
Sakura, you round everyone up and lead 'em to safety! 
I'm... I'm going after whoever did this! 
Wh-What?! Are you serious, Kohran?! 
I’ll never let anyone get away with something so cowardly and cruel! 
I won’t let someone indiscriminately kill innocent people!
I can’t... <br> I can’t lose to this fire!! 
Kohran, wait! Kohraaan!! 
Dammit! Of all the times for a fire to break out! 
Hrrrm... We've got no choice but to run. 
Evacuate. 
Go find the girls. 
Mr. Yamaguchi, we have to evacuate, now! 
You're right, it's too dangerous in here. Let's go outside. 
I'm going to go help the girls. Please evacuate, Mr. Yamaguchi. 
The girls? I'm not sure who you mean, but let's get out of here for now. This room's starting to burn. 
The girls? You mean those friends of yours you were talking about? 
Hrm, I know you're worried, but for now, let's get out of here. This room's starting to catch fire. 
Son? Sonny? What are you doing? There's a cloud of cinders coming your way. 
Ow, hot hot hot!! 
It's gotten too dangerous to stick around here. Let's go outside, son. 
Damn! The fire's spreading fast! 
Indeed, this looks to be arson. 
Eeeeek! I-I don't wanna die! 
Stay calm! We're almost at the exit! 
Sakura?! 
Ah!! O-Ogami?! 
Sakura, what's with that outfit?! 
I'll explain later, Ogami! Kohran, she... 
Now that you mention it, I don't see Kohran anywhere. Where is she? 
She's still in there. She said she was going to find the culprit who set the fires. 
Wh-What?! 
What should we do, Ogami? 
I'll go save her! 
Let's both go save her! 
Let's evacuate! 
I'll go save her! Sakura, you take Mr. Yamaguchi somewhere safe! 
Wait, I’ll go with you!
Don't be reckless, miss. You're just asking to catch fire with an outfit like that. 
Don't worry, Sakura! I'll save Kohran! 
...OK, understood! 
Be careful, Ogami! Bring Kohran back with you! 
Got it! OK, I'm going! 
OK, Sakura, let's both go help Kohran. 
Now hold on a second, son. Think this through a bit more. 
With the young lady dressed like that, she'd just be asking to catch fire. 
Besides, I don't think I can make it out of here alone. 
OK then, I'll take this man someplace safe! 
Very good. My name is Yamaguchi, miss. Charmed. 
OK, Sakura, I leave Yamaguchi in your hands! 
Be careful, Ogami! Bring Kohran back with you! 
Got it! OK, I'm going! 
All right, in that case, let's both evacuate! 
Ogami! Now is not the time for jokes! 
What about Kohran? She's still in there! 
You can't go help your friend dressed like that. This young man's the only one left who can save her. 
Let's both get someplace safe, miss. 
...OK then. Looks like we're out of options. 
Now hurry up, son! Your friend's waiting for you! 
Y-Yes, sir. 
We're counting on you, Ogami! 
G-Got it. OK, I'll be right back! 
What's wrong, son? We don't have time to think things through. 
R-Right... I just don't know what I should do... 
Ogami, please! 
We don't have a choice. All right, son, how about this? 
The young lady can't do anything dressed like this. You'll have to go save your friend yourself.
Let's both get someplace safe, miss. 
...OK then. Looks like we're out of options. 
Now hurry up, son! Your friend's waiting for you! 
Y-Yes, sir. 
We're counting on you, Ogami! 
G-Got it. OK, I'll be right back! 
Damn, this place is too big! 
I'll have to remember the way I came, or else I won't make it back out. 
The order of doors I opened was... Right, left, front, and left. Gotta remember all that. 
Damn, the flames are even stronger over here... 
Over there! It's Kohran! 
Kohraaan! Kohran, waaait!! 
...Ah, Chief! 
What are you doing, Kohran?! We have to get out of here! 
Chief... Why?! 
They shot Yoneda... 
They burned down my home... 
I can't take it anymore! I'm sick of everyone getting hurt! 
Kohran, calm down! 
LET GO OF ME, OGAMI!! 
I don't want to fight anymore!! I'll just burn to death in this fire! 
Kohran...! 
Slap her on the cheek. 
...! 
... 
Get a hold of yourself, Kohran! 
O... gami...? 
I said let go of me! Stay out of my way! 
(Looks like I don't have a choice. I hate to do this, but...) 
Ah! 
Kohran... 
O... gami...? 
I'm sorry. I did that without thinking... <br> But please, Kohran, you have to understand. 
... 
I should be the one apologizing, Chief. 
It's just... When I saw all this fire, it reminded me of my childhood... 
It's just like that day. Fire as far as the eye could see, the air full of gunshots and screams... 
My mom and dad... They got caught in that fire... 
Kohran... 
The Flower Division's like a family to me, and the Imperial Theater's my home. 
I don't want a bunch of maniacs taking that away from me. 
Kohran, if that's what you truly think, then you need to keep your cool. 
You're not alone, OK? 
You have the Flower Division. I'm right here with you, aren't I? 
You're right. I have the Flower Division... My family. 
Thanks a bunch, Chief. I'll stop being so reckless. 
Good. Now let's get out of here before the whole place burns down. 
...Yeah. 
Chief, do you know the way out? 
If we follow the way I came, we ought to be fine... 
We don't have a lot of time. We'll have to rely on your memory. 
We should be all right if I remember which doors I opened and reverse the order. 
But watch out. The doors you opened would be flipped around, too, so left is right and right is left. 
OK, let's go! We've got to escape before the restaurant burns down! 
All right, which door do I open first? 
Open the door on the right. 
Open the door ahead. 
Open the door on the left. 
OK, opening the door on the right! 
All right, that's one room cleared! 
First door down! 
OK, onto the next room! 
Which door should we open next, Chief? 
All right, opening the door straight ahead! 
Hot hot hot! The fire's way too strong in there, we can't go any further! 
OK, if it wasn't the door ahead of us, then... 
OK, opening the door on the left! 
Whoa! The fire's way too strong in there, we can't go any further! 
OK, if it wasn't the door on the left, then... 
Uhh... Which door was it, again? 
Chief, if we don't act quick, we won't make it out in time! 
Even if you don't remember, just try one! Your odds of picking the right one are 1 in 3! 
O-OK then... 
Open the door on the right. 
Open the door ahead. 
Open the door on the left. 
OK, opening the door on the right! 
No good! It's a sea of flames in there! 
Damn, was that not the right door? 
OK, opening the door straight ahead! 
All right! Looks like that was the right door! 
Way to go, Chief! Keep it up! 
OK, let's hurry, Kohran! 
Moment of truth, Chief. Which door do we take? 
The door on the left! Hup! 
Whoa! No good, it's full of fire in there! 
All right, if it wasn't that door, then... 
Uhh... Which door was it, again? 
Chief! If you dawdle around too much, we'll both be burnt to a crisp! 
You're right. All right, it's do or die... 
Open the door on the right. 
Open the door ahead. 
Open the door on the left. 
OK, opening the door on the right! 
Yahoo! Nice going! 
All right! Just a little further till the exit. 
You doing OK, Kohran? I know it's not easy to run in those clothes, but hang in there! 
I'm all right, Chief. Let's get a move on! 
All right, I think this is the last one. If we want to get out of here, we should... 
All right, opening the door straight ahead! 
No good! There's no way we're getting through there! 
Was that not it? Damn, we're running out of time! 
OK, opening the door on the left! 
Hot hot hot! That's a bust!! 
Damn, wrong one! 
Uhh... Which door was it, again? 
There's no time, Chief! You'll just have to guess and go for it! 
Open the door on the right. 
Open the door ahead. 
Open the door on the left. 
OK, opening the door on the right! 
No good, Chief! The flames are too strong to keep going! 
Urgh, dammit! 
All right, opening the door straight ahead! 
Ah! It's full of fire! 
Damn! This isn't it! 
OK, opening the door on the left! 
All right, we did it! We're in the clear! 
Way to go, Chief! That was awesome! You were cool as a cucumber! 
Whew, made it by the skin of our teeth. 
Oh, do I spy some stragglers? 
There's no time! You'll just have to guess and go for it! 
Whoa! There's fire everywhere! 
It's so hot! And these flames! They're not normal, they shouldn't be this strong! 
Kohran, are you OK?! 
Yeah, I'm all right! Don't worry about me. Let's get out of here! 
Still, though, how did the fire get this strong? 
Oh, do I spy some stragglers? 
Who's there?! 
Heheheheh... 
My name... is Kasha. <br> One of the Five Elements of the Black Demon Society. 
The Black Demon Society?! So this fire was your doing! 
Heheheheh... 
Now then, time to incinerate the Imperial Assault Troupe, along with that trash, Yamaguchi. 
Yamaguchi? Why are you after him?! 
Heheheh. "Why" indeed. 
You’ll have plenty of time to ponder that question in Hell! Have fun playing with my flames, won't you? 
Kasha, wait!! 
Th-This is bad, Chief! We're totally surrounded by fire! 
...! <br> There's a gap in the flames! 
We've got no choice, it's do or die. We have to go for it and jump through! 
All right! We escaped! 
Wh-What's that noise?! 
All right! It's the Soaring Whale! 
Ogami, Kohran!! <br> Thank goodness you’re safe!
Sakura! 
Thanks a million, Sakura! 
Oh, right! Sakura, where's Yamaguchi?! 
Yamaguchi is evacuating by car. 
That’s not good! He's being targeted by the Black Demons! 
Leaving by car will only make him a sitting duck for the Hex Mechs! 
Huh?! Th-Then... 
...I can think of two potential plans. 
One, I could act as a decoy and draw the enemy’s attention, during which Yamaguchi can escape.
There's also the option of escorting Yamaguchi and defeating any hostiles that try to approach. 
All right, then, what should we do? 
Go with the decoy plan. 
Go with the escort plan. 
OK, let's go with the decoy plan. That'll give Yamaguchi an opening to escape! 
OK, let's go with the escort plan. We must protect Yamaguchi from the Society, no matter what! 
Roger! Let's hop to it, Chief! 
Ogami, Kohran, good luck out there! 
Sorry Ogami, but customers are only allowed to purchase one of each bromide. 
I see. That's too bad. 
So sorry, Mr. Ogami, but customers are only allowed to purchase one of each bromide.
Oh, really? That's too bad.
