Yo, Sumire! Glad to have ya back, but you haven't gotten rusty on us, have ya?
And you, Kanna, have you adopted a more dignified manner of fighting outside of sheer brute force?
What didja say?!
What of it?!
Hey, now…
All right, then, how 'bout this?
Let's see who can take down the most enemies in just two moves! We'll make it a contest!
How amusing. I accept!
Hey Boss! We'll need ya to keep score, so look sharp!
Ensign! You have not witnessed my dance in some time, so prepare to feast your eyes!
*sigh* <br> Oh, brother.
