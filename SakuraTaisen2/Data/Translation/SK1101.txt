Om maitrashti svaha…<br>Om maitrashti svaha…<br>Om maitra… 
Kouma…<br>Burn the capital to ashes…
True purification… <br> begins with destruction. 
This fake Tokyo created by man… All of it shall be destroyed.
Destroyed by the might of Musashi!
Om maitrashti svaha…<br>Om maitrashti svaha…<br>…svaaahaaaa.
O Musashi… <br> The capital has been freed from its ancient seal.
The vengeful power has been released… All you need to do now is consume. 
Consume… and destroy everything.
Upon this scorched earth, the true Tokyo will be born!
I can’t believe it… Kyogoku was alive this whole time…
It must have been a body double that killed himself after the coup failed, not Kyogoku.
Damn it… He used the coup as a distraction while he hid underground…
Waiting for his chance to revive Musashi.
Even the Kouma have returned…
And those creeps of the Black Demon Society are still alive, too! 
On top of that… The Demon King is actually Sakura’s father…
… 
… 
…Now's not the time to panic, everyone. More than ever, we need to keep a cool head.
Let’s get a grasp on the situation and analyze everything calmly. There must be a way through this.
…True. Our first priority should be to organize all of our information.
Hm. <br> Ogami, is there anything you'd like to ask? 
Ask about the Octagram. 
Ask about Musashi. 
Ask about the Kouma. 
I'd like to ask about the "Octagram of Demonic Calling" Kyogoku mentioned earlier.
This is pure conjecture, but I think I have an idea… Take a look at this.
This is a map of our home, Tokyo.
And here are the locations of our battles with the Black Demon Society. 
All of these locations… They line up perfectly to form an octagon!
Furthermore, all of these places share one thing in common.
The torii gates. 
Torii gates… 
Yes. Each time we fought the Society, a torii gate would appear before or after the battle.
Torii gates, huh? <br> Hmm… Is that right?
Yes… I remember now, there was a torii gate when we fought at the restaurant in Fugawa!
Ikebukuro, Asakusa… <br> There were torii gates there as well.
It's possible that these gates are the keys to casting the Octagram of Demonic Calling.
I believe the Octagram is somehow used to release the city energy inside Tokyo.
The Society likely attacked these places in the capital in order to summon these gates…
All so they could prepare the Octagram for this day.
Damn! If only we had realized this sooner!
What is that enormous object? Kyogoku called it “Musashi”…
Hmm… Honestly, I have no idea what that is.
However, as you all probably sensed yourselves, it is a huge mass of malicious will.
It may be an even greater threat than the Sacred Demon Castle that surfaced two years ago. 
Yeah. I feel sick whenever I look at it.
That said, if we can’t figure out what it is, we have no hope in defeating it…
Right… At this rate, we may just have to apprehend Kyogoku and ask the man himself.
If anyone knows about Musashi’s origins, it would be him.
He was able to summon that enormous thing after all.
According to the Moon Division’s intel, Kyogoku is the descendent of a powerful spirit medium.
I see now… So that’s how he was able to cast such a massive spell…
Why are they controlling the Kouma?
Hmm… I’ve heard rumors about this.
As I understand, the Army secretly collected the demons we defeated during the Kouma War…
And then used them for experiments in order to create artificial Kouma…
Wha… Are you serious?! <br> What did they intend to do with them?! 
…A Kouma combined with machinery is the most formidable weapon of all.
It knows neither fear nor fatigue. Regular weapons have no effect on them and they can be mass produced.
B-But… <br> Why would the Army develop such a gruesome project? 
It was all Kyogoku’s doing. The Kouma Weapons, the Black Demons… Everything was instigated by him.
Perhaps both Yamazaki’s death and the Restoration Army's coup d'etat…
…were all distractions to divert our attention from his true objective.
Damn you, Kyogoku!
What are we gonna do now, Mon Frère? 
Are we… Are we gonna lose to the bad guys?
No, we won’t lose!
There must be something…
If this keeps up… 
No, we won’t lose! We're not just gonna let Tokyo burn to the ground!!
But… How are we gonna fight those huge enemies? 
Well, you see… 
There must be something we can do… It's too soon to give up.
…Really? Is there really a way to fight them? 
If this keeps up…
Are we… gonna die? 
… 
Mon Frère… 
Don’t you worry. This is why you always save your trump card for last.
A… trump card? 
It can’t be… 
Exactly! <br> The Imperial Assault Troupe’s final trump card sleeping beneath Tokyo…
The Aerial Battleship Mikasa!! 
The Mikasa?! But wasn't it destroyed during our battle with Satan?
After it pierced the Sacred Demon Castle, the ship’s bow was made into a memorial park in Tokyo Bay.
But we recovered the hull after the battle, and have been rebuilding it in secret deep below Tokyo. 
Therefore, you could call it the “Shin Mikasa”!
So that's what's happened…
The Mikasa is currently undergoing its final diagnostic check.
As soon as they're complete, we'll board the ship and head for Musashi, where Kyogoku awaits us!
Yes, sir!
Everyone, remain on standby at the theater until the designated time for liftoff. Now, dismissed!
The Aerial Battleship Mikasa… It's waiting to launch right beneath my feet.
Kyogoku… <br> Our battle isn't over yet.
…Ogami. 
Sakura… Something wrong? 
There's… something I want to talk to you about… 
Is it about your father?
Is it about the battle?
Is it about me?
…Is it about your father?
…Yes, that’s right.
…Is it about the battle?
Yes… It’s related to that…
I wanted to talk about… my father.
I see… You mean how the Demon King… might be your father.
…Yes. 
Is it… about me? 
…No, it’s not.
Um… I’ve been thinking… about my father.
Oh, I see… It’s about the fact that the Demon King… might be your father.
…Yes. 
You want to talk about something? What’s on your mind? 
Um… I’ve been thinking… about my father.
Oh, I see… It’s about the fact that the Demon King… might be your father.
…Yes. 
Um… I’d rather not do it here, so… could we step outside?
Got it. <br> Let's go outside, then. 
Sakura, you said that the Demon King’s true identity was Colonel Shinguji… Your father.
…Yes. My father’s stance was unique. There’s no mistaking it, he’s the Demon King.
Ogami… <br> What do you think I should do?
Let's bring him back! 
Didn’t he pass away?
Sakura… Let’s bring Colonel Shinguji back. Let’s bring your father back to the light!
Huh?! 
Perhaps Kyogoku revived your father using the same necromancy he used to resurrect Mayor Yamazaki…
And now Kyogoku is controlling him as the Demon King. 
If we break Kyogoku's spell, I'm sure we can turn him back to normal. 
Ogami, then…
Yes! We just need to take down Kyogoku with everything we’ve got!
…R-Right. 
… 
Ogami, please listen… <br> I’ve made up my mind.
But… Didn’t your father pass away?
I'm sure that… Kyogoku used the art of necromancy to revive him, just like he did with Mayor Yamazaki.
And now I believe Kyogoku is controlling him.
I see… 
… 
Ogami, please listen… <br> I’ve made up my mind.
Hmmm… What should we do?
I’m sorry, that was a difficult question to ask you so suddenly.
… 
Ogami. I’m sure that my father is being controlled by Kyogoku.
If we can break his spell, I think we can turn my father's soul back to normal.
I see… 
… 
Ogami, please listen… <br> I’ve made up my mind.
I’ve decided… to fight my father. 
Huh?! Sakura, why?! 
If my father’s soul was able to overcome Kyogoku’s spell, he would have been freed long ago. 
But, even now, he continues to stand against us as the Demon King. 
What’s more, if we try to attack Kyogoku, he’ll get in our way and defend him just like before.
… 
So, by crossing swords with my father… By speaking through our blades…
I know I’ll be able to break him out of Kyogoku’s spell.
Sakura… 
…Thank you so much, Ogami. Talking with you has given me a bit more strength.
…It's almost time for the Mikasa to launch. Let's head inside.
OK. 
GRAAAAWL! 
…?! 
That noise… <br> It can’t be!
K-Kouma?! 
Damn it. So they've finally come to attack the theater!
GRAAAAWL! 
Ogami, what should we do?! 
Let’s fight!
Let’s run!
Call for help! 
Let’s fight them, Sakura! We’ll hold them off until the Mikasa’s ready for takeoff! 
But the two of us alone can only do so much against so many enemies!
Urgh… <br> What are we gonna do? 
Let’s run, Sakura! The two of us can't possibly take on this many enemies by ourselves. 
B-But, if we run, the Kouma will invade the theater!
We have to protect this place until the Mikasa is ready for takeoff!
Urgh… <br> What are we gonna do? 
I’ll hold back the Kouma. Sakura, you go call for backup!
No way! Fighting the Kouma all on your own would be too reckless!
But, if I don’t stop the Kouma here, they’ll get inside the theater!
Even so, I won't abandon you! 
Urgh… <br> What are we gonna do? 
O-Ogami!! 
GRAAAAWL! 
Urgh… <br> What are we gonna do? 
Sorry to keep you waiting, Ogami! 
T-That voice… 
Ka… Kayama?! 
The Moon Division’s got this, Ogami. Just get down to the command room, quickly!
B-But… 
Ogami, do you know what makes me happy more than anything else?
Seeing Tokyo at peace…
It’s being able to protect the smiles of all the people in this city. <br> Now go, Ogami.
Kayama… 
Relax. We can hold the Kouma back, at least until the Mikasa takes off.
We’re counting on you!
Watch yourself! 
Kayama… <br> We're counting on you! 
You got it. And Ogami… <br> Put an end to Musashi!
…Right!
Come at me, Kouma! In the name of the Moon Division, I won’t let you get past this point.
Kayama… 
Watch yourself, Kayama! No matter how strong you are, fighting the Kouma all by yourself would be… 
Don't worry, Ogami. We may not be able to pilot Spirit Armor but the Moon Division is trained for combat.
We may have fallen one step behind the enemy's plan… 
But I swear, by our honor as the Moon Division… <br> We’ll hold them off here!
Kayama… 
Kayama… 
Ogami… 
There's a saying I know, "Prompt action brings success." 
Tokyo doesn't have much time left. You need to launch the Mikasa as soon as possible!! 
Run, Ogami! <br> Run towards our victory!! 
Yeah. <br> We'll meet again, Kayama! 
Let's go, Sakura! 
Roger! 
Commander Yoneda! Is the Mikasa going to launch?! 
… 
Final inspection complete! All systems are nominal!
Evacuation of citizens on the launch ramp, complete! 
Commander Yoneda. <br> Your next orders, please. 
…Commander Yoneda. 
…Mhmm. 
The future of Tokyo… rests on the shoulders of this battleship…
And in the hands of us, the Imperial Assault Troupe.
We are about to engage in the greatest military operation the world has ever seen.
Aerial Battleship Mikasa, prepare for liftoff!!
300 seconds after launch, speed has leveled out! 
Main engines, all six sections read all clear!
Releasing safety locks on all gunports. Switching to primary combat position. 
We did it! The Mikasa is finally airborne! 
It's still too early to celebrate, Ogami. We’ve only just entered the arena.
The real battle starts now. Don't let your guard down.
Roger! 
Commander Yoneda, your orders. 
Mhmm. 
Switch to secondary combat position.
Switch to secondary combat position.
Increase main engine output by 20%.
Increase main engine output by 20%.
Increase altitude 100 meters per minute.
Increase altitude 100 meters per minute.
Kyogoku… <br> We're not going to let you have Tokyo. 
Final destination is… Musashi! 
Final destination is… Musashi! 
In the face of the Kouma, even our Imperial Navy is nothing more than a candle in the wind… 
At this rate, it’s only a matter of time before Tokyo is no more.
We have just one last ace in the hole. 
They are the only ones that can obstruct Kyogoku's ambitions.
The Aerial Battleship Mikasa… And the Imperial Assault Troupe. 
We’re entrusting the future of Tokyo… to you.
Right, then… The Mikasa has launched safely.
Now, I'd like to discuss our plan of action. 
All right, time to show that Musashi what for!
Ogami, if it were up to you, how would you go about fighting Musashi?
Bombard it from the Mikasa.
I’d attack its weak point.
Destroy it from the inside.
If it were up to me… <br> I would bombard it from the Mikasa. 
Oh, nice idea. A test of strength between us and Musashi. 
But, even with the Mikasa’s main cannon, would that be enough firepower to take down Musashi?
Uh… That's… 
If it were up to me… <br> I’d attack its weak point.
I see… That does indeed sound like a good strategy.
However, we lack any intel on where Musashi is most vulnerable.
Uh… Right. <br> That’s certainly true.
If it were up to me… <br> I’d infiltrate Musashi, destroying it from the inside.
Heh, seems like we both came to the same conclusion.
…It's a dangerous strategy. 
But it’s the only option we’ve got if we’re to destroy Musashi.
Uh… To be honest, I haven't given it much thought.
Come on, Ogami. Get a grip. 
We finally manage to get the Mikasa in the air and you don’t have a strategy? 
You're from the Navy, you should already have some ideas on how to deploy this battleship. 
Y-Yes, sir. 
Now then, let me explain the details of our operation. Direct your attention to the monitor.
From here on, the Mikasa<br>will gradually ascend…<br>
until its altitude matches<br>the Musashi.
After that, we’ll accelerate towards our enemy at maximum output…
Once we reach top speed, we’ll create an opening in the mouth with our cannon and force our way inside.
Hold up, we’re gonna ram the whole ship into that thing?! 
Well, to put it simply, yes, that’s the idea.
If we want to take the fight directly to Musashi… This is the only way.
But of course, this is Kyogoku. He likely already predicted that we’d come here with the Mikasa.
Whoops… <br> Seems we have some uninvited guests coming aboard. 
The Kouma are approaching from above! They’re attacking the deck!
Emergency alert! The Kouma have infiltrated both sides of the engine room!
If the engine is destroyed, the Mikasa will stall and be unable to maintain altitude! 
Tsch… <br> Looks like those bastards plan to destroy us from the inside as well. 
Time to move out, Ogami! Split into two units of four and drive the Kouma out of the engine room!
Understood! 
Ogami, take me with you. Please!
OK, come with me!
Take care of the 2nd unit.
OK, come with me! <br> I'm sure I’ll need your strength, Sakura.
Yes, sir! <br> I'll give it my all! 
I need you to take care of the second unit. Protecting the other engine room is just as important.
…Understood. Then I'll work with the other team.
…Good luck, Ogami.
You're not going to leave me behind, are you, Ensign? 
Of course not! 
I leave the others to you.
Right, of course not! <br> Let's go together, Sumire!
Ohohohoho! <br> Why of course! 
I leave the detachment to you, Sumire! You’re the only one who can protect the other engine room.
I feel like I drew the short end of the stick…
But very well. I will work with the other team.
Captain, please let me join your team. 
I'm counting on you. 
Take care of the 2nd unit.
Yeah, I'm counting on you, Maria. It will be reassuring to have you by my side. 
Understood. We will protect the Mikasa until the end. 
Maria, I need you to take care of the other unit. I’d feel better knowing you were guiding them.
…Understood. I will work with the detachment.
Captain… Please take care. 
You're gonna put me in your team, right, Boss?
Yeah, let's go together!
Take care of the 2nd unit.
Yeah, let's go together! You're a reliable ally in times like this!
All right, now we’re talkin’! Time to show ‘em what the mighty Kanna Kirishima’s made of!
Kanna, please take care of the other unit. Let's spread out our strength and drive out the enemy.
…OK. I'll do as you say, Boss. 
Leave the other team to me! 
Mon Frère. You absolutely have to take me with you!
OK, got it. 
Hold your horses, Iris…
OK, got it. <br> Let's go together, Iris. 
Yay! I'm gonna do my best for you, Mon Frère!
Hold your horses, Iris… <br> I need you to go with the other team this time.
Whaaaat? <br> So I can't go with you?! 
…Sorry, Iris. But I hope you understand. 
Hm… OK. 
Chief. I’m ready to go at any time!
Come with me! 
Take care of the 2nd unit. 
OK, Kohran. Come with me! 
You got it! This ship is the theater's technological crown jewel. I absolutely won't let it crash!
Kohran, I need you to take care of the second unit. Please protect the other engine room.
'Kay. Got it. 
I wanted to go with you, but… I'll give it my all with the other team.
Such drab battles like this are not really my style, but… what would you have me do?
Would you go with me?
Take care of the 2nd unit.
If you want… Would you like to go with me?
…I have no choice, it would seem. But if it is with you, Mr. Ensign, I suppose I do not mind pitching in.
I need you to take care of the second team, Orihime. 
What is the meaning of this? Why do you not choose me, Mr. Ensign?
I will still defend the others, but I am not happy about this!
…Captain. <br> Your orders, please. 
Join my team. 
Take care of the 2nd unit.
You're gonna join my team, Reni! 
…Understood. 
Reni, I need you to take care of the other unit.
…Understood. 
…All right, it's decided.
Sakura… 
Sumire… 
Maria… 
Kanna… 
Iris… 
Kohran… 
Orihime… 
Reni… 
You four, mobilize with Ogami. The other four will deploy as a separate team. 
Time to move out! Don't let the Mikasa get beaten by the likes of these Kouma! 
Yes, sir!
Sorry Ogami, but customers are only allowed to purchase one of each bromide. 
I see. That's too bad. 
So sorry, Mr. Ogami, but customers are only allowed to purchase one of each bromide.
Oh, really? That's too bad.
