Hey, Mon Frère… <br> Do you remember how Reni looked when you gave her the flower crown?
She was really cute.
You looked cuter.
I thought it might snow.
She looked really cute. I didn't think she could look like that.
Uh-huh! <br> It was wonderful to see Reni smile!
Actually, I think you looked even cuter than Reni back then.
Are you saying you don't care that Reni smiled, Mon Frère?
S-Sorry… I guess now's not the time to make jokes.
Seeing Reni smile like that, I half expected it to start snowing in the middle of August…
You're so mean, Mon Frère! Reni's a girl too, you know! Watch what you're saying!
S-Sorry, Iris…
…
What's wrong, Mon Frère? <br> Don't you remember?
Cheer up, Iris. <br> Reni smiled because you were smiling.
So come on, Iris. You gotta cheer up!
You're right. Reni won't smile if I'm feeling sad.
I'm gonna be so cheerful, that Reni will always feel like she can smile!
That's it, Iris, that's the spirit!
