Hey, Mon Frère... <br> Do you remember how Reni looked when you gave her the flower crown? 
She was really cute. 
You looked cuter. 
I thought it might snow. 
She looked really cute. I didn't think she could look like that. 
Uh-huh! <br> It was wonderful to see Reni smile! 
I actually think you looked cuter then. 
Are you saying you don't care that Reni smiled, Mon Frère? 
S-Sorry... I guess now's not the time to make jokes. 
Seeing Reni smile like that, I was expecting it to start snowing, too... 
You're so mean, Mon Frère! Reni's a girl too, you know! Watch what you're saying! 
S-Sorry, Iris... 
... 
What's wrong, Mon Frère? <br> Don't you remember? 
Cheer up, Iris. <br> Reni smiled because you were smiling. 
So come on, Iris. You gotta cheer up! 
You're right. Reni won't smile if I'm feeling sad. 
I'm gonna be so cheerful, that way Reni can always smile! 
That's it, Iris, that's the spirit!
