Mhm hm hm! Now, just how on earth were you all struggling against an enemy such as this?
Amazing… That’s…
…Orihime for you!
…a Flower member for you!
…my command skills for you!
That's Orihime Soletta for you! Only an elite member of the Star Division could pull that off.
Hmmph! Now, Mr. Ensign, that isn't quite right!
I am Orihime Soletta… An elite member of the Flower Division!
Orihime…
That's a Flower Division member for you! Isn't that right, Orihime?
Hm hm, right you are! I may still wear the clothes of the Star Division…
…but my heart is with you all, right here and now!
Orihime…
Hrmm… A timely sortie, seamless troop movements… Yep, that's my command skills for you!
…You certainly are a simple-minded man, aren't you, Mr. Ensign?
But still… You are also a wonderful man, too…
Hm? What was that?
Why, nothing! Nothing at all!
Hahaha… You're the same as ever, Orihime.
Is that so? I believe I have changed quite a bit.
If you say so, then it must be true.
I'll be counting on you to fight just like that from now on, Orihime!
Of course! And you had best pull your own weight, as well!
