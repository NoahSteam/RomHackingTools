Ensign! Just why, exactly, did you leave me behind?!
Well, you see…
You're too important to me…
I wanted you to lead them. 
You're too important to me, Sumire…
I couldn't bear to let anything bad happen to you.
Ensign…
Be that as it may, I can hardly believe you would be so evasive with me after everything…
If you believe me some run-of-the-mill young lady, then you are most sorely mistaken.
Hahaha, that's true enough. OK, I'm counting on you to lead the second squad.
Indeed, you may leave them to me!
I wanted you to lead the second squad for me, Sumire.
Oh?! D-Dear me, so that was your intention all along?
I do wish you had informed me of such from the outset…
S-Sorry.
Well, no matter. You may leave them in my capable hands!
Yeah, I know I can. Thanks, Sumire.
Um, no reason in particular, I guess…
…What? Is that all?
I'm sorry, Sumire. It seems like I've just made things more uncomfortable…
N-No, never you mind that.
Well, I'll let you handle those enemies, Sumire.
Indeed, you may leave them to me!
