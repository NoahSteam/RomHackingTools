Wow, it's been a long time since I was last at the theater. I wonder how everyone is. 
Oh, Ogami! 
Ahh! Is it... <br> Is it really you, Ogami? 
Sakura... 
I-I'm sorry. What a strange thing to say. 
I had so many dreams about you returning that… I thought maybe this was another dream. 
Sakura... 
I'm back. 
This isn't a dream. 
I dreamt of this, too. 
I'm back, Sakura. I'm so happy to see you again. 
Welcome back, Ogami... 
I look forward to working with you again. Let's both do our very best! 
Same to you. Let's give it our all. 
I'm happy that you were dreaming of me… but this isn't a dream. 
Yes, you... You're right. You and I can be together again. 
I'll be counting on you once more, Ogami. 
Yes. And I'll be relying on you, as well. 
I dreamt of this, too. Of coming back to the troupe, and seeing you again. 
Ogami... Thank you. 
I'm so happy to know you felt the same way. 
Sakura... 
Ogami, please say something. You're not embarrassed, are you? 
S-Sorry... Somehow, the words just wouldn't come to me. 
But I'm so glad to see you again, Sakura. That's how I really feel. 
Somehow, it's finally starting to sink in. 
The Grand Imperial Theater, this is the place I've been assigned to. 
And starting today, I'll be serving here as captain of the Imperial Assault Troupe. 
I look forward to working with you again. 
Yes. I'll do my utmost to ensure that the citizens of the capital can lead peaceful lives. 
By the way, Ogami, I'm sorry I couldn't come to meet you. 
Ever since this morning, I've been hard at work on your-- Oops! 
My... What? 
Um... Noth... I-It's nothing. 
Well, I have something to take care of, so I'll be off. 
That was rather sudden. Wonder what that was about. 
Oh! Mon Frère!! 
That voice... 
Yaay, yaay! <br> Mon Frère, Mon Frère! <br> You came baaack! 
I've been waiting for you to come back for sooo long! 
Iris, is that you? 
I'm relieved to see you're doing well. And in such high spirits, too. 
Heehee! That's 'cause I'm super-duper happy! 
Lookie, Jean-Paul the bear is happy, too! 
Hahaha. Thanks, you two. 
Hey, Mon Frère... 
Hm? What is it? 
Mon Frère, do you notice anything different about me? 
Is something different? 
You're even prettier now. 
Is something different? 
You're even prettier now. 
You're more grown-up now.  
Is something different? 
Sheesh, Mon Frère! It's been so long since we saw each other! 
So you're supposed to say that I'm prettier, or more grown-up, or something! 
I-I see. I'm sorry. 
You're just the same as always. You don't understand a lady's heart at all! 
Urm, yeah. 
You're right. You're even prettier now than you used to be. 
Hee hee hee, really? <br> Yaay! I'm so happy! 
Um, but Mon Frère, did you notice anything else? 
Huh? Did something else happen? 
Yep! I'm 11 years old now. 
Don't you think I'm more grown-up now? 
Y-Yeah. 
You're right. You're more grown-up now. 
Really? So you did notice! I knew you would, Mon Frère! 
I'm 11 years old now. I'm a real adult now, huh? 
Hahaha, that you are.
Hee hee… <br> Thank you, Mon Frère. 
Mon Frère, why won't you say something?!  
Uh... S-Sorry. You asked me so suddenly. 
Sheesh, you're so dense! 
Sorry, Iris. 
By the way, how is everyone else in the Flower Division? 
Um, so right now, it's just me and Sakura here. 
Huh?! Where'd everyone else go? 
Sumire went home to her family because her grandpa fell ill. She's there now. 
Kanna went to Okinawa to train... 
Maria has work to do in New York... 
...and Kohran is also working at the Hanayashiki Branch. 
Oh, so I won't get to see everyone. 
But it's OK, 'cause everyone will be back by this summer! 
Besides, now that you're here, I won't be so lonely anymore. 
Is that so? I’m glad to hear that, Iris. 
Oh, that's right! I have to go get ready now. 
Later, Mon Frère, I'll be going now! Bye-bye!! 
Hey, Iris! <br> And she's gone.  
But I wonder what she's getting ready for. Now I'm curious. 
Hey there, Ogami. 
Oh, General Yoneda, so you're just arriving, too? 
Hey now, as long as we're inside the theater, I'm just the manager, so it's "Mr. Yoneda" to you. 
Ah, my apologies. I wasn't thinking. 
Eh, I suppose you only did just return. Just be more careful from now on. 
That aside, as of today at 1200, you'll be appointed captain of the Flower Division. 
Fill out your arrival forms at the secretarial office, then report to my office at 12 o'clock sharp.
Right, understood. 
R-Right... Understood. 
Right, understood. 
Hmm. That's a nice, prompt reply. 
R-Right... Understood. 
...It took you a little while to respond, there. 
... 
Hey, Ogami, you gonna say something or not? 
Uh... I-I'm sorry. 
For pete's sake, just as carefree as ever, aren't you? 
Whether you reply right away or take your time, the person you're talking to will respond differently.
As captain of the Flower Division, you'd best take care how you speak to people. 
Now then, it's not quite noon yet. Why don't you go wander around the theater until then.
I have until 12 o'clock to go to the manager's office, huh? 
I've still got some time, so I guess I'll take a walk around the theater. 
Shoot, it’s 12 o’clock already?! 
I need to get to the manager's office! I can't believe I'm going to be late on my first day back. 
Ogami. 
That voice... 
It's been quite some time, Ogami. Do you remember me? I'm Kasumi Fujii, from the secretarial office. 
Ah, Kasumi. I'm going to be working here at the theater again. 
Yes, I heard as much from Mr. Yoneda. We're grateful to have you back. 
By the way, Ogami, have you filled out your arrival forms yet? 
No, not yet. 
I thought so. Well, please come to the secretarial office so we can get the formalities out of the way. 
Eeek! 
Whoa?! 
O-Ogami! I'm so sorry! 
I'm perfectly fine, but are you all right, Sakura? 
Yes, I'm fine. Thanks for your concern. 
I don't have much time, so I need to get moving... I'm really sorry. 
Can I help?
What are you doing? 
Is there something I can help you with? You seem pretty busy. 
N-No, it's fine, but I appreciate you asking. 
Uh... You only just returned to the theater, so please take it easy. 
I guess I will, but if there's ever anything I can help you with, just let me know. 
OK. Thanks so much. 
You're sure in a hurry. What are you doing? 
Um, I'm going to the kitchen... 
The kitchen? What for? 
Huh? Er, well... <br> N-Nothing at all! 
O-Ogami? Are you sure you're OK? 
Sorry, sorry, I should've said something. I'm fine, really. 
I'm such a klutz. I'm sorry. 
You don't need to worry about me. If you're busy, you should get moving. 
Is that so? All right. 
Well, I'm in a bit of a hurry, so please excuse me. 
Hahaha, look at her go. 
Still, I wonder what she's in such a rush for. 
Ogami. 
That voice... 
It's been quite some time, Ogami. Do you remember me? I'm Kasumi Fujii, from the secretarial office. 
Ah, Kasumi. I'm going to be working here at the theater again. 
Yes, I heard as much from Mr. Yoneda. We're grateful to have you back. 
By the way, Ogami, have you filled out your arrival forms yet? 
No, not yet. 
I thought so. Well, please come to the secretarial office so we can get the formalities out of the way. 
My apologies, Ogami, but this area is off-limits. 
Off-limits? What for? 
There are some repairs going on in the basement, so no one can go down there. 
Additionally, this area back here is off-limits to you in particular, Ogami. 
Off-limits only to me? What are you talking about? 
I'm very sorry, but I can't say any more at the present. 
In any case, please take care you don't tread into any off-limits areas. I hope you understand. 
I apologize, Ogami, but the back rooms and the basement are currently off-limits. 
Oh right, I remember you telling me that. Oh well, I suppose I'll head somewhere else. 
Ah, Ogami! 
You remember me, don't you? It's Yuri Sakakibara, from the secretarial office. 
Nice to see you again after so long, Ogami. It's me, Kasumi Fujii from the secretarial office. 
Ogami, welcome! 
Ah, sorry about that! I just yelled out like I always do. 
Tsubaki Takamura here, from the gift shop. I hope you'll come by to purchase some bromides again! 
It's been a while, everyone! Let's all work hard together again. 
All right, Ogami, here's that arrival paperwork to fill out, if you please. 
You got it. Let's see... How's this? 
Yes, that should do. Thank you very much. 
Ogami, if you hear any juicy gossip, be sure to bring it my way! 
And we have lots of new bromides in stock, so be sure to swing by and buy one! 
I'm sure we'll have plenty of odd jobs for you to help with again. I'll be counting on you. 
Same here. Let's all do our best. 
We look forward to working with you! 
OK, where to next? 
Ogami. 
Hey, Tsubaki, you seem to be in a good mood. 
Absolutely! I'm really excited to have you back with us! 
Ogami, what makes you happiest about returning to the theater? 
Fighting for peace. 
Seeing you again, maybe?
Being able to fight for the sake of peace, of course. 
A straight-laced answer is just what I expected from you, Ogami! 
Getting to see you again, maybe? 
Oh, quit messing around! You're quite the flirt, aren't you, Ogami? 
Being straight-laced and being flirty are both a part of who you are. 
Whether you're being all cool and serious, or flirting and joking around, it suits you either way. 
Depending on what attitude you take, the words you use to get your meaning across will change, too. 
I see… 
But maybe you shouldn’t worry so much about all that stuff. 
You are who you are, Ogami. And I think you're just fine that way! 
Well, I should be going. Come by the gift shop later if you'd like! 
Being straight-laced, or being flirty... I wonder which is most like me. 
OK, I'd better get to the manager's office. 
Ack! It's past 12 o'clock already! 
If I don't get over to the manager's office right away, he'll be furious! 
Oh, Ogami. Is there something you need? 
Tell me some gossip. 
I'll come back later. 
By the way, during the year you weren't here... 
...public transit in the capital has seen a lot of growth. 
Really? How so? 
Like steam taxis, for instance. There's been a huge boom in steam-powered automobiles. 
For just a single yen, you can go anywhere in the city! It's both fast and convenient. 
Right now, taxis are outpacing rail transport in popularity at a huge rate! 
Wow, that's something else. 
Ogami, have you heard of "Mikasa Memorial Park"? 
Remember how the Aerial Battleship Mikasa crashed in our previous battle? 
The bow of that ship is still sitting in Tokyo Bay... 
...so it was opened to the citizens of the capital to be used as a park. 
Huh, is that so? 
Once we learned you were coming back, it was crazy around here for a few days. 
Iris was running around the theater in high spirits... 
...and Sakura got all fired up and cleaned your room for you. 
We did some repairs to the theater while you were gone, too. 
We even added some new rooms, like a game room and a music room. 
Also, we outfitted other places like the dining hall with some new decorations. 
Wow. I'll have to go check them out later. 
The basement is still under repair though, so it's off-limits. Take care not to go down there. 
Over at the gift shop, we have some new bromides of the Flower Division available for purchase. 
You can only buy one per month, but I heard that if you get one every month, something good will happen! 
Something good? 
Heheh, that's something to look forward to once you've collected all of them! 
Hey Ogami, I heard you sailed around the entire world during your stint in the Navy, right? 
What sorts of places did you visit? Tell me some interesting stories! 
I can't talk about that with anyone outside the Navy. Sorry. 
Aww, that's no fun. But I suppose it makes sense when I think about it. 
Well, if any more gossip-worthy news comes along, be sure to tell me! 
The Flower Division will be putting on four different plays this year. 
With more time to prepare, we can hold more lavish, quality productions... That's the idea, anyway.
Our production for the summer season is "King Lear." It's slated to open in June. 
I saw a huge rat in the attic earlier. Goodness, did it spook me. 
Hm? The attic? You can reach it by taking the stairs up from the second floor. 
Sorry, Ogami, but I'm all out of gossip for now. 
I'll have some more interesting tidbits to share another time, so look forward to it! 
Thanks, Yuri. If anything happens, I'll come ask you about it. 
And if any interesting gossip comes your way, be sure to let me know! 
Ogami. 
Hey, Sakura. Enjoying the sunlight? 
Yes. The weather's so nice today, I decided to take a little walk. 
(Her hair is gleaming in the spring sunlight, it's really lovely.) 
Is there something stuck in my hair? 
N-No, not really. 
I just caught sight of your hair and was admiring it. Sorry, I shouldn't have stared like that. 
Thank you, Ogami. Hearing you say that... makes me so happy. 
(I can see myself reflected in her eyes...) 
Ogami, I can see my reflection in your eyes... 
Yeah, I can see myself in yours, too. 
Heheh... <br> Oh, I'm a little embarrassed. 
The way you're looking at me, it's making me blush. 
(Sakura looks really good in that kimono.) 
This kimono has so many memories attached to it. 
So I want to continue wearing it and treasure it for a long time to come. 
You know, that navy uniform suits you really well, Ogami. 
(Has Sakura's chest... gotten bigger?) 
Ogami. Where exactly were you looking just now? 
Uhh, w-well... 
Make an excuse. 
I-I just... saw your outfit and was thinking how pretty it is... 
Is that so? 
Y-Yes, really! 
Well, that's fine then. It just seemed like you had a perverted look in your eye. 
Err... Well, you see... 
Ogami, you had better not be staring at me with that perverted look in your eye. 
It's pretty embarrassing for me, you know? 
I-I'm sorry. I'll be more careful. 
(I'd better stop leering like this. I don't want her to get angry again.) 
Just where are you looking, Ogami? 
I should get going. See you later, Sakura. 
Sure. Let's talk again later when we have more time. 
Ogami, spring is the season of meetings... Or, so they say. 
And today is the day of a new meeting for you and me. 
From here on, let's make some more fun memories together. 
Yeah. 
We'll make plenty of them. 
We're making one now.
Happy memories, fun memories, we'll make plenty of them. 
...Yes. 
We're making another memory right now, just talking to each other like this. 
That's true. It's a memory I'll treasure dearly. 
... 
... 
Perhaps we should get going soon, Ogami. 
Yeah, you're right. I was on my way to Manager Yoneda's office, anyway. 
Then I'll take my leave. Let's talk again later when we have more time. 
Guess I should get going, too. 
Such lovely weather. The spring sunshine is beaming down on everything. 
I wish I could relax here a while longer, but I really need to be going. 
Welcome! Is there anything I can get you? Oh…! 
Ogami, is that you? Good to see you again! It's me, Tsubaki Takamura! 
Tsubaki, good to see you too. I've been reassigned to the theater. Happy to work with you again. 
Yes, I heard about it from Mr. Yoneda! I could hardly wait to have you back. 
When all's said and done, you're by far my most loyal customer! 
Wh-What the… That's why you wanted to see me? 
Oh, by the way! Have you filled out your arrival paperwork yet, Ogami? 
No, not yet. 
Well that's not good! You're just making more trouble for Kasumi and Yuri! 
All right then, I'll bring you to the secretarial office. Come on, let's go! 
Welcome, Ogami! Would you like to buy something? 
Buy a bromide. 
Talk to Tsubaki. 
Leave. 
Could I buy a bromide? 
Ogami, didn't you buy one earlier? 
We need to keep enough in stock for the patrons, so please enjoy the one you bought for now. 
You'd like to buy a bromide? Thank you very much! 
Oh right, I have a request to make, Ogami. 
Please only buy one bromide per month. We need to keep enough in stock for the other customers. 
I'm sure you'd like to collect more but, for the sake of the patrons, please limit your purchases. 
That's a bromide of Sakura. 
It seems like Sakura was really looking forward to your return, Ogami. 
How about buying a bromide to show your support for her? 
Let's see... Sakura's bromide, right? 
That'll be 50 sen. Thank you very much! 
That's a bromide of Sumire. 
Sumire is at her family's home right now. 
Let's see... Sumire's bromide, right? 
That'll be 50 sen. Thank you very much! 
That's a bromide of Maria. 
Maria's currently in America, escorting Count Hanakoji. 
Let's see... Maria's bromide, right? 
That'll be 50 sen. Thank you very much! 
That's a bromide of Kanna. 
Kanna's back home in Okinawa to do some karate training at the moment. 
Let's see... Kanna's bromide, right? 
That'll be 50 sen. Thank you very much! 
That's a bromide of Iris. 
I bet Iris would be pretty lonely without everybody in the Flower Division keeping her company. 
Make sure you're kind to her, Ogami. 
Let's see... Iris's bromide, right? 
That'll be 50 sen. Thank you very much! 
That's a bromide of Kohran. 
Kohran's off doing some work at the Hanayashiki Branch right now. 
Let's see... Kohran's bromide, right? 
That'll be 50 sen. Thank you very much! 
You don't want to buy anything? That's too bad... 
Ogami, did you know? The Flower Division will be putting on four performances this year. 
Summer, fall, winter, and spring. Every three months when the seasons turn, a new play will debut.
The next one, our summer performance, starts in June. 
I see, but why open the gift shop if there's no performance running right now? 
We do have some patrons who come to buy bromides and such even when there isn’t a show at the moment. 
But that aside, I love working here. I get to see our patrons' smiling faces! 
Is that so? Tsubaki, you're incredible. 
So your ticket punching job will be on hold until June, Ogami. 
Hmm. I'm relieved, but also kind of sad. 
Well, I should be going. Keep up the good work. 
Thank you very much! Come back soon! 
Thank you very much! Come back and buy another bromide next month! 
This entryway seems to be exclusively for VIP patrons. 
Doesn't seem to be anyone here. I should go. 
Huh? No one's here, but something smells amazing. 
Someone must have been cooking in here just a little while ago. 
Yep, no one else here. Was someone making food? 
Come to think of it, I'm getting hungry. Well, it is almost noon. 
Oh yeah, I only have until 12 o'clock to go to the manager's office. I'd better not be late. 
The dining hall seems a little different than before. 
Kanna was always in here, chowing down. Man, that takes me back. 
Whenever there's a performance going on, this lobby is jam-packed with people. 
But since there's no show today, I guess there aren't any visitors, either. 
So this is the stage where the Flower Division holds their performances, huh? 
I'll get to see Sakura and the others singing and dancing up on this stage again. 
This must be the entrance hall. The moment I pass through here, I also become an employee of the theater. 
As captain of the Flower Division, I must strive to work as hard as I did on my very first day here. 
OK, guess I'll head into the manager's office. 
Ogami. 
It's been quite some time, Ogami. Do you remember me? I'm Kasumi Fujii, from the secretarial office. 
Of course I do, Kasumi. It has been a while. 
Yes, I heard as much from Mr. Yoneda. We're grateful to have you back. 
By the way, Ogami, have you filled out your arrival forms yet? 
Uh, I haven't... 
I thought so. Well, please come to the secretarial office so we can get the formalities out of the way. 
Oh, Mon Frère. What are you up to? 
I thought I'd go visit everyone's rooms. 
Anyone who isn't here right now locked their rooms, so you can't get in. 
Oh, that's right, a lot of people are away at the moment. 
So, are you feeling lonely… 'cause everyone's gone? 
I'm fine if you're here. 
I can hold out. 
Yeah, I'm lonely. 
Yes, but you're here, Iris, so I'm fine. 
Really?! Eheheh. Thanks, Mon Frère! 
I'm not lonely either, 'cause you're here! 
Yes, but I can hold out a little longer. 
…Yeah. I'm gonna hold on, too. 
I thought everyone would be here, so... Yeah, I'm lonely. 
Yeah... It is pretty lonely, huh? 
But everyone's supposed to be coming back this summer. So let's hold on until then. 
Yeah, that's true. You know, I think you cheered me up a bit, Iris. 
... 
Mon Frère... 
Iris. There are times when, even if you're feeling lonely, you can't say it out loud. 
When summer comes, everyone will start coming back, and summer is just around the corner. 
...Yeah. 
Hee hee! I think I feel a little better after talking with you, Mon Frère! 
OK, I'm gonna go now! Bye-bye! 
And here's my room. 
My new life begins today, right here. 
Go somewhere else. 
Enter. 
I can come back to my room any time. Maybe I'll go somewhere else. 
OK, time to head in. 
(What the? It's locked from the inside.) 
Hey! Is someone in there? 
Guess whooo~? 
Iris? 
Sakura? 
Iris? 
Sakura? 
Mr. Yoneda? 
That voice. Iris? 
Heheh, nope. 
Oh, so it was you, Sakura. 
I completely thought that was Iris. You're quite the actress. 
Heheheh, thank you for the compliment. 
Anyway, what are you doing in my room, Sakura? 
Well, I was cleaning it up. Come on in! 
That voice. Sakura? 
Heheh, that's right. 
Sorry, I just felt like teasing you a bit. 
But you recognized my voice even though I was imitating Iris. 
Of course, I know your voice. 
Thank you. Eheh, that makes me happy to hear. 
That voice, Mr. Yoneda? 
Wh... What?! 
Oh, so it was you, Sakura. 
Don't give me that! I can't believe you'd mistake me for Mr. Yoneda of all people. 
I-I was just kidding. There's no way I'd mistake your voice for his. 
A-Anyway, what are you doing in my room, Sakura? 
Heheh, I guess I am kind of glad I was able to fool you. 
Well, I was cleaning your room. Come on in! 
Time's up! Too bad. 
Oh, so it was you, Sakura. 
Heheheh, sorry. I just felt like teasing you a bit. 
Anyway, what are you doing in my room, Sakura? 
Well, I was cleaning it up. Come on in! 
Wow, it's just like the way I left it. 
I aired out your futon and polished up the floor until it shined. 
Thank you, Sakura. 
Ogami... 
... 
I'm hopeless. I know I just said that we shouldn't act like lovers... 
...but when I'm around you, I get so excited… I'm sorry. 
Sakura... 
Ogami... 
Sakura... 
I... I should be going. 
W-Well then, please excuse me. 
Oh, of course. See you later, Sakura. 
Sakura... 
Starting today, this will be my room. 
I wish I could take it easy, but I need to go visit the manager's office first. 
Hey. Mon. Frère! <br> What're you up to? 
Hello, Iris. I'm just taking a walk around the theater. 
Hey, hey, you should talk to me, then! 
(Her hair is a little unruly, but it's a lovely golden blonde.) 
Mon Frère, is there something wrong with my hair? 
No, not at all. I was only thinking about how pretty it looks. 
Hee hee, thanks! Yaaay, Mon Frère complimented me!! 
I think your hair is cool, too! 
(Iris's huge ribbon is an iconic part of her look.) 
Isn't my ribbon cute? 
It is. That ribbon really suits you, Iris. 
Thank you, Mon Frère. Hearing you say that makes me really happy! 
(I wouldn't mind seeing Iris without her ribbon, too.) 
(Such pretty blue eyes. She looks just like a doll.) 
What is it, Mon Frère? You've been staring into my eyes for a while now. 
Ooh, I know! You wanna have a staring contest, right? OK, let's do it! Ready? Go! 
Hmmm...
(These cute clothes are just Iris's style.) 
Since I turned 11, I've gotten taller! 
So Sakura fixed up my clothes to make them fit me better. 
(Oh, come on, Ogami! What are you looking at?!) 
Mon Frère, what were you looking at just now?! 
Uh, I just... Hahaha... Sorry. 
If you did that with Maria or one of the other girls, they'd be really mad! 
(I never learn, do I... Man, I feel pathetic.) 
You're always with Jean-Paul, aren't you, Iris? 
Yup! Jean-Paul has been with me ever since I lived in France! 
Oh, right! Mon Frère, don't forget to say hello to him, too. 
Of course... 
Speak to him. 
Shake his paw. 
It's a pleasure to work with you again, Jean-Paul. 
Hee hee! Thanks, Mon Frère! 
I'm sure Jean-Paul is pleased, too! 
All right, Jean-Paul, how about a handshake? 
Let's both do our best to help Iris from here on out. 
Thanks, Mon Frère! 
How nice, Jean-Paul! Mon Frère shook your paw! 
What's wrong, Mon Frère? Here, come say hello to Jean-Paul, too! 
Uh, r-right... <br> Hello, Jean-Paul. 
If you don't get it together, then Jean-Paul will laugh at you, Mon Frère! 
You and Jean-Paul are really close, aren't you? 
Yup! But you don't need to worry, Mon Frère. 
Jean-Paul may be my friend, but you're still my boyfriend! 
So make sure to get along with him, OK? 
What are you looking at, Mon Frère? 
You keep looking away, Mon Frère! Are you tired of talking to me? 
N-No, that's not the case at all. 
(If I look away again, it'll make her angry. I'd better be careful.) 
Well, I'd better get going, Iris. 
What? You're leaving already? Come on, stay and talk with me for a little longer! 
Hey, Mon Frère. How do you like the new stuff we did to the theater? 
I haven't been around to every room yet, but it seems like you updated all kinds of things. 
Yeah! I really wanna dance on the new stage! 
We're gonna get a whooole lot of customers... 
So I bet your ticket punching job will get pretty hard. 
O-Oh, that's right. I do have to go back to punching tickets, don't I... 
I bet that might be kinda hard, since you haven't done it for a whole year. 
We all have to do rehearsals for our plays, so maybe you can rehearse for your job too. 
OK, I'm gonna go now. Bye-bye, Mon Frère! 
Rehearse for ticket punching, huh? Well, it has been a pretty long time. 
Though at the rate things are going, I'm gonna get roped into doing all sorts of odd jobs again... 
A game room. This place looks pretty new. 
There's even a pool table? Wow, this is the real thing. 
Oh, Sakura! Are you done getting ready? 
I still have a bit more to do. How about you, Iris? 
Those voices, is that Sakura and Iris? 
It kind of sounds like... someone's talking in the salon next door. 
I'm almost finished. Do you want some help, Sakura? 
Thanks, Iris. But I've only got a little bit left, so don't worry about it. 
Hee hee! Mon Frère is really back, huh? 
I'm so happy that... I'm gonna cry again. 
Iris... 
Say something. 
Were you two talking about me just now? 
O-Ogami?! 
Mon Frère, were you... listening to us? 
No, I couldn't hear you all that well. What were you talking about? 
O-Oh, nothing much. 
Iris, shouldn't we get going? 
Y-Yeah. Bye, Mon Frère! 
Hey, you two... <br> And they're gone. 
Oh well, I suppose I'll head somewhere else. 
(Maybe I'll stay here.) 
Mon Frère, he's really cool, and super-duper nice. 
Yes, he is. I... feel the same way. 
Well, why don't we both do our best to get things ready for him? 
Y-Yeah. 
OK, I'm gonna go now. Keep up the good work, Sakura! 
Thanks, Iris. See you later. 
... 
I don't have time to hang around here. I need to head to the manager's office. 
Huh? I wonder whose room this is. 
No answer. It must be unoccupied. 
There's no point in wasting time here. I should get moving. 
This must be Sakura's room. I wonder if she's here. 
Looks like she's not in. 
Since Sakura's not here, I should go someplace else. 
It's just like Sakura to have a cute nameplate like this. 
It's Kanna's room. I guess she's still in Okinawa doing karate training. 
It's not like she's here, anyway. 
There's no reason to hang around since Kanna's gone. I'll go somewhere else. 
A nametag is hanging on the door, almost as if it's standing guard over Kanna's room in her absence. 
There's no nameplate on the door. I wonder whose room this is. 
No answer. It must be unoccupied. 
There's no point in wasting time here. I should get moving. 
This is Maria's room. Apparently she's in America, escorting Count Hanakoji. 
It's not like she's here, anyway. 
There's no reason to hang around since Maria's gone. I'll go somewhere else. 
It's Maria's nameplate. 
Here's Iris's room. 
Hey, Iris! 
No response. I guess she's not here. 
I'm running short on time, so I should get going soon. 
So Iris's nameplate is shaped like Jean-Paul. 
This is Kohran's room. If I remember correctly, she's at the Hanayashiki Branch at the moment. 
It's not like she's here, anyway. 
Guess I'll leave. No reason to be here if Kohran's not in. 
A gear-shaped nameplate, huh? It's just Kohran's style. 
This is Sumire's room. Seems like she went back to her family home for the time being. 
Well, she's not exactly here right now. 
I'm almost out of time, so I'd better get going. 
This is a pretty subtle design, considering it's Sumire. 
I believe this used to be Ayame’s room... 
Ayame... I've come back to the theater again. 
I may make a lot of mistakes at first, but... I'll give it my all. 
I’ll try my best so you won’t have to tell me to “keep it together.” 
... 
All right, I guess I should get going. 
I should go. I need to be heading to the manager's office about now. 
No one's using this room right now. 
I should go. I need to be heading to the manager's office about now. 
This must be the library. Maybe I'll come back here and relax with a book once I've got some free time. 
But for now, I should head to the manager's office. 
This is where everyone comes to relax. I remember Sumire often visiting this room to drink tea.
No one's around. Too bad, guess I'll head somewhere else. 
This is the entrance to the second floor seating. There's always a ton of patrons here during plays.
It's pretty empty right now, though. No reason to stay here, so I'll go somewhere else. 
You can see the street out in front of the theater from this terrace. It's awash in spring sunshine. 
This is the perfect weather for sunbathing, but I can't hang around here for long. 
Looking out over the cityscape like this, it's finally starting to hit me that I've returned. 
OK, I'd better get moving. Going to the manager's office is my top priority right now. 
Of course a theater as big as this one would have second-floor seating. 
I'm willing to bet that the stage looks a bit different from up here. 
This must be the theater's attic. The air is pretty chilly up here, and it's really quiet. 
Obviously there's no one here. I should head back. 
There's no one here. No one but mice, I'd bet. 
I should get going. I don't have time to dawdle. 
All right, time to go meet the manager. 
I should go meet with the manager first. 
It's Ogami. Are you in, Mr. Yoneda? 
Ah, Ogami? Come in. 
Yes, sir. Pardon me! 
Today at 1200, I, Ichiro Ogami, newly reinstated to the Assault Troupe, am reporting for duty! 
You're here awfully early. You couldn't have greeted everyone by now, could you? 
Oho, you're here right on time. Nicely done. 
You numbskull! 12 o'clock came and went a long time ago! 
I-I'm sorry. I was wandering around the theater and the time got away from me. 
Good grief, late on your first day. You're hopeless. 
Now then, Ogami. From today on, you'll be serving as the Flower Division's captain at the theater. 
The girls of the Flower Division normally live and perform here as members of the troupe. 
However, when trouble arises, they launch into battle as members of a special combat unit. 
Its captain carries a great weight. You must both work at the theater and serve as commander in battle.
I'm sure you're overjoyed to be back with the Flower Division, but make sure to keep your wits about you. 
Yes, sir. Understood! 
Right, that's all. Oh, wait... You stand out like a sore thumb in that Navy uniform. 
Here, change into this when you get to your room. 
Whoa, these clothes bring back some memories. 
I think it's finally starting to hit me that I'm captain of the Flower Division again. 
Wahaha! Is that right? In that case, I'm glad I kept that outfit around. 
Well then, I'm going to go change. Please excuse me. 
Understood. I'm finally going back to work as captain of the Flower Division. 
Well then, I'm going to go change. Please excuse me. 
Oh, Sakura... And Iris, too. What are you both doing? 
We waited here until you were done talking. 
Come to think of it, something similar happened when I first arrived here two years ago. 
Were you two eavesdropping again, like you did back then? 
Ogami, don't tease us! We were just waiting outside, like normal. 
If you're going back to your room, would you like me to accompany you? 
No way! I can go back with him. C'mon, Mon Frère! 
Go with Sakura. 
Go with Iris. 
Go with both of them. 
OK then, let's go together, Sakura. 
Of course, I'd be happy to! 
Sorry, Iris. Sakura's going to come with me, so... 
Mon Frère, do you not like me? 
Uh, no, I... That's not... 
... 
Ogami, why don't you, me, and Iris all go together? 
How does that sound, Iris? 
...OK! 
All right then. Let's go, Ogami. 
OK then, why don't you take me there, Iris? 
OK! Come on, let's go, Mon Frère! 
Sorry Sakura, but I'm going to let Iris take me. 
That's too bad. Well, go ahead with her, then. 
She was pretty lonely without you here, after all. 
All right, Iris. Make sure you escort him safely to his room. 
Thank you, Sakura! 
OK, Mon Frère. Let us depart now! 
OK then, why don't both of you accompany me? We can all go together. 
Yeah! 
That sounds good. We're all friends, so let's go together. 
All right then. Let's go, Ogami. 
Hmm. What to do... 
Well, how about this? Iris and I can both take you to your room. 
Is that OK, Iris? 
Yeah, that's OK with me! Let's all go together! 
OK, let us depart now! 
So starting today, this'll be my room. 
Hey Mon Frère, um, we've been keeping a secret from you. 
We're holding a welcome back party for you in the dressing room! 
Huh?! A welcome back party for me? 
I'm sorry we didn't say anything until now. We wanted it to be a surprise, so we kept it a secret. 
Hee hee! I helped out a whoooole bunch! 
I see. Thank you for going to all that trouble for me. 
Well, I'm going to get changed real quick, so hold on just a minute. 
All right. Iris, let's wait outside. 
OK! We'll be waiting, so hurry and get changed! 
Well then, I guess I'd better hurry and change clothes. 
First things first, I need to take off my naval uniform. 
Get undressed in a hurry 
Get undressed carefully 
I don't want to keep Iris waiting. I'd better get changed in a hurry. 
OK, my naval uniform's off. 
We shouldn't rush things like that. I'll get changed carefully. 
OK, my naval uniform's off. 
Crap, I spaced out for a second. I can't keep them waiting; I've gotta hurry! 
OK, my naval uniform's off. 
Tie the necktie. 
Put on the shirt. 
Tie the necktie. 
Put on the shirt. 
Fold the clothes. 
OK, let's tie this necktie... 
Ack! I just realized I haven't put on my shirt yet! 
Damn it, what a waste of time! Now I've gotta untie this necktie and put my shirt on. 
OK, my shirt's on now, and I'll slip on my vest too while I'm at it. 
Oh, right. I should take a moment to fold my uniform properly. 
There, it's folded. Now to put on my shirt and vest. 
Ah... Shoot. What am I doing, standing around stark naked like this? 
I need to hurry up and get my shirt and vest on. 
All right, I've got my shirt on, and my necktie is tied. Next, I'll... 
Open the door. 
Put on pants. 
Sorry to keep you waiting! I'm done changing. 
Hm, things feel a bit drafty below my waist... 
Oh, crap! I can't believe I forgot to put on pants! 
It'd be a scandal if anyone saw me like this. I need to put them on right now! 
Hm, things feel a bit drafty below my waist... 
Ack! It looks like I haven't put on my pants yet! 
It'd be a scandal if anyone saw me like this. I need to put them on right now! 
There we go, this should be perfect. Clothes changed successfully! 
Open the door. 
Comb hair. 
Open the door. 
Sorry to keep you waiting! I'm done changing. 
Oh, wait... <br> I just finished changing, so I should comb my hair. 
There, that should do it. Sorry to keep you waiting! I'm done changing. 
Eh, that's good enough. Sorry to keep you waiting! I'm done changing. 
Mon Frère, are you done changing? 
Oooh, Mon Frère, you look so cool! 
Ogami, that outfit suits you well. 
Oh, you finished getting changed! 
You know, Ogami, that outfit really does suit you. 
Uh, Mon Frère, you're still in your underpants... 
Ack! C-Crap! 
Ahh! I-I'm so sorry! 
Iris, l-let's go back outside! 
Aw, come on, Mon Frère! Hurry up! 
Ahh jeez, I can't believe they saw me looking like that. 
Whoa! J-Just hang on a second! 
Eeeek! O-Ogami, you're still naked?! 
I-I'm in the middle of changing! 
Sheesh! You change slower than I do, Mon Frère! 
You better hurry up or I'm gonna leave! 
Oh, good grief... I give up. 
Of all the days I could've embarrassed myself like this, it had to be on my first day back. 
Huh? Mon Frère, why aren't you changed yet? 
Oh, uh... <br> I just got lost in thought. 
Come ooon! I told you to hurry up and get changed! 
Mon Frère, you dummy! If you don't go faster, I'm gonna leave! I mean it! 
*sigh* <br> I guess I've been taking my sweet time here, no matter how you slice it... 
Ah! You even folded your old clothes up! You're amazing, Mon Frère! 
That's just like you, Ogami. I'm impressed, too. 
Thanks. Well then, shall we be going? 
Oooh, you didn't fold your clothes! That's no good, Mon Frère. You need to fold them nicely. 
Oh my, Iris. You're being pretty cheeky today, aren't you? 
S-Sorry. I'll do better next time. 
But, my clothes are scattered all over the place now. 
That's true. Ogami, you really should fold them up. 
Sorry. I was in such a hurry. I'll be more careful from now on. 
Thanks for waiting. I'm all changed, so we can go anytime. 
Yaaay, let's go, let's go! We're gonna go to the dressing room. Come on, hurryyyy! 
Heheheh. Iris certainly is in high spirits. 
Hey now, Iris, don't tug my hand so hard. 
Come on already, hurry, hurry! This is your welcome back party, after all! 
Over here, Mon Frère! Go inside! 
Tah-daaahh! <br> Mon Frère has arrived! 
Wow, "Welcome to the Flower Division." Incredible! You've all done a great job of decorating this room. 
Mon Frère, over here! Look, this is your seat. 
Ehem, now then. Here's to welcoming Ichiro Ogami back into the Flower Division. 
Cheers! 
Hoorayyy! <br> Now Mon Frère and I can be together allll the time! 
Ogami. 
Welcome back... 
...to the Imperial Theater!! 
We all look forward to working alongside you from here on, Ogami. 
Thank you, everyone. Let's all work hard together as members of the Imperial Assault Troupe. 
All right, that's enough of the formalities for now. Let's drink! 
I'll have plenty of busywork to put you to starting tomorrow. 
But tonight's for lettin' yer hair down! Have a little fun! Wahahaha! 
Oh, shoot, I nearly forgot something important. 
I better tell you all before I get too drunk. 
What is it, sir? 
Truth is, we've got another new member joining us today besides Ogami. 
Huh? Really?! 
She's a 17 year old girl from Italy. I hope you'll all get along with her. 
Really?! So the Flower Division is gaining a new member! 
What do you think she's like, Ogami? I'm excited to meet her. 
I bet she'll be strange… 
Let's try to be friendly. 
I hope she's cute. 
I wonder. If she's joining the Flower Division, I bet she'll be a strange one... 
...Ogami, are you implying that the rest of us are strange, too? 
Hey, I'm not strange! 
Huh?! No, that's not what I meant... 
She just arrived in Japan, so there must be a lot that is unfamiliar to her. We should try to help her out. 
That's true. When I first came here from Sendai, I was pretty nervous, myself. 
Teamwork is more important than anything in the Flower Division, so let's try to get along with her. 
A 17 year old girl... <br> I hope she's cute. 
Ogami, just what do you mean by that? 
Oh, uh... <br> W-Well, as captain... 
Oh, forget it! 
(Whoops, guess that was too frivolous for my own good.) 
I wonder what she's like; I can't even begin to guess. 
Me either. I hope we'll be able to get along. 
All right, everybody, let me introduce our new recruit. 
This is Orihime Soletta, the newest member of the Flower Division. 
Ciao! <br> I am Orihime Soletta. <br> Pleased to meet you all. 
Call me Orihime, if you please. 
The Soletta family are distinguished throughout Italy, where they are known as the “Red Nobles.”
That's right. 
Whoa, that's incredible. 
These three are Kasumi, Yuri, and Tsubaki. They do the theater's office work. 
And this is Sakura and Iris, both members of the Flower Division. 
I'm Sakura Shinguji. It's nice to meet you. 
Hello!! I'm Iris! And this is my bear, Jean-Paul. Let's be friends! 
Everyone, I am in your kind hands now! 
Finally, this is Ichiro Ogami, the captain of the Imperial Assault Troupe, Flower Division. 
Give a serious greeting. 
Give a casual greeting. 
Pleased to meet you. I'm Imperial Navy Ensign Ichiro Ogami. 
I serve as captain of the Assault Troupe's Flower Division. I look forward to working with you. 
... 
Hm? Orihime? 
Mr. Ensign, I will be frank with you. I do not like Japanese men. 
Japanese men, they are all soft, weak-willed, and shifty. 
Maybe you are the captain or what have you, but I will ask you now not to get in my way. 
O-Orihime... 
Ciao, Orihime! I'm Ensign Ichiro Ogami of the Imperial Navy. 
I just returned to the Imperial Assault Troupe today myself. I hope we'll get along. 
... 
Well then, how about a handshake for now? 
Or perhaps, like they taught us at the military academy, a kiss on the back of the hand may be better? 
...Mr. Ensign, I have never thought of Japanese men as any better than cockroaches. 
So to begin, I have a word for you: idiot! 
O-Orihime... 
... 
How sullen you are. If there is something you wish to say, then why not say it? 
Truly, the Japanese have lowly, ill-mannered, shallow men! 
All right, all right, that is enough introductions. Orihime, Ogami, both of you sit down. 
Wh-What is this? The floor is made out of grass?! 
Heheh, I suppose you wouldn't know since you're from Italy. 
This is called "tatami." It's a part of Japanese culture. 
Hmph, so the Japanese live their lives on top of grass. How strange. 
This theater is run-down, and it all feels so very shabby! 
Ahh, it makes me long for the elegant splendor of the Roman theater! 
Ooh, Orihime, you've been to the theater in Rome? 
That’s right. Not just Rome, but many famous theaters all throughout Europe!
And all of them, always filled to the brim with guests far and wide. 
Wow, that's incredible. 
Well, I'm sure there must be a lot of things you don't know since you only just arrived in Japan. 
I'm always willing to lend a helping hand, so if you have any questions, just ask. 
Hmmm. A helping hand, you say? 
I will be returning now to my room! 
I cannot be bothered with any more of this. 
O-Orihime! What's the matter?! 
Hmph, nothing much. Being here has simply bored me is all, and so I'm going back. 
O-Orihime, wait a second! 
If I said something to offend you, I apologize. 
Humph, speaking to a Japanese man any longer than this is only a waste of my time. 
Now, I will be on my way. 
(O-Orihime!) 
Call out to her. 
Chase after her. 
Call out to her. 
Orihimeeee! 
... 
It's no good; she's already gone. 
Ogami, what in the world is going on with Orihime? 
Hmm... 
(Good grief. I only just returned to the theater, and things are already off to a bad start.) 
Sorry, everyone, I'm going after her. 
Of course. Don't mind us, Ogami, just see to Orihime for now! 
Thanks. I'll be back. 
Orihime! Just wait a minute! 
Oh my, Mr. Ensign? <br> You chased me all this way? 
O-Of course. Starting today, you're a part of the Flower Division, after all. 
I-I'm not entirely sure what I did to offend you... 
But everyone was pretty worried after you got angry and stormed off like that. 
Mr. Ensign, I would not like for you to misunderstand. 
I do not have any intention of becoming a part of the Flower Division! 
Huh?! 
In fact, none of you are worthy of more than playing the foil to my stardom! 
Wh-What'd you say?! 
Hoho... And Mr. Ensign, when it comes to Japanese men such as yourself... 
The thought of hanging around you gives me pelle d'oca, goosebumps!
You are like the rainy season of Japan. I would prefer you to not follow me around! 
Ah, Orihime! 
(Good grief. I only just returned to the theater, and things are already off to a bad start.) 
Ogami, are you sure you shouldn't go after her? 
Ah, I wouldn't be able to catch up with her now, anyway. 
I suppose, but even so... 
Ogami, what in the world is going on with Orihime? 
Hmm... 
(Good grief, I only just returned to the theater, and things are already off to a bad start.) 
Sorry Ogami, but customers are only allowed to purchase one of each bromide. 
I see. That's too bad. 
So sorry, Mr. Ogami, but customers are only allowed to purchase one of each bromide.
Oh, really? That's too bad. 
The jewel of the Pandemonium Regalia, entrusted to us by the Rose Division.
