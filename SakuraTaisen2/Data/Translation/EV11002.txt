We're taking back the Regalia, Demon King!
If you want the Regalia… then come, and prove you can claim them.
Wh-What power! <br> If we're not careful, we could get blown away!!
Urgh… <br> Is that all you've got?!
Oh-ho…
Sakura, no! Don't risk it!
We won't let you… take the Regalia!
Heheheh…
Sakura!!
I… I did it!
Impressive… <br> You managed… <br> to land a blow on me…
Sakura, don't let your guard down!!
Even without the Regalia, so long as I take the life of Sakura Shinguji, it's the same in the end.
…!
I won't let you! <br> I'll protect Sakura with everything I've got!
If that resolve of yours is true, then come to our base in Akasaka.
There we'll settle things once and for all.
…Akasaka, huh?
