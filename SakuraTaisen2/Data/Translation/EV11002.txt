We're taking back the Regalia, Demon King!
If you want them…then come, and prove you can claim them.
Wh-What power! If we're not careful, we could get blown away!!
Urgh… Is that all you've got?!
Oh-ho…
Sakura, no! Don't risk it!
We won't let you… take the Regalia!
Heheheh…
Sakura!!
I… I did it!
Impressive… <br> You managed… <br> To land a blow on me…
Sakura, don't let your guard down!!
Even without the Regalia, so long as I take the life of Sakura Shinguji, it's the same in the end.
…!
I won't let you! I'll protect Sakura with everything I've got!
If that resolve of yours is true, then come to our base in Akasaka.
There we'll settle things once and for all.
…Akasaka, huh?
