Mr. Ensign, why didn't you bring me along with you?
Well, you see…
You're too important to me…
I wanted you to lead them. 
You're too important to me, Orihime.
I couldn't bear to let anything bad happen to you.
Oh, M-Mr. Ensign! What are you talking about?
Do you really believe some unfortunate fate could befall ME, of all people?
I am thinking this concern of yours is quite uncalled-for!
Mm hm hm! Still though, knowing you worry for me isn't all that bad.
Why don't you leave things here to me!
OK, thanks, Orihime. I'm counting on you.
I knew that if I left the second squad in your command, I'd have nothing to worry about.
Ohhh, so that's what it was!
Why, you could have saved me such trouble by telling me in the first place!
Hahaha, sorry about that.
Well then, I will handle things here. You'd better give it your best, too!
OK, thanks, Orihime. I'm counting on you.
Um, no reason in particular, I guess…
Huh? Just what is going through that head of yours, Mr. Ensign?!
Then you didn't have any real reason to put me in the second squad?
N-No, that's not it. Sorry, Orihime.
Well, it is little matter. I forgive you!
I will handle things here. You'd better give it your best, too!
OK, thanks, Orihime. I'm counting on you.
