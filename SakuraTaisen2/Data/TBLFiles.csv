EV00002,1,OK, we finished them. If I remember, those are the Hex Mechs that called, "Wakiji."
EV00002,2,Which means, if they show up again in Tokyo...
EV00051,1,Hold it, Ensign! I thought I had told you to keep yourself away from me!
EV00051,2,Huhh?!
EV00051,3,Mamma mia, you Japanese men are nastier than cockroaches! Shoo, shoo!
EV00051,4,Oh, come on...
EV01002,1,Okay, 
EV01020,1,Ogami! Soaring Whale is ready to launch attack!
EV01020,2,OK! Do it!
EV01020,3,Mission accomplished! We did it, Ogami!
EV01020,4,Thanks, Tsubaki!
EV01020,5,Yeah! The Soaring Whale will return to holding. Keep it up!
EV01021,1,Ogami, the Soaring Whale is ready to drop the Steam Stand!
EV01021,2,OK! Please do!
EV01021,3,Mission accomplished!
EV01021,4,Ogami, you can use the Steam Stand to recharge the Koubu's power.
EV01021,5,You just need to step on it after launch one attack.
EV01021,6,Got it. Thanks, Tsubaki!
EV01021,7,Yeah! The Soaring Whale will return to holding. Keep it up!
EV01022,1,To think that you'd consider an attack from the air, that was quite a feat, Ensign.
EV01022,2,Attack is the biggest part of defense, after all. Let's keep at it, Orihime.
EV01022,3,Well, do your best not to get in my way!
EV01022,4,Hahaha...
EV01023,1,Way to go, Mon Frère! You even thinking about restoring our power.
EV01023,2,Hahaha, you can't fight with an empty stomach.
EV01023,3,Tee-hee! I'll do my best too!
EV01030,1,This many artilleries... Despite riding Koubu, it'll be dangerous to get directly hit by them.
EV01030,2,In that case, you can use "Captain Commands"!
EV01030,3,Well, it does sounds quite fun to use "Fire" formation that emphasizes attack.
EV01030,4,But using "Mountain" formation so that we can still keep going despite receiving blows is also great.
EV01030,5,But please be careful. You can only use Captain Commands during your turn.
EV01030,6,Okay. I'll give commands carefully with the "Captain" option to advantage our battles.
EV01050,1,Reni, how's your condition?
EV01050,2,Not bad.
EV01050,3,O-OK... So, Reni... 
EV01050,4,How should we attack?
EV01050,5,What do you think about that flower?
EV01050,6,How should we attack? I wanna hear your thoughts.
EV01050,7,The enemy intends to block our advance with long-range artillery.
EV01050,8,So, I'm going to destroy the artillery from behind. When the enemy's attention is diverted, we can all rush in.
EV01050,9,An ambush that doubles as a diversion, huh? I see...
EV01050,10,But doing it alone would be too dangerous.
EV01050,11,I'm fine with it. Working with another person would rather be a nuisance. 
EV01050,12,Got it, just don't do anything reckless.
EV01050,13,I won't. It's just something that I can do.
EV01050,14,What do you think about that flower, Reni?
EV01050,15,A vine plant in the family Fabaceae, Wisteria floribunda, or Japanese wisteria.
EV01050,16,...
EV01050,17,U-Uh... That's not what I'm asking... 
EV01050,18,Aren't they beautiful? Even though we're at the battlefield, I think... 
EV01050,19,...Is that all?
EV01050,20,N-No...
EV01050,21,I'm cutting off the transmission.
EV01050,22,H-Hey, Reni... Right, we're in the middle of battling, of course there's no way we can talk about flowers.
EV01050,23,...
EV01050,24,If you have nothing to discuss, I'm cutting off the transmission.
EV01050,25,Ah, Reni! Ah... She cut the transmission.
EV01054,1,Ogami, should we change our battle strategy?
EV01054,2,Let's go with the Wind strategy!
EV01054,3,Let's go with the Mountain strategy!
EV01054,4,Let's keep it like this.
EV01054,5,Let's go with the Fire strategy!
EV01054,6,Let's go with the Forest strategy!
EV01054,7,Let's keep it like this.
EV01054,8,OK, let's go with the Wind strategy!
EV01054,9,Roger!
EV01054,10,OK, let's go with the Fire strategy!
EV01054,11,Roger!
EV01054,12,OK, Let's go with the Forest strategy!
EV01054,13,Roger!
EV01054,14,OK, let's go with the Mountain strategy!
EV01054,15,Roger!
EV01054,16,No, let's just keep it like this.
EV01054,17,Yes, sir! Understood!
EV01054,18,...No. I think we should keep going with our current formation.
EV01054,19,Yes, sir! Understood.
EV01055,1,Reni is so awesome, Mon Frère!
EV01055,2,The Star Division has lots of great people.
EV01055,3,You're right.
EV01055,4,But I think you're just as awesome!
EV01055,5,You just finished five of the enemies, right?
EV01055,6,Act cool to answer
EV01055,7,Brag a little
EV01055,8,Well...
EV01055,9,You're kind of classy, Mon Frère! I like that!
EV01055,10,Well...
EV01055,11,What's wrong, Mon Frère? That's not like you... 
EV01055,12,(Was I always act diligent?)
EV01055,13,Well, I AM awesome. Right, Iris?
EV01055,14,What's wrong? Do you want to win from Reni so bad?
EV01055,15,It's not like you to brag yourself like that, Mon Frère.
EV01055,16,(Is it? Am I being too aware with Reni's action?)
EV01055,17,Well, I AM awesome. Right, Iris?
EV01055,18,Tee-hee! You're just being cheerful like usual, Mon Frère!
EV01055,19,I'm gonna work hard too! I won't lose to Reni!
EV01055,20,Yaaay!!
EV01055,21,Right, Iris. Let's do our best too to keep up with Reni.
EV01055,22,Yeah!
EV02001,1,It's just like the intel we got! Now let's finish this in instant and go straight home!
EV02001,2,OK! We're gonna destroy all of the enemy's material. Let's go, everyone!!
EV02002,1,OK, now the enemies won't be able to build their base.
EV02002,2,Good job, everyone. We're gonna wipe the enemies next.
EV02021,1,Mon Frère, I wonder if my letter can reach them... 
EV02021,2,Of course it will, Iris.
EV02021,3,You wrote it.
EV02021,4,It's filled with my thoughts.
EV02021,5,You wrote it with all your heart...
EV02021,6,I'm sure it'll reach your parents.
EV02021,7,Yeah.
EV02021,8,Because it's filled with my thoughts... My thoughts about you... 
EV02021,9,Mon Frère... 
EV02021,10,As long as Manager Yoneda not trip himself, I'm sure it'll reach your parents.
EV02021,11,Yeah, you're right!
EV02021,12,Let's finish this battle quickly so your papa and mama don't need to worry.
EV02021,13,Yeah. It'll be OK. I have you... and everyone with me!
EV02025,1,Way to go, Ensign! The enemies hasn't fully prepared themselves!
EV02025,2,OK, Orihime! Let's attack them while we can!
EV02025,3,OK, let's do it!
EV02050,1,Look out! Some of the containers have enemies inside!
EV02050,2,Though we can't just ignore any of them, either...
EV02050,3,I guess we'll just have to steel ourselves as we break each one.
EV02051,1,Looks like they've got compressed steam canisters in some of these containers. The enemy's well prepared.
EV02051,2,We can't expect all of them to have these, though. We have to be careful.
EV02052,1,All right, 3 more to go!
EV02052,2,We did it, Ogami! 3 more left!
EV02052,3,Hooray! 3 more to go, Mon Frère.
EV02052,4,3 are left now! How simple this is!
EV02052,5,Target destroyed. 3 remaining...
EV02053,1,Just 2 left! Let's do this!
EV02053,2,There's 2 left! Let's keep going, Ogami!
EV02053,3,Kyahaha! 2 more left!
EV02053,4,2 are left! All of you, please be quiet and watch me!
EV02053,5,Target destroyed. 2 remaining...
EV02054,1,Only one that's left! We got close!
EV02054,2,Way to go! There's only one left, Ogami!
EV02054,3,Yay, hooray! There's only one left, Mon Frère!
EV02054,4,There's only one left! Show them a splendid finale!
EV02054,5,Target destroyed... One target remaining...
EV03002,1,OK, we got this!
EV03002,2,Great work, Ogami. All that's left is their leader. Don't lower your guard, OK?
EV03002,3,Understood. Let's go, everyone!
EV03002,4,Ogami, the people in the Kanzaki Mansion has been evacuated.
EV03002,5,The evacuation has completed? Understood.
EV03002,6,Time to do counterattack, everyone! Let's go!
EV03005,1,Captain, your orders today are too soft.
EV03005,2,I-Is that so? Sorry, I just learned that you're a girl...
EV03005,3,Untranslated
EV03005,4,Untranslated
EV03005,5,I can still fight more. Consider an efficient way to direct your members with each abilities respectively.
EV03005,6,G-Got it...
EV03020,1,Can you hear me, Ogami? Enemies are start to penetrate inside one by one.
EV03020,2,Anyway, destroy the enemies in the mansion. I'm counting on you.
EV03020,3,Roger, ma'am!
EV03021,1,Can you really blame me for being worried after getting a call like that?
EV03021,2,Besides, I thought it was odd that you'd let yourself get married off for our financial backing.
EV03021,3,My, whatever do you mean? I know nothing of this financial backing you speak of.
EV03021,4,Besides, going through an arranged marriage like that proved to be a valuable experience.
EV03021,5,You're a poor liar.
EV03021,6,That's great.
EV03021,7,Maybe I should get married too?
EV03021,8,You're a poor liar. I know how you really feel about the Flower Division.
EV03021,9,Goodness, I haven't the faintest idea what you're talking about.
EV03021,10,Well, you are free to think whatever you please.
EV03021,11,That's great, Sumire.
EV03021,12,Wh-What did you say?! You truly are dense...
EV03021,13,What are you getting angry for?! You just said it was a valuable experience!
EV03021,14,Oh, never mind!
EV03021,15,Hmm, an arranged marriage, huh? Maybe I should give that a shot too.
EV03021,16,Ohohoho, getting arranged to be wed with me? Such lofty ambitions.
EV03021,17,I-I never said anything about marrying YOU, Sumire...
EV03021,18,...O-Oh, really, now? Oho... Ohohoho...
EV03021,19,...
EV03021,20,Oh my, I apologize if I've offended you somehow.
EV03021,21,At any rate, I am the top star of the Imperial Theater, after all.
EV03021,22,None of you in the Flower Division can bear to be without me...
EV03021,23,Nor can all of my eagerly awaiting fans! Ah, what a sad fate mine is.
EV03021,24,...Ha, hahaha... R-Right.
EV03021,25,OK, Sumire, let's get going. Ending the call.
EV03021,26,Very well...
EV03021,27,Ensign...<br>Thank you...<br>I...
EV03021,28,Hm? Did you say something just now, Sumire?
EV03021,29,E-Ensign?! I thought you ended the call?
EV03021,30,Not yet. I didn't quite hear that. You sure you didn't say something?
EV03021,31,N-No, I didn't say a word!
EV03021,32,Now then, let's end this prattling and be on our way!
EV03021,33,Right!
EV03023,1,Isn't great we were able to bring Sumire back, Kanna?
EV03023,2,Heh! Not like I really cared about that cactus woman, but better safe than sorry, I guess...
EV03023,3,B-by the way, Boss... If I was ever gettin' married off like that, would you come to my rescue, too?
EV03023,4,Of course!
EV03023,5,I'd rescue the groom.
EV03023,6,Untranslated
EV03023,7,I'd rescue the groom.
EV03023,8,Of course I would! If you're ever in trouble, I'll be there, no matter where you are!
EV03023,9,Heheh... Geez, you're makin' me blush.
EV03023,10,All right, now I'm fired up! Let's do this, Boss!
EV03023,12,What are you sayin', Boss? Man, you really don't get women.
EV03023,14,Oh... Sorry.
EV03023,15,Eh, whatever. I'd just want you to show up, is all.
EV03023,16,OK, let's do this, Boss!
EV03023,17,I think I'd be the saving the groom from you. Wouldn't want you to hurt the guy.
EV03023,18,Wh-what's that supposed to mean?!
EV03023,19,Well if you were forced to be wed to someone, I know you'd punch his lights out and run.
EV03023,20,Hey, I can behave myself too, sometimes. That's when you'd have to come rescue me.
EV03023,21,Eh, whatever. Let's do this, Boss!
EV03023,22,Well... Even if you were there to rescue the groom, I'd just want you to show up at all.
EV03023,23,...
EV03023,24,C'mon, Boss, you don't need to think that hard about it.
EV03023,25,R-right, I'm just having a hard time imagining you stuck in an arranged marriage.
EV03023,29,All right, now I'm fired up! Let's do this, Boss!
EV03024,1,These drones are dreadfully weak. Why don't you come over here and face us yourself?
EV03024,2,Or could it be you're too afraid of losing to move from that spot?
EV03024,3,Grr!! How dare a lowly human like you make a mockery of me!!
EV03024,4,Ohohohoho, I seem to have struck a nerve. Well, I can't say I blame you after witnessing my strength.
EV03024,5,Wow, Sumire. Looks like...
EV03024,6,You haven't lost your skill.
EV03024,7,You haven't lost your bite.
EV03024,8,Looks like you haven't lost your skill. Have you been training?
EV03024,9,What are you implying? A natural talent such as myself has no need of training.
EV03024,10,Looks like you haven't lost your bite. There's the Sumire I know.
EV03024,11,Do you mean to imply you think of me as caustic, Ensign?
EV03024,12,O-Of course not...
EV03024,13,...
EV03024,14,What's the matter, Ensign? You seem to have your head in the clouds.
EV03024,15,Uh, nothing... You're just so gorgeous, I didn't know what to say.
EV03024,16,Hmph, obviously. Everything I do, I do so gorgeously.
EV03024,17,W-Well at any rate, looking forward to having you back on the team, Sumire.
EV03024,18,Indeed, I can't wait to show the others how it's done! Ohohohoho!
EV03024,19,(Good grief...)
EV03025,1,That's it, Ogami. Keep it up.
EV03025,2,Are you all right, Ogami? Don't overdo it.
EV03025,3,Yes, ma'am.
EV03025,4,(Kaede... She's the spitting image of her sister, Ayame...)
EV03025,5,(Urgh... Ayame...)
EV03025,6,What's wrong, Ogami?
EV03025,7,N-Nothing at all, ma'am! I'll do my best!
EV03051,1,Yo, Sumire! Glad to have ya back, but you haven't gotten rusty on us, right?
EV03051,2,Well, Kanna, have you tried a more dignified manner of fighting than sheer brute force?
EV03051,3,What didja say?!
EV03051,4,What of it?!
EV03051,5,Hey, now...
EV03051,6,All right, then, how 'bout this?
EV03051,7,Let's see who can take down the most enemies in just two moves! We'll make it a contest!
EV03051,8,How amusing.<br>I accept!
EV03051,9,Hey Boss! We'll need ya to keep track for us, so look sharp!
EV03051,10,Ensign! You haven't seen my dance in a long time, so prepare to feast your eyes!
EV03051,11,*sigh* Oh, brother.
EV03052,1,Tsch! I didn't even get to take any of 'em down...
EV03052,2,What a disgrace, making me fight such riff-raff!
EV03052,3,All right, then, let's do it over again! We'll settle the score once and for all!
EV03052,4,How do ya like that, Sumire? Now you know the difference in our skill!
EV03052,5,Hmph! I was merely distracted, that's all!
EV03052,6,Were it not for that, I wouldn't have had any trouble with such riff-raff.
EV03052,7,Aw, quit talkin' crap! Fine, then, let's go one more round!!
EV03052,8,Ohhhohoho! It seems I have won. Well, it's only natural, I suppose.
EV03052,9,D-Dammit! That was a fluke! Let's go one more time!!
EV03052,10,Ohohoho, no matter how many times we do this, the end result shall be the same.
EV03052,11,It seems... we have reached a tie.
EV03052,12,That... wasn't satisfying at all.
EV03052,13,C'mon, Sumire, how 'bout another round?
EV03052,14,H-Hang on, you two. Aren't you forgetting who it is we're supposed to be fighting?
EV03052,15,We have to foil the Black Demon Society's plans and keep the civilians safe. That's our job, remember?
EV03052,16,Besides, getting to fight alongside you two is more than enough for me.
EV03052,17,O-Oh...
EV03052,18,Well, if you insist, Ensign...
EV03052,19,All right, it's settled, then. Let's go, you two!
EV03052,20,As you wish! This time we'll see who the true victor is!
EV03053,1,Hey Mon Frère, do you want us to keep fighting like this?
EV03053,2,Maybe we should try fighting in a way that won't get everyone hurt!
EV03053,3,But maybe we should fight with our normal strength instead...
EV03053,4,OK, let's go with the Mountain strategy!
EV03053,5,OK, Let's go with the Forest strategy!
EV03053,6,Let's keep it like this.
EV03053,7,OK, let's go with the Mountain strategy!
EV03053,8,OK, now everyone can fight without worrying!
EV03053,9,OK, Let's go with the Forest strategy!
EV03053,10,OK, if we don't overdo it, then we can stay out of danger!
EV03053,11,No, let's just keep it like this.
EV03053,12,OK, if that's what you think, Mon Frère, then I'm sure that's the right choice.
EV03053,13,...No, let's stick with the current strategy.
EV03053,14,OK, then we'll keep going with the strategy we're using now!
EV04001,1,...Mr. Yamaguchi!
EV04001,2,Oh, is that you? The youngster from before?
EV04001,3,We'll defend your vehicle, sir. Get away to a safe location while we hold them off.
EV04001,4,Relax, pops, it's fine. Just leave everything to us.
EV04001,5,Right, if you insist, then I'll do as you say. I'm counting on you.
EV04001,6,Yes, sir! All you have to do is trust us.
EV04001,7,By the way, Chief, about that safe location...
EV04001,8,Pops here will need to go to that spot over there.
EV04001,9,You got that, Chief? We can't let any enemies get close!
EV04001,10,Roger!<br>OK, everyone, let's go!
EV04001,11,Ah, young man!
EV04001,12,Yes?
EV04001,13,Don't do anything rash.<br>Proceed with caution.
EV04001,14,...Yes, sir!
EV04002,1,OK, Mr. Yamaguchi is safe now. All that's left is to exterminate these enemies.
EV04003,1,No! The car! Is Mr. Yamaguchi safe?
EV04003,2,No worries, Ogami. The person inside has been saved by the Moon Division.
EV04003,3,The Moon Division? So he's safe, thank goodness.
EV04003,4,We'll handle the fire incident somehow, so you only need to focus on your battle!
EV04003,5,Roger, ma'am!
EV04005,1,Your commands, Captain.
EV04005,2,O-Oh, wait a minute.
EV04005,3,Your response is slower than usual.
EV04005,4,Right, sorry.
EV04005,5,You see, I just... got aware that you're a girl.
EV04005,6,Every member in our division are girls. It's fine to give commands like you usually do.
EV04005,7,Yeah, got it... I'll do just that.
EV04020,1,Seems that the enemies are targeting that car, Ogami.
EV04020,2,I want you to exterminate them while covering that car so they won't attack it.
EV04020,3,Understood.
EV04022,1,The town's in ruins... This must be the work of Kasha's bombs.
EV04022,2,Even bombs weren't originally invented to kill people, y'know...
EV04022,3,Kohran, your inventions...
EV04022,4,Can make people happy.
EV04022,5,Are nothing but trouble.
EV04022,6,Aren't a big deal, so relax.
EV04022,7,They can make a lot of people happy. The others always have fun with your inventions, right?
EV04022,8,I-I'm so happy to hear you say that... That sorta praise is all a scientist could ever ask for.
EV04022,9,They're nothing but trouble. How many times, now, have I been victimized by your inventions?
EV04022,10,Hahaha... It's true, they do tend to blow up whenever you touch 'em.
EV04022,11,Say, you think YOU might be the reason they always do that, Chief?
EV04022,12,Eep! O-Of course not, Kohran...
EV04022,13,They're not really a big deal, so relax. They've never made me suffer enough to make me unhappy, at least.
EV04022,14,Well if you insist, Chief, then how 'bout I make you feel firsthand just how impressive my inventions can be?
EV04022,15,P-Please, anything but that...
EV04022,16,What's up, Chief? You got quiet all of a sudden.
EV04022,17,No, it's just, I never once thought inventions could make people unhappy, is all.
EV04022,18,Here's how I see it, Chief.
EV04022,19,Inventions are there to make people happy.
EV04022,20,That's why... I don't want anybody coming up with inventions to make others UNhappy.
EV04022,21,No, I'll NEVER let them be used like that!
EV04022,22,That's right. That's why we can't let Kasha get away with this.
EV04022,23,You think MY inventions could be ever used to make people unhappy, too?
EV04022,24,So long as you never forget how you feel right now, I don't think that'll be a problem.
EV04022,25,Let's do this, Kohran.
EV04022,26,Alrighty, then!<br>Let's hop to it!
EV04050,1,Ow! My foot hurts! W-What is it?
EV04050,2,Ah, I get it. I sprained my ankle when I was trying to rescue Shiro...
EV04050,3,Ah, I get it. I sprained my ankle when I was trying to rescue Hanamaru...
EV04050,4,Ah, I get it. I sprained my ankle when I was trying to rescue Dai...
EV04050,5,Ah, I get it. I sprained my ankle when I was trying to rescue Torte...
EV04050,6,Ah, I get it. I sprained my ankle when I was trying to rescue Long...
EV04050,7,Ah, I get it. I sprained my ankle when I was trying to rescue Altair...
EV04050,8,Ah, I get it. I sprained my ankle when I was trying to rescue Hund...
EV04050,9,I think this would be a problem when I'm riding Koubu.
EV04053,1,Hey Chief, I know it's been a while since we've fought together, but do you remember my Koubu's specialty?
EV04053,2,Frontal assault
EV04053,3,Rear support
EV04053,4,Self-destruction
EV04053,5,Let's see... Yours is a front-line assault type, right?
EV04053,6,Huh? What are talking about, Chief?
EV04053,7,My Koubu supports from the rear using long-range attacks. Try not to forget, OK?
EV04053,8,A rear support unit, right? Yours has to stay behind the others and provide cover.
EV04053,9,Bingo! I'm so glad you remembered!
EV04053,10,It self-destructs, right? I mean, everything you touch DOES explode.
EV04053,11,Hahaha! That was pretty harsh, Chief. Of course my Koubu won't blow up.
EV04053,12,...
EV04053,13,...You forgot, didn't'cha, Chief?
EV04053,14,...Sorry.
EV04053,15,Eh, it's okay. You'll remember after we fight for a bit.
EV04055,1,Ensign, how about we change our strategy, as a little change of pace?
EV04055,2,Dancing like a blazing flame... Yes, such a strategy sounds perfect to me.
EV04055,3,Dancing swiftly like the wind... Such a strategy could also prove to be indispensable.
EV04055,4,OK, let's go with the Fire strategy!
EV04055,5,OK, let's go with the Wind strategy!
EV04055,6,Let's keep it like this.
EV04055,7,OK, let's go with the Fire strategy!
EV04055,8,Well then, behold by fierce and beautiful dance!
EV04055,9,OK, let's go with the Wind strategy!
EV04055,10,Then watch as I dance swiftly like the howling wind! Try not to lose sight of me!
EV04055,11,No, let's just keep it like this.
EV04055,12,I see, you're enraptured with my current dance, aren't you, Ensign?
EV04055,13,...No. I think we should keep going with our current formation.
EV04055,14,Very well then, keep gazing upon my elegant dance!
EV05001,1,What did you say?!
EV05001,2,You're all trapped. Like. Rats.
EV05001,3,You've BEEN trapped since the moment you arrived. Heheheh...
EV05001,4,Go ahead and laugh while you still can! Let's go, everyone!
EV05001,5,Roger!!
EV05002,1,All right, all hostiles eliminated!
EV05002,2,Urgh, you've ruined my trap, you little pests.
EV05002,3,In that case, I'll just have to tear you all apart with my own two hands!
EV05003,1,Gahahaha!! Sorry to keep ya waitin', Suiko!
EV05003,2,Wha-- Kongo?!<br>Why are you here?!<br>I didn't call for you!
EV05003,3,What the hell ya talkin' about? You sent out that transmission, didn't ya?
EV05003,4,Transmission?<br>...Hmph, so that's what this is about.<br>I see now.
EV05003,5,I'll gladly accept these gifts. Thank you...
EV05003,6,But I'm afraid I don't have any use for you, Kongo. You're in my way.
EV05003,7,Get real! Like I'm gonna back down from a fight like this!
EV05003,8,Fine, but only if you obey my every order like a loyal little doggie. Think you can do that?
EV05003,9,Hey, don't treat me like I'm dumb! Whatever, have it your way!
EV05003,10,Hmhmhm... Not bad, tricking Kongo like that, but I'm afraid your attempts to impede him have ended in failure.
EV05003,11,Now I'll end your lives with the same reinforcements you called for.
EV05003,12,Dammit, this is gonna be tough, but we're gonna fight our way out of this!!
EV05004,1,I coulda sworn this was the rendezvous point Suiko picked out...
EV05004,2,Is this not it? Fine, we'll check somewhere else.
EV05004,3,Kongo?! Why's he here, I didn't even give him the signal!
EV05004,4,And what's more, he got lost, that idiot!
EV05004,5,All those reinforcements, gone to waste! Unbelievable!
EV05004,6,But wait... Did they know about the reinforcements too? No, there's no way...
EV05004,7,Looks like everything went according to plan. OK, just a bit more, now!
EV05005,1,Your orders, Captain.
EV05005,2,Right, Reni, you can... Actually, yeah, what should we do?
EV05005,3,...Giving clear and precise orders is a fundamental part of any operation, Captain.
EV05005,4,I know... In any case, let's wait a bit longer for the enemy to make their move.
EV05005,5,Roger.
EV05005,6,(Phew, I'm losing my composure now that I know Reni's a girl...)
EV05007,1,All right! We've driven back all the enemies!
EV05007,2,Impossible... It seems I've underestimated them.
EV05007,3,In that case, I'll just have to tear them all apart with my own two hands!
EV05010,1,Gahahaha!! Sorry to keep ya waitin', Suiko!
EV05010,2,Wha-- Kongo?!<br>Why are you here?!<br>I didn't call for you!
EV05010,3,What the hell ya talkin' about? You sent out that transmission, didn't ya?
EV05010,4,Transmission?<br>...Hmph, so that's what this is about.<br>I see now.
EV05010,5,I'll gladly accept these gifts. Thank you...
EV05010,6,But I'm afraid I don't have any use for you, Kongo. You're in my way.
EV05010,7,Get real! Like I'm gonna back down from a fight like this!
EV05010,8,Fine, but only if you obey my every order like a loyal little doggie. Think you can do that?
EV05010,9,Hey, don't treat me like I'm dumb! Whatever, have it your way!
EV05010,10,Hmhmhm... Not bad, tricking Kongo like that, but I'm afraid your attempts to impede him have ended in failure.
EV05010,11,Now I'll end your lives with the same reinforcements you called for.
EV05010,12,Dammit, this is gonna be tough, but we're gonna fight our way out of this!!
EV05018,1,That's all the lighthouses destroyed! That should keep any enemies out at sea away from us!
EV05018,2,Urgh, the enemy reinforcements are already here...
EV05018,3,Now's not the time for regrets!  We have to focus on the enemies before us!
EV05019,1,All right, how's that?!
EV05019,2,Great, we've blocked off the road with the boulder! We don't have to worry about any enemies coming from the mountains!
EV05019,3,Urgh, the enemy reinforcements are already here...
EV05019,4,Now's not the time for regrets! We have to focus on the enemies before us!
EV05020,1,It seems our long-awaited vacation's been ruined, hasn't it, Captain.
EV05020,2,Yeah... But we can come back next year.
EV05020,3,We can bring Mr. Yoneda.
EV05020,4,We'll be able to relax.
EV05020,5,It'll be just us two.
EV05020,6,["It'll be just us two." option disappears.]
EV05020,7,We could even bring Mr. Yoneda or Kaede along with us.
EV05020,8,Yes, that's right.
EV05020,9,They say the hot springs here do wonders for healing wounds. We should definitely come together next time.
EV05020,10,Right, now let's go, Maria!
EV05020,11,Yes, sir!
EV05020,12,Maybe next time we'll be able to relax a bit more.
EV05020,13,Yes, but in order for that to happen...
EV05020,14,Yeah, we'll need to bring peace to the capital before anything else.
EV05020,15,But I know we can do it!
EV05020,16,Yes, let's do our best, Captain!
EV05020,17,Next time it'll be just the two of us.
EV05020,18,...
EV05020,19,Hmhmhm, I'll think about it. Now let's get going, Captain!
EV05020,20,Yeah, Maria!
EV05020,21,Ah, but if we want to be able to relax...
EV05020,22,Yes, we'll need to bring peace to the capital first!
EV05020,23,That's right! OK, let's go, Maria!
EV05020,24,Yes, sir!
EV05022,1,Ogami! The enemy reinforcements are only 200 meters away.
EV05022,2,The situation's becoming dangerous. Be careful.
EV05022,3,200 meters away, huh? Gotta hurry...
EV05025,1,That reminds me, Ensign. Why didn't you come with us to the beach?
EV05025,2,It was your one chance to gaze upon me in my swimsuit...
EV05025,3,(Whoa... Sumire's new swimsuit, huh...?)
EV05025,4,Now thanks to the enemy, our holiday's been ruined! I won't let them get away with this!
EV05026,1,Yo, Boss! You shoulda gone hiking with us earlier.
EV05026,2,The air and the water are so clean up there, perfect for training.
EV05026,3,Hahaha, how strong will you have to get before you're satisfied?
EV05026,4,Who knows, maybe we'll find out once we beat these guys up?
EV05027,1,Well, Sakura? Were you able to enjoy the hot springs?
EV05027,2,Yes, but since it's a mixed bath, I kept worrying someone might walk in on me.
EV05027,3,What?! Looks like I'll need to check it out myself...
EV05027,4,What are you saying?! Anyway, the enemy's approaching! Let's go!
EV05051,1,We had so much fun at the beach, Mon Frère!
EV05051,2,It's too bad you didn't come with us, my swimsuit totally would've taken your breath away.
EV05051,3,Hahaha, looks like our vacation's over, though.
EV05051,4,Yeah! I can't believe they showed up here. They're gonna pay!
EV05054,1,Orihime, was the hike really that hard on you?
EV05054,2,Shut up! I hate Japanese mountains just like I hate Japanese men!
EV05054,3,Sounds like it was...
EV07001,1,Reni!
EV07001,2,Combat preparations complete.<br>Enemy straight ahead...<br>Use of force necessary.
EV07001,3,Hm hm hm hm...<br>I'm going to savor watching you fight.
EV07001,4,The curtain rises on this fatal tragedy... I can't wait to see how it plays out.
EV07001,5,Here I come, Reni!<br>I swear... I'll bring you back!
EV07001,6,I'll bring back your heart and your smile!
EV07002,1,You're...<br>My enemy...<br>So why...?
EV07002,2,Reni...
EV07002,3,Just hold on, Reni.<br>I'm coming!!
EV07003,1,Reni...
EV07003,2,The Imperial Assault Troupe has arrived!!
EV07003,3,I brought everyone along, Mon Frère!
EV07003,4,Iris filled us in on the situation, Captain.
EV07003,5,Reni's being manipulated by Saki Kageyama... Suiko...
EV07003,6,We're helpin' out too, Boss! We'll bring Reni back to her senses!
EV07003,7,No, wait... Leave Reni to me, I'll talk to her.
EV07003,8,Huh?! But Ogami, why?
EV07003,9,When Reni confided her worries to me... I didn't give her a good enough answer.
EV07003,10,So that's why... I want to save her this time!
EV07003,11,...Understood. We'll leave her in your hands, Captain.
EV07003,12,In the meantime, we'll hold the enemies off until you've talked Reni down!
EV07003,13,Mon Frère, please...<br>Please bring Reni back to her normal self...
EV07003,14,Don't worry.<br>I'll save Reni.
EV07005,1,Reni!<br>It's me, Ogami!
EV07005,2,Hostile unit entering attack range...
EV07005,3,Reni, you have to listen to me!
EV07005,4,Target acquired...<br>Use of force necessary.
EV07005,5,Hm hm hm...<br>It's no use.<br>Your words can't reach her.
EV07005,6,Urgh...
EV07005,7,I won't give up!<br>I'll get through to you, Reni!
EV07006,1,You...
EV07006,2,You're... my enemy!!<br>I must defeat you!!
EV07006,3,You won't do anything? Then here I come.
EV07007,1,Reni!<br>Don't you recognize me?!
EV07007,2,I recognize you.<br>The Imperial Assault Troupe...
EV07007,3,You are my enemy...<br>An enemy I must defeat...
EV07007,4,You cannot fool me.<br>You are... my enemy.
EV07007,5,Stop it, Reni!
EV07007,6,I'm not your enemy!
EV07007,7,Stop it, Reni!
EV07007,8,...
EV07007,9,Why aren't you... attacking me?
EV07007,10,Reni! I'm not your enemy!
EV07007,11,...
EV07007,12,Not my enemy...?<br>Then...<br>What are you?!
EV07007,13,...
EV07007,14,Why aren't you attacking me...? We are enemies.
EV07007,15,If you won't attack me... Then I'll attack you instead.
EV07007,16,...Rrgh!
EV07007,17,Attack.
EV07007,18,Reni...<br>Here I come!
EV07007,19,...
EV07007,20,Hm hm hm... Are you sure?
EV07007,21,Do you really want to hurt your precious squadmate?
EV07007,22,...Rrgh!
EV07007,23,...
EV07007,24,...
EV07007,25,...Why! Why aren't you... attacking me?! I'm your... enemy!
EV07007,26,You're wrong, Reni! We aren't enemies!
EV07007,27,If not...<br>Then...<br>Then...
EV07007,28,Then... What the hell are you?!
EV07007,29,Reni, we're...
EV07007,30,Your comrades in arms!
EV07007,31,Your partners on stage!
EV07007,32,We're your comrades in arms!
EV07007,33,Com... rades...
EV07007,34,That's right, Reni! We're comrades, in the Flower Division!
EV07007,35,Urgh... Guh...
EV07007,36,We're your partners on stage!
EV07007,37,Stage...
EV07007,38,Have you forgotten, Reni?! You rehearsed The Blue Bird with the others!
EV07007,39,We're all part of the Flower Division, remember?!
EV07007,40,Urgh... Guh...
EV07007,41,Reni, we're...
EV07007,42,Target in range, has ceased movement. Returning to combat position.
EV07007,43,Re-Reni?!
EV07008,1,...Why...<br>Aren't you... attacking?
EV07008,2,You're...<br>My cap...
EV07008,3,No! You're my enemy!<br>And I'll attack any enemy who comes near!
EV07008,4,Just...<br>Who are you?!
EV07008,5,You're my enemy!<br>And I'll attack any enemy who comes near!
EV07009,1,Reni...
EV07009,2,Why...<br>Why am I...
EV07009,3,What...<br>What the hell am I?!
EV07009,4,Reni... You're...
EV07009,5,A member of the Flower Division!
EV07009,6,Reni, you're a member of the Flower Division!
EV07009,7,A member of the Flower Division, same as us!
EV07009,8,Flower... Division...
EV07009,9,Urgh...<br>I'm... I'm...
EV07009,10,Reni... You're...
EV07009,11,I'm...
EV07009,12,Urgh...<br>I'm... I'm...
EV07020,1,Hey, Mon Frère...<br>Do you remember how Reni looked when you gave her the flower crown?
EV07020,2,She was really cute.
EV07020,3,You looked cuter.
EV07020,4,I thought it might snow.
EV07020,5,She looked really cute. I didn't think she could look like that.
EV07020,6,Uh-huh!<br>It was wonderful to see Reni smile!
EV07020,7,I actually think you looked cuter then.
EV07020,8,Are you saying you don't care that Reni smiled, Mon Frère?
EV07020,9,S-Sorry... I guess now's not the time to make jokes.
EV07020,10,Seeing Reni smile like that, I was expecting it to start snowing, too...
EV07020,11,You're so mean, Mon Frère! Reni's a girl too, you know! Watch what you're saying!
EV07020,12,S-Sorry, Iris...
EV07020,13,...
EV07020,14,What's wrong, Mon Frère?<br>Don't you remember?
EV07020,15,Cheer up, Iris.<br>Reni smiled because you were smiling.
EV07020,16,So come on, Iris. You gotta cheer up!
EV07020,17,You're right. Reni won't smile if I'm feeling sad.
EV07020,18,I'm gonna be so cheerful, that way Reni can always smile!
EV07020,19,That's it, Iris, that's the spirit!
EV07021,1,This wind is so strong... Even the Koubu might need to hold onto a tree to not get blown away.
EV07021,2,But I've got to save Reni...
EV07021,3,At any rate, I have to get to where she is. Nothing's going to get fixed until I talk to her.
EV07021,4,Just hold on, Reni!
EV08001,1,Suiko...<br>No, Saki...<br>Is there nothing we can do?
EV08001,2,Is there really no way you can go back to being our friend?
EV08001,3,Friend this, comrade that...<br>It's always those words with you!<br>You make me sick.
EV08001,4,I don't need any friends. As long as I have my master, that's enough for me.
EV08001,5,Justice is hypocrisy! Love is for the weak of heart!
EV08001,6,Suiko!
EV08001,7,The time I spent with all of you... I really did enjoy it.
EV08001,8,Seeing you frantically distraught, unaware that I was the one who shot Yoneda... Heheheheh...
EV08001,9,Damn you! Just how low will you stoop to?!
EV08001,10,In battle, the ends justify the means!
EV08001,11,No more... We won't let you have your way anymore, Suiko! We will defeat you!
EV08001,12,Heheheh... Finally getting serious, are we?
EV08001,13,Wh-What the... What the hell's going on?!
EV08001,14,Well then, here I come!
EV08002,1,Suiko...
EV08002,2,Heheh... Even though I said I don't believe in anybody...
EV08002,3,Somewhere, deep down... I believed in... him.
EV08002,4,But I have no regrets. I fought all on my own, right up to the very end...
EV08002,5,I can die with pride.
EV08002,6,Ungh... It looks like this is goodbye...
EV08002,7,Heheheh... Imperial Assault Troupe! Don't think the battles ahead will be this easy!
EV08002,8,...
EV08002,9,...
EV08002,10,Ogami...
EV08002,11,She fought for what she believed in... I don't think anyone could've stopped her.
EV08002,12,There's nothin' sadder than a soldier without a heart...
EV08002,13,But what's truly unforgivable are those who'd use people like her and throw 'em away! The Black Demon Society!
EV08002,14,...That's right.
EV08002,15,We have to defeat the Black Demons as soon as possible so we can put an end to this battle!
EV08002,16,Yeah! That there's why you're our chief!
EV08002,17,Captain...
EV08002,18,Reni...
EV08002,19,Captain, I'm going to keep fighting. For myself... and... for everyone!
EV08002,20,Reni...
EV08002,21,Yaaaay!<br>Reni smiled!<br>Reni smiled, you guys!
EV08002,22,C'mon, Reni, over here! You lead us in our usual thing this time!
EV08002,23,All right... Understood. Um, OK then...
EV08002,24,Victory pose, yeah!!
EV09001,1,Kasha!!<br>Where's Orihime?!
EV09001,2,Heheheh...<br>Take a look over there.
EV09001,3,I've courteously offered my hospitality to those two... With my special bomb, that is.
EV09001,4,What didja say?! What are you scheming?!
EV09001,5,Isn't it obvious?<br>I'm going to incinerate them.
EV09001,6,Once the bomb goes off, it'll be good riddance to old rubbish. I can picture them now, in that shack...
EV09001,7,They must be terrified, wondering how long they have until they're burnt alive. Heheheheh...
EV09001,8,What lucky pieces of trash they are, to be able to put on such a magnificent performance.
EV09001,9,You bastard...<br>That's enough outta you!!
EV09001,10,Kanna, Kasha can wait. Right now our priority's rescuing Orihime.
EV09001,11,Heheheh... Think you can make it in time?
EV09001,12,Let's go, everyone!<br>We're getting Orihime out of there!
EV10001,1,There are Hex Mechs here... I knew it, the Black Demon Society IS involved.
EV10001,2,Do you really think we'll be able to break through such a heavy defense, just the two of us?
EV10001,3,All we can do now is trust in the Tenbu and fight. Let's go, Sakura!
EV10001,4,Fwohohoho... Don't think this will go as you've planned.
EV10001,5,I knew this whole time that you two would come running back.
EV10001,6,Mokujiki... Damn, why now?!
EV10001,7,Simpletons such as yourselves are so easy to predict.
EV10001,8,Coming back here with some hastily cobbled together new Spirit Armor is the height of folly.
EV10001,9,You have no hope of winning. Now, if you would be so kind as to lay down and die before me.
EV10001,10,Don't think everything will always go as you've planned, Mokujiki! Prepare yourself!
EV10001,11,Yeah!
EV10002,1,Someone like you could never hope to understand.
EV10002,2,No matter how far apart we may be, our hearts are as one! We're always fighting together!
EV10002,3,Imperial Assault Troupe... You've ruined all my... careful planning...
EV10002,4,This defeat wasn't part of my calculatioooooooons!!
EV10002,5,There's one thing your calculations could never account for: the human heart.
EV10002,6,Let's hurry, Ogami. Everybody must be worried.
EV10002,7,Yeah, got it. Let's go, Sakura!
EV10025,1,Fwohohoho... How do you like my turrets? Terrifying, aren't they?
EV10025,2,Urgh... Is Kayama still not ready?
EV10025,3,Wh-What is this?! What's going on?!
EV10025,4,Hahahaha! "Good things come to those who wait", eh, Ogami?
EV10025,5,Kayama, you're a lifesaver! Now we can turn things around!
EV10025,6,Yes, but we can't rest easy just yet. There's still the Imperial Theater's defensive wall to worry about.
EV10025,7,Ogami, aim for the Koubu deployment door. It's the one part of the wall you'll be able to destroy.
EV10025,8,Got it! Thanks for the assist!
EV10025,9,Right. See you, Ogami! And stay frosty! Hahahaha!
EV10025,10,Ngh... Once again, I have made a careless oversight.
EV10025,11,But no amount of mistakes will rob me of my victory...
EV10026,1,Fwohoho... The Imperial Theater's defensive wall is proving to be very useful...
EV10026,2,Urgh... Is Kayama still not ready?
EV10026,3,Wh-What is this?! What's going on?!
EV10026,4,Hahahaha! "Good things come to those who wait", eh, Ogami?
EV10026,5,Kayama, you're a lifesaver! Now we can turn things around!
EV10026,6,Yes, but we can't rest easy just yet. Mokujiki still has his turrets.
EV10026,7,They have considerable firepower. Be careful, Ogami.
EV10026,8,Got it! Thanks for the assist!
EV10026,9,Right. See you, Ogami! And stay frosty! Hahahaha!
EV10026,10,Ngh... Once again, I have made a careless oversight.
EV10026,11,But no amount of mistakes will rob me of my victory...
EV11002,1,Demon King! Hand over the Regalia!
EV11002,2,If you want them...<br>Then come and take them.
EV11002,3,Wh-What power! If we're not careful, we could get blown away!!
EV11002,4,Urgh... Is that all you've got?!
EV11002,5,Oh-ho...
EV11002,6,Sakura!<br>Don't be reckless!!
EV11002,7,We won't let you... take the Regalia!
EV11002,8,Heheheh...
EV11002,9,Sakura!!
EV11002,10,I... I did it!
EV11002,11,Impressive...<br>You managed...<br>To land a blow on me...
EV11002,12,Sakura, don't let your guard down!!
EV11002,13,Even without the Pandemonium Regalia, so long as I take the life of Sakura Shinguji, it's the same in the end.
EV11002,14,...!
EV11002,15,I won't let you! I'll protect Sakura with everything I've got!
EV11002,16,If that resolve of yours is true, then come to our base in Akasaka.
EV11002,17,We'll settle everything there.
EV11002,18,...Akasaka, huh?
EV13001,1,For a backdoor, this place is pretty tightly guarded... Hm? What's that over there?
EV13001,2,That must be their defensive line! OK, let's blast through it and keep going!
EV13002,1,All right, looks like we made it through. Let's keep going!
EV15002,1,OK, let's hurry along. Not much longer till we reach the innermost part of this cave.
EV16001,1,I thought we'd run into more enemies, barging through the front door like that, but that was a piece of cake.
EV16001,2,...Wait, more are coming.
EV16001,3,They don't intend to let us simply walk in.
EV16001,4,Chief! Looks like it's gonna take a bit longer before we reach the bottom!
EV16001,5,There's no turning back! Destroy any and all enemies that appear!
EV16002,1,The reinforcements have stopped... Guess even then enemy's got their limits.
EV16051,1,Damn, reinforcements! I guess that's what we get for barging in through the front door!
EV16052,1,Ugh, even more backup! But we've got no choice but to keep going!
EV16053,1,M-More of them...? Just how many Hex Mechs do they have here, anyway?!
EV18030,1,How... How are there so many Kouma still alive?
EV18030,2,Ogami... Didn't all the Kouma die in our battle against Satan?
EV18030,3,Ensign... I thought we wiped out all the Kouma...
EV18030,4,Captain... I could've sworn the Kouma were annihilated along with Satan.
EV18030,5,But I thought we beat all the Kouma last time, right, Boss?
EV18030,6,But Mon Frère... I thought the Kouma were all gone now.
EV18030,7,No, look closer. They're definitely Kouma, but it looks like they've been mechanized.
EV18030,8,I swear, Japan's home to so many weird creatures.
EV18030,9,Kouma... Their attack power and stamina are on par with the Tenbu, if not higher...
EV18030,10,Heheh... This battle will be the perfect opportunity to test out the Kouma Weapons.
EV18030,11,Kouma Weapons?!
EV18030,12,That's right. After the battle two years ago, the military recovered wounded Kouma...
EV18030,13,And under the order of Lord Kyogoku, they were successfully modified into weapons in total secrecy.
EV18030,14,Well, Mokujiki's death did delay their completion, though.
EV18030,15,H-How could this be...?
EV18030,16,Now go, Kouma Weapons! Exterminate the Assault Troupe with your power!
EV20002,1,Th-The Kouma are retreating...
EV20002,2,You did it, Ogami! It seems like the demons can't do anything at this altitude.
EV20002,3,Then that means...
EV20002,4,The Mikasa is saved!
EV20002,5,Hooray! The Kouma won't be bothering us anymore!
EV20002,6,Phew... Looks like we managed to hold out.
EV20021,1,OK, understood!
EV20022,1,OK!
EV20023,1,O-OK!
EV21001,1,Yeah.<br>It's almost time.
EV21001,2,Ogami...
EV21001,3,No matter what happens...  Let's make it back home alive.
EV21001,4,Ensign...
EV21001,5,No matter what happens...  Let's return home alive.
EV21001,6,Captain...
EV21001,7,No matter what happens...  Let's make it back home alive.
EV21001,8,Boss...
EV21001,9,No matter what happens... We're gettin' outta here alive.
EV21001,10,Mon Frère...
EV21001,11,No matter what happens... Let's go home together.
EV21001,12,Chief...
EV21001,13,No matter what happens... Let's make it outta here alive.
EV21001,14,Ensign...
EV21001,15,No matter what happens...  Let's get back home alive.
EV21001,16,Captain...
EV21001,17,No matter what happens...  Let's return home alive.
EV21002,1,OK!<br>Let's move on ahead!
EV22002,1,...!
EV22002,2,Father!
EV22020,1,Captain...<br>This is the heart of Musashi.
EV22020,2,If we destroy that core, we can seal away the evil... Supposedly.
EV22020,3,But we're going up against that freak in the carnival mask. A head-on assault is too dangerous!
EV22020,4,Ogami. When the Demon King attacks, try to hide in the shadows of these pillars.
EV22020,5,If the Demon King uses the technique I think he will, that should be enough to protect you.
EV22020,6,Sakura...
EV22020,7,...Got it!<br>We'll use the pillars as a shield, get close to the Demon King, and destroy his Dark Kamui!
EV22021,1,Oh-ho...<br>It seems you've grown somewhat...
EV22021,2,I cannot afford to lose... For Lord Kyogoku...
EV22021,3,Oh Mighty Five Elements of the Black Demon Society... Lend me your power....
EV22022,1,Suiko!<br>Lend me your power!
EV22023,1,Mokujiki!<br>Lend me your power!
EV22024,1,Tsuchigumo!<br>Lend me your power!
EV22025,1,Kasha!<br>Lend me your power!
EV22026,1,Kongo!<br>Lend me your power!
EV22027,1,Now, then...<br>Allow me to show you all my true power...
EV22031,1,...
EV22031,2,Ngh... Urgh...
EV22031,3,Colonel Shinguji!
EV22031,4,You're not the Demon King! You're Sakura's father... Colonel Kazuma Shinguji!
EV22031,5,...
EV23001,1,Kyogoku!
EV23001,2,Musashi is absorbing the energy from the suppressed city...
EV23001,3,And now, I shall bring down the hammer on this false capital!
EV23001,4,I will not let you interfere!
EV23001,5,Come forth, Kouma!
EV23001,6,Wait, Kouma?!
EV23001,7,Wh-What are they doing here?! We performed the Rite of Four Swords!
EV23001,8,The power of the Rite of Four Swords amounts to nothing within Musashi! Ahahahaha!
EV23001,9,This place... shall be your grave!
EV23001,10,Captain!
EV23001,11,Yeah, I got it! Now's the time to combine our power!
EV23002,1,This is it... The final pillar.
EV23002,2,Now to to smash this thing, to protect the capital!
EV23002,3,Let's go, everyone! Put all your feelings into it!
EV23002,4,Yessir!
EV23002,5,Yessir!
EV23002,6,Yessir!
EV23002,7,Yessir!
EV23002,8,Yessir!
EV23002,9,Yessir!
EV23002,10,Yessir!
EV23002,11,Yessir!
EV23002,12,Father!
EV23002,13,We won't abide those who rob the people of their happiness!
EV23002,14,We all have people waiting for us back home!
EV23002,15,It's the happiness of people that builds cities!
EV23002,16,I won't let anyone get away with hurting everyone!
EV23002,17,We don't need tools that make folks unhappy!
EV23002,18,Those who scoff at love will be brought down by love!
EV23002,19,Witness the power of trusting comrades!
EV23002,20,Now... CRUMBLE!!
EV23002,21,Did we... do it?
EV23002,22,The flow of energy... has stopped.
EV23002,23,Now he's lost control over Musashi!
EV23002,24,YAHOO! Awright!
EV23002,25,S-Something... Still feels off...
EV23002,26,...
EV23002,27,I'm sensing a wicked energy...
EV23002,28,Stay on your guard, everyone!
EV23002,29,Ogami!
EV23002,30,...Let's move keep moving!
EV23002,31,I sense the evil energy too...
EV23002,32,Our fight's not over. Onward!
EV23002,33,Roger!
EV23002,34,Roger!
EV23002,35,Roger!
EV23002,36,Roger!
EV23002,37,Roger!
EV23002,38,Roger!
EV23002,39,Roger!
EV23002,40,Roger!
EV23002,41,...It seems the battle's not over yet.
EV23002,42,Let's keep moving, everyone...
EV23002,43,Roger!
EV23002,44,Roger!
EV23002,45,Roger!
EV23002,46,Roger!
EV23002,47,Roger!
EV23002,48,Roger!
EV23002,49,Roger!
EV23002,50,Roger!
EV23061,1,Hey, Sakura. Chief must be pretty antsy seeing us together like this.
EV23061,2,...Huh? Why?
EV23061,3,Haha, isn't it obvious why? Because of what happened in Fukagawa.
EV23061,4,Heehee, that's right! When we snuck into that restaurant dressed up as geisha.
EV23061,5,But we were fighting to set things right back then, just like we are right now.
EV23061,6,Now's our chance to show everyone what we've got! Let's do this, Sakura!
EV23061,7,You're right! Let's do our best, Kohran.
EV23065,1,Reni!
EV23065,2,...What is it, Iris?
EV23065,3,You seem like you're in a good mood!
EV23065,4,...Yeah.<br>I feel so fulfilled right now.
EV23065,5,Because I'm fighting alongside everyone... And you. For our own sakes.
EV23065,6,Teehee!<br>It's so nice that you're cheerful now, Reni!
EV23065,7,Y-Yeah. It's kind of odd, though, fighting with this feeling of fulfillment.
EV23065,8,It's not weird at all!<br>Fighting by your side is fun, Reni!
EV23065,9,...R-right. Anyway, we should get back to the battle, Iris.
EV23065,10,OK, let's do our best out there, Reni!
EV24001,1,Kyogoku! You're not getting away with this!
EV24001,2,Keep on prattling! What could you lowly worms possibly hope to understand without ideals?!
EV24001,3,Might makes right!<br>Victory makes right!<br>Bloodshed makes right!
EV24001,4,You've already lost, Kyogoku...
EV24001,5,There can be no "right" without love!
EV24002,1,Kyogoku... It's over.
EV24002,2,Looks like we won.
EV24002,3,Urgh...<br>Guh... Heheheh...<br>Wahahahaha!
EV24002,4,N-Now... You will face... Shinnou's... true power...
EV24002,5,Urrrrggggahhhh!!
EV24002,6,What... What on earth is happening?!
EV24002,7,Is... Is that...?!
EV24002,8,Gwahhhhhhh!!
EV24002,9,Shinnou's... taking over Kyogoku...
EV24021,1,Here we come, Kyogoku!<br>For the capital's future!<br>For everyone's future!
EV24021,2,For all their sakes...
EV24021,3,Sakura... Lend me your strength!
EV24021,4,Of course! We'll defeat Kyogoku by our own hands!
EV24021,5,We'll show Kyogoku the Flower Division's justice! [line 35 comes before this]
EV24021,6,Yeah... OK, let's go!
EV24021,7,Sumire... Lend me your strength!
EV24021,8,Ohoho, but of course.
EV24021,9,The time has come for us to show him our justice! Now, Ensign, let us go forth! [line 36 comes before this]
EV24021,10,Yeah, let's go, Sumire!
EV24021,11,Maria... Lend me your strength!
EV24021,12,Of course. You have my assistance, Captain.
EV24021,13,Now then, let's go, sir! Let's show him our justice! [line 37 comes before this]
EV24021,14,Yeah, let's go, Maria!
EV24021,15,Kanna... Lend me your strength!
EV24021,16,Yeah, of course! It's the moment of truth 'n all!
EV24021,17,Now let's show this creep what real justice looks like! [line 38 comes before this]
EV24021,18,Yeah, let's go, Kanna!
EV24021,19,Iris... Lend me your strength!
EV24021,20,OK! I'll always be with you, Mon Frère!
EV24021,21,Let's go, Mon Frère! Let's beat up this bad guy! [line 39 comes before this]
EV24021,22,Yeah, let's go, Iris!
EV24021,23,Kohran... Lend me your strength!
EV24021,24,You got it! Leave it to me!
EV24021,25,Let's go, Chief! Let's teach Kyogoku what justice is really about! [line 40 comes before this]
EV24021,26,Yeah, let's go, Kohran!
EV24021,27,Orihime... Lend me your strength!
EV24021,28,Of course! I can't stand this Kyogoku guy!
EV24021,29,Let's go, Ensign! We'll show him that justice is on our side! [line 41 comes before this]
EV24021,30,Yeah, let's go, Orihime!
EV24021,31,Reni... Lend me your strength!
EV24021,32,...Roger. If you wish, I will support you to the extent of my ability.
EV24021,33,The capital is where I met you and the others, it's special to me. That's why I'll protect it no matter what! [line 42 comes before this]
EV24021,34,Yeah, let's go, Reni!
EV24021,35,For the capital, for everyone... And for my father!
EV24021,36,I'll always be there by your side, Ensign!
EV24021,37,In the name of the Imperial Assault Troupe's Flower Division, we won't let Kyogoku have his way!
EV24021,38,Long as we're here, this Kyogoku guy's not gettin' his way!
EV24021,39,Besides, I'm not letting a bad guy like him get away with this!
EV24021,40,We're not gonna let anyone get away with trying to destroy the capital for their own ambitions!
EV24021,41,Besides, I just started liking this place! I won't let anyone destroy it!
EV24021,42,We cannot abide by the justice Kyogoku speaks of. Besides...
EV24021,43,We're taking you down, no matter what!
EV24040,1,Urgh... My attack didn't do anything?!
EV24040,2,You fool... A feeble attack like that has no effect on me!
EV24040,3,Damn, we can't do a thing with that arm of his in the way. All we can do is wait for our chance to strike...
EV24040,4,My sword... didn't even leave a scratch?!
EV24040,5,You fool... A feeble attack like that has no effect on me!
EV24040,6,I can't... do a thing. But I know there has to be weakness. I just have to find it.
EV24040,7,A Kanzaki Fujin style master like myself can't even leave a mark on this thing?!
EV24040,8,You fool... A feeble attack like that has no effect on me!
EV24040,9,Hmph, the next time you move that arm of yours, I'll be reading you your last rites!
EV24040,10,My attacks... aren't doing anything?!
EV24040,11,You fool... A feeble attack like that has no effect on me!
EV24040,12,It's that arm of his that's the problem. We have no choice but to wait for our chance to attack.
EV24040,13,My fists ain't even leavin' a mark?!
EV24040,14,You fool... A feeble attack like that has no effect on me!
EV24040,15,If that damn arm of yours wasn't in the way, I'd smash ya to pieces!
EV24040,16,Huh? My attacks... aren't working?!
EV24040,17,You fool... A feeble attack like that has no effect on me!
EV24040,18,What should we do? We have to get that arm out of the way, but it's too tough to break...
EV24040,19,What crazy defense! My attack didn't do squat!
EV24040,20,You fool... A feeble attack like that has no effect on me!
EV24040,21,Looks like that arm's gonna be a problem. We're not getting anywhere till that thing moves outta the way.
EV24040,22,My attacks didn't work?! Inconcepibile!
EV24040,23,You fool... A feeble attack like that has no effect on me!
EV24040,24,We're gonna have a hard time fighting him unless we get that arm out of the way!
EV24040,25,Direct hit... Enemy status... Unharmed?!
EV24040,26,You fool... A feeble attack like that has no effect on me!
EV24040,27,That arm's defense... Destroying it as it is now will be difficulty, but our chance will surely come.
EV25002,1,Destroying everything the people hold dear... It's wrong.
EV25002,2,We will protect everyone's futures... That is our justice!
EV25002,3,You understand nothing!
EV25002,4,Even if you defeat me here, it changes nothing!
EV25002,5,This city must be destroyed once and for all. It must be purged.
EV25002,6,There will come a day when someone will carry on my ideals.
EV25002,7,And for their sake... I will drag you all to hell with me!
EV25002,8,Kyogoku... This ends now!
EV25006,1,Not so fast!
EV26002,1,...Is it over?
EV26002,2,Yes! We won, Ogami!
EV26002,3,I fought super hard!
EV26002,4,That was our first battle in over a year, but you fought just as well as ever!
EV26002,5,Thanks, but this victory was achieved by all of us.
EV26002,6,Orihime, that is how the Imperial Assault Troupe fights.
EV26002,7,Combining our strength and believing in each other is the source of the Flower Division's strength.
EV26002,8,So once again, please, be our comrade. Be a part of the Imperial Assault Troupe.
EV26002,9,...
EV26002,10,Well, if you REALLY insist, I guess I'll think about it.
EV26002,11,Thank you, Orihime.
EV26002,12,All right then, it's been a while, let's do our usual thing!
EV26002,13,...Usual thing?
EV26002,14,Once the battle's over, we all strike a victory pose!
EV26002,15,Huh? Seriously? You couldn't make me do something so idiotic.
EV26002,16,Come on, it's fine! OK, here we go!
EV26002,17,Victory pose... Yeah!
EV27002,1,Ichiro Ogami, Captain of the Imperial Assault Troupe's Flower Division!
EV27002,2,Heh... Ichiro Ogami, huh?<br>I'll remember that.
EV27002,3,Next time I see ya, I'll make sure to carve that into your tombstone. Gahahaha!
EV27002,4,He got away...
EV27002,5,Ugh, what a dirty fight that was! I need to go home and take a shower!
EV27002,6,...Shall we pursue?
EV27002,7,No, let him be. We can't recklessly chase after the enemy.
EV27002,8,...
EV27002,9,He's right! I agree!
EV27002,10,Ah!
EV27002,11,Thank goodness.<br>The children are unhurt.
EV27002,12,...Yeah.
EV27002,13,Protecting the capital means protecting the happiness between a mother and her children.
EV27002,14,...
EV27002,15,Hm? Is something wrong, Iris?
EV27002,16,No, it's nothing...<br>I'm gonna go home now.
EV27002,17,What was that about? Iris got sad so suddenly.
EV27002,18,You're right...<br>I'm worried about her.
EV29001,1,It's you...!
EV29001,2,Fwohoho, indeed, it is I, Mokujiki, one of the Black Demon Society's Five Elements! We have plans of our own.
EV29001,3,I cannot let you interfere with them. You shall die for us.
EV29001,4,Target acquired. Switching to combat position.
EV29001,5,We're gonna beat you up, just like last time!
EV29001,6,Fwohoho... My calculations are perfect. I've got you all in the palm of my hand...
EV29001,7,...Here he comes!
EV29002,1,...
EV29002,2,Oh right, we never told Reni.
EV29002,3,These people like to do a victory pose after every battle.
EV29002,4,...Returning to base.
EV29002,5,Nope! You gotta do it with us, Reni! OK, here we go!
EV29002,6,Victory pose, yeah!!
EV30020,1,Can you hear me, Ogami? The enemy is targeting the Kanzaki estate.
EV30020,2,Don't let any enemies get near the building before we've finished evacuating everybody!
EV30020,3,Understood!
EV30026,1,Ogami, it looks like we'll need more time to finish the evacuation.
EV30026,2,Roger that, Kaede!
EV30027,1,The evacuation's almost finished, Ogami. Keep it up!
EV30027,2,Understood. Just gotta hold out for a little bit longer!
EV32002,1,OK, looks like Yamaguchi's managed to escape unharmed. All that's left is to eliminate the enemies!
EV32020,1,It looks like the enemies are all targeting you, Ogami.
EV32020,2,Keep them occupied until the car can get to a safe location!
EV32020,3,Understood!
EV33054,1,Sorry I'm late, Captain. Looks like I'm the last one here.
EV33054,2,Maria...
EV33054,3,You're as strong as ever.
EV33054,4,You're as pretty as ever.
EV33054,5,Welcome back.
EV33054,6,You're as strong as ever, Maria.
EV33054,7,Hm hm hm, and you haven't changed a bit, Captain.
EV33054,8,I'll be counting on you, Maria.
EV33054,9,Yes, let's do our best, sir.
EV33054,10,You're as pretty as ever, Maria...
EV33054,11,What are you saying, Captain?! Not in front of the enemy!
EV33054,12,R-Right. Sorry, Maria.
EV33054,13,Hm hm hm... It's a relief to see you haven't changed, sir.
EV33054,14,I'm looking forward to working with you again.
EV33054,15,...Welcome back.
EV33054,16,Captain...
EV33054,17,Sorry... It's been so long, I don't know what to say...
EV33054,18,No, Captain, those words are enough for me.
EV33054,19,Come, the enemy's right before us. Let's go, Captain!
EV33054,20,Yeah... Wait for me, Maria.
EV34001,1,Suiko! We've eliminated your squad!
EV34001,2,It's over... You have no hope of winning!
EV34001,3,Hehehe, is that right?
EV34001,4,Fine, I'll play with you, boy. Come at me from anywhere you like...
EV34001,5,Everyone, be careful!
EV34001,6,Roger!
EV34002,1,Our individual power may be insignificant...
EV34002,2,But we have each other! By working together, we'll never lose, no matter who we're up against!
EV34002,3,Hmph. Don't make me laugh, boy.
EV34002,4,Your friends aren't there to be trusted... They're there to be used.
EV34002,5,What did you just say!?
EV34002,6,Hm hm hm, trust and affection are nothing more than mere illusions. You'll realize that soon enough.
EV34002,7,I look forward to seeing the looks on your faces when that time comes. Hm hm hm... Until then.
EV34002,8,H-Hey, Suiko, wait a second!!
EV34002,9,...Dammit, Assault Troupe! We're pullin' back for today, but just you wait!
EV34002,10,...Enemy units have retreated. Shall we pursue, Captain?
EV34002,11,No... She already caught us by surprise, no need to be reckless.
EV34002,12,At any rate, I never thought we'd see the Society here.
EV34002,13,I wonder if Uncle Yoneda and everyone back at the theater are gonna be okay?
EV34002,14,Well, we'll be back tomorrow anyway, so don't worry 'bout it.
EV34002,15,Still, I wish the Black Demon Society would take a vacation too!
EV34002,16,Heehee, definitely. I'd like to enjoy my summer vacation.
EV34002,17,You'll all have to be straighten back up once vacation's over, okay?
EV34002,18,Yeah, yeah, we got it. More importantly, though, Maria, if you could do the usual.
EV34002,19,Hm hm, that's right. OK, here we go. 1, 2...
EV34002,20,Victory pose, yeah!
EV34003,1,Our individual power may be insignificant...
EV34003,2,But we have our friends! By working together, we'll never lose, no matter who we're up against!
EV34003,3,Hmph. Don't make me laugh, boy.
EV34003,4,Your friends aren't there to be trusted... They're there to be used.
EV34003,5,Wh-What?!
EV34003,6,Hm hm hm, trust and affection are nothing more than mere illusions. You'll realize that soon enough.
EV34003,7,I look forward to seeing the looks on your faces when that time comes. Hm hm hm... Until then.
EV34003,8,...Enemy unit has retreated. Shall we pursue, Captain?
EV34003,9,No... She already caught us by surprise, no need to be reckless.

EV34003,16,Yeah, yeah, we got it. More importantly, though, Maria, if you could do the usual.
EV34003,17,Hm hm, that's right. OK, here we go. 1, 2...
EV34003,18,Victory pose... Yeah!
EV34006,1,That voice...!
EV34006,2,Imperial Assault Troupe!<br>I'm ending this today!
EV34006,3,Sorry to keep ya waitin', Suiko.
EV34006,4,Kongo?!<br>I never gave you the signal!
EV34006,5,What? But you just sent me that transmission tellin' me to!
EV34006,6,...Transmission?
EV34006,7,I see now. Well done, Imperial Assault Troupe. You must've sent out a fake transmission.
EV34006,8,...? What're ya talkin' about, Suiko? What's goin' on?
EV34006,9,These little girls fooled you with a fake transmission, Kongo. Heheheh... You idiot.
EV34006,10,Wh-What?! Dammit, they tricked me! You fight dirty, Assault Troupe!
EV34006,11,Kongo, wait!
EV34006,12,You're on, Assault Troupe! I'm gonna chop every last one of ya to pieces!!
EV34007,1,Everyone, be careful!
EV34007,2,Roger!
EV34008,1,That voice...!
EV34008,2,Imperial Assault Troupe!<br>I'm ending this today!
EV34008,3,I'm backin' you up, Suiko! Ya got nothin' to fear now that I'm here!
EV34008,4,...Hmph. Overzealous as ever, I see.
EV34008,5,Heh, don't be like that. I'm a dependable guy!
EV34008,6,Here I come, Assault Troupe!
EV34040,1,We meet again, Ichiro Ogami! This ain't gonna go like last time!
EV34040,2,It'll end the same!
EV34040,3,This is bad...
EV34040,4,Kongo, no matter how many times we fight you, it'll always end the same! We'll never lose!
EV34040,5,Heh, big talk, as usual!<br>This is gonna be fun!!
EV34040,6,This is bad... Of all the people to show up as reinforcement, it had to be this pain in the ass...
EV34040,7,Heh, what's wrong? You sound pathetic, you're suckin' the fun out of this!
EV34040,8,...
EV34040,9,What's wrong? Too scared to say anything? Well here I come!
EV34041,1,Hey! You there, woman! I'm talkin' to you! The one wavin' your sword all around!
EV34041,2,I'm comin' at you with everything I've got! I'm choppin' you and that sword of yours to pieces!
EV34041,3,I'd like to see you try!!
EV34041,4,Heh, good answer! I'm not gonna hold anything back!!
EV34042,1,Hey, you! The yellow one, zippin' around everywhere!!
EV34042,2,...? The yellow one? You mean me?
EV34042,3,Y-You mean... She's just a kid?
EV34042,4,Hmph! I'm 12, you know! I'm not a kid!!
EV34042,5,D-Dammit, if anyone finds out I got beaten by a brat, I'll never hear the end of it.
EV34042,6,I'm not gonna go easy on you just cause you're a kid! ...Let's go!!
EV34043,1,Hey you, the one shootin' those weird lasers! That's a nice toy ya got there, but it won't work on me anymore!
EV34043,2,Hm hm! That's the kind of sour grapes I'd expect from a Japanese man.
EV34043,3,And just who was it again that got beaten by that "toy" last time?
EV34043,4,...Th-This girl really knows how to piss me off! I'll kill you!!
EV34044,1,Hey you, blue guy! I've been waitin' to settle things with you!
EV34044,2,...Settle what?
EV34044,3,Fightin' the strong's what I live for! So I'm gonna fight you, then beat you!
EV34044,4,He's bringing his emotions into battle and enjoying himself... What a strange enemy.
EV35001,1,Reni!
EV35001,2,Reniiii!
EV35001,3,Combat preparations complete. Enemies ahead... Use of force deemed necessary.
EV35001,4,Hm hm hm hm...<br>I'm going to savor watching you fight.
EV35001,5,The curtain rises on this fatal tragedy... I can't wait to see how it plays out.
EV35001,6,Mon Frère, please! Please... Save Reni!!
EV35001,7,You're the only one who can save her!
EV35001,8,...Got it. I'll handle this, Iris.
EV35001,9,Here I come, Reni!<br>I swear... I'll bring you back!
EV35001,10,I'll bring back your heart... And your smile! I'm bringing it all back!
EV35021,1,The wind's so strong... Even the Koubu might get blown away if we don't hold onto a tree or something.
EV35021,2,It could be dangerous. [continuation of text in 1?]
EV35021,3,Mon Frère, we've gotta save Reni!
EV35021,4,Yeah... At any rate, let's head over to where Reni is.
EV35021,5,We have to try talking to her first or we'll never get anywhere.
EV35021,6,Just hold on, Reni!
EV36001,1,OK, let's go, everyone!
EV36001,2,Yessir!
EV36001,3,The Imperial Assault Troupe has arrived!
EV36002,1,Wait, isn't that...<br>There's still one left?!
EV36002,2,Now, come! Light up the troupe and burn them to a crisp!
EV36002,3,I don't think so!!
EV36002,4,Wh-What are you doing?!<br>S-Stay back!<br>Get away from me!!
EV36002,5,S-STOOOOOP!<br>AHHHHHHHH!!!
EV36002,6,GAAAHHHHHH!!<br>The flames... The flames...<br>My body feels... so hot!!
EV36002,7,HOTHOTHOTHOTHOT!!<br>SOMEBODY, PUT IT OUT!!<br>I DON'T WANNA DIIIIIE!!
EV36002,8,...
EV36002,9,Ha... HAHAHAHA!<br>My... My body...<br>Is burning up!
EV36002,10,My body's...<br>Turning to ash...<br>Hyaha... HYAHAHAHAHAHA!!
EV36002,11,...
EV36002,12,Ensign...
EV36002,13,It seems I was...<br>Mistaken this whole time.
EV36002,14,Friends, teamwork...<br>I thought all of that was nonsense.
EV36002,15,But now...<br>I feel like I understand it a little...
EV36002,16,Everyone...<br>And you, Ensign...<br>Thanks.
EV36002,17,Orihime!
EV36002,18,Oh my, aren't we sweet all of a sudden?
EV36002,19,It seems the Flower Division has finally come together.
EV36002,20,... Orihime.<br>Let's both do our best from here on out.
EV36002,21,OK, Ensign.<br>You can count on me.
EV36002,22,But you'll have to take responsibility for changing my heart so quickly!
EV36002,23,Responsibility?<br>What responsibility?!
EV36002,24,Heeheehee!<br>OK, everyone!<br>Time for our usual thing!
EV36002,25,All right!<br>Make it a lively one, Orihime!
EV36002,26,All right, here we go!<br>1, 2...
EV36002,27,Victory pose, yeah!
EV36020,1,Here's a little something as thanks for ruining my performance.
EV36020,2,Wh-What's that?!
EV36020,3,Whatever it is, it can't be any good!
EV36020,4,Don't be like that. I got you a wonderful present, so please, just take it.
EV37001,1,Urgh... Is that... Kongo?!
EV37001,2,You finally showed up, Assault Troupe. Today we settle things, once and for all!
EV37001,3,As boorish as always, I see!
EV37001,4,I always thought of you as worthy opponents...
EV37001,5,But I was wrong! I'll chop you to pieces and get my revenge for her!
EV37002,1,Urrrgh... H-How!
EV37002,2,It's over, Kongo!
EV45002,1,W-Wait!
EV45002,2,Damn it, she got away...
EV45002,3,Oh well, let's just head back to the bridge for now. All units, regroup!
EV45033,1,Hahaha! I'll strike you and this ship down!
EV45033,2,Rgh, we won't let you!
EV45033,3,We will stop Musashi... and Kyogoku.
EV45033,4,Hah, shut up your trap! You're all gonna die here!
EV45033,5,I won't let you get even an inch closer to Lord Kyogoku!
EV45099,1,Wh-What?! Her mech changed color!
EV45099,2,Well, come at me, then! Strike me down with your so-called "power of justice"!
EV45099,3,The pain will only make me stronger!
EV45099,4,The pain will... make her stronger? Looks like we can't simply attack her, then.
EV45099,5,But she's got to have some kind of opening. We'll just have to be careful for now.
EV46002,1,This ends here, Tsuchigumo.
EV46002,2,I can't believe... I've been defeated by these... wretched humans...
EV46002,3,Why...<br>Why do you hate humans so much?
EV46002,4,Heheh...<br>I might not look like one, but I, too, am human.
EV46002,5,I've been despised my entire life... All because of this body.
EV46002,6,The one who gave a wretch like me this power... was Lord Kyogoku.
EV46002,7,I would gladly give my life to get my revenge on humankind!
EV46002,8,However, I don't intend to die at the hands of humans like you.
EV46002,9,I will die of my own free will! For Lord Kyogoku!
EV46002,10,I'll be watching from hell as Lord Kyogoku turns this capital into a city of death.
EV46002,11,Tsuchigumo...
EV46002,12,Dammit! Kyogoku, you bastard!
EV46002,13,It seems we have no choice but to strike Kyogoku down.
EV46002,14,...Yeah.
EV46002,15,At any rate, what the heck's going on with our Tenbu?
EV46002,16,My head hurts...
EV46002,17,Could it be...?
EV46002,18,...I think I might know why. But that explanation can wait till we're back on the bridge.
EV46002,19,Got it.<br>All units, back to base!
EV46003,1,C-Crap!
EV46003,2,EEEEEEK!
EV46003,3,The Mikasa... It's dropping output! We can't stay airborne any longer!
EV46003,4,Damn it! How can the Mikasa sink after we've come so far?!
EV46003,5,It's over for the humans in the capital. Hahahaha!
EV46003,6,Lord Kyogoku! I look forward to seeing the capital turn into a city of death!
EV46003,7,AHHHHHHH!
EV46021,1,Damn you... Vile humans... You hypocrites...
EV46021,2,I'll never let... a bunch of worms like you... stand in the way of Lord Kyogoku!
EV46021,3,I'll sink this ship with all of you on it!!
EV46021,4,Tsuchigumo... How persistent can you be?
EV47001,1,Yeah, you're right. It's finally time to enter the depths of Musashi.
EV47001,2,Gahahaha! Don't think I'll just let you assholes waltz right in!
EV47001,3,That voice...!
EV47001,4,It's me, Kongo, the leader of the Five Elements of the Black Demon Society!
EV47001,5,Oh great, the brute's back.
EV47001,6,Assault Troupe... I've been waiting for this day.
EV47001,7,Suiko...
EV47001,8,Mokujiki...<br>Kasha...<br>Tsuchigumo...
EV47001,9,Looks like I'm the last of the Five Elements.
EV47001,10,Assault Troupe...<br>I'm endin' this right here, right now, once and for all!
EV47001,11,All right, boys, come on out!
EV47001,12,HEH! ORAORAORA!<br>I'm not messin' around this time!
EV47001,13,Here I come, Assault Troupe!<br>It's all over for you!
EV47001,14,Let's go, everyone!
EV47021,1,...Guh! You're startin' to wear me down a bit.
EV47021,2,Heh, but we're only just gettin' started...!
EV47021,3,Here I come, Imperial Assault Troupe!!

SK0101,1,Looks nice outside considering that storm last night. The cherry blossoms seem to have made it through OK.
SK0101,2,Thanks to that, today's sake is extra delicious, right, Ogami?
SK0101,3,Yes, sir. I'm just glad to see you're doing well, General Yoneda.
SK0101,4,Darn straight I am! I see you're still as uptight as ever, though.
SK0101,5,Well, anyway, it's been a whole year since we last saw each other, so here's a toast to our reunion. Drink up!
SK0101,6,Yes, sir!
SK0101,7,...Oh ho, I see! A naval exercise off the coast of South America? Good work.
SK0101,8,It'd been so long since I'd trained at sea. It really put me through the wringer.
SK0101,9,Good, good. By the way, Ogami, how's the capital look after being away for so long?
SK0101,10,Well, it looks as lively as ever. Everything looks so peaceful.
SK0101,11,Peace, huh. It's an easy word to say, but a delicate thing. Fragile as a sugar sculpture...
SK0101,12,Listen, Ogami...
SK0101,13,I called you here today for one reason and one reason alone. We need you back in the troupe.
SK0101,14,But sir, I'm still assigned to the Imperial Navy!
SK0101,15,I've got your transfer papers right here, signed by the Minister of the Navy and General Staff Headquarters.
SK0101,16,Ensign Ichiro Ogami of the Imperial Japanese Navy, your orders for this new, special mission are to take command of the following unit:
SK0101,17,Imperial Assault Troupe, Anti-Kouma Assault Corps: Flower Division!
SK0101,18,I'm putting you back to work, Ogami.
SK0101,19,I'll give it my all! Until my very last breath!
SK0101,20,I'm looking forward to it.
SK0101,21,So I'm a ticket puncher again, huh...
SK0101,22,Understood, sir! I, Ichiro Ogami, will give it my all! Until my very last breath!
SK0101,23,All right, hold your horses, Ogami.
SK0101,24,If you start out this fired-up, you'll end up burning the candle at both ends, you know.
SK0101,25,I look forward to it. I can't wait to start things fresh as the captain of the troupe.
SK0101,26,Heheh, there you go getting all formal again.
SK0101,27,...So basically, I'm back to being a ticket puncher, aren't I?
SK0101,28,Ya got that right. The Flower Division's captain has to be a ticket puncher. It's tradition.
SK0101,29,I dunno whether to be happy or sad about this...
SK0101,30,Snap out of it, Ogami! What're you spacing out for?!
SK0101,31,Ah... A-Apologies, sir! I was just taken aback...
SK0101,32,Sheesh, you're just like you were a year ago. You haven't changed a bit.
SK0101,33,...By the way, Ogami, there's something I want to ask you before you resume your position as captain.
SK0101,34,Is there anyone in the Flower Division you have strong feelings for?
SK0101,35,Yes, there is.
SK0101,36,Not particularly.
SK0101,37,No, not particularly.
SK0101,38,Yes, there is.
SK0101,39,I see. All right then, who in the squad left the biggest impression on you?
SK0101,40,W-Well...
SK0101,41,It's Sakura.
SK0101,42,It's Sumire.
SK0101,43,It's Maria.
SK0101,44,What's wrong? Don't be shy, tell me.
SK0101,45,It's Kanna.
SK0101,46,It's Iris.
SK0101,47,It's Kohran.
SK0101,48,It's Sakura.
SK0101,49,I see. Sakura, eh?
SK0101,50,That's right, you did chase after her train that one time...
SK0101,51,Y-Yeah...
SK0101,52,I see. It's already been a whole year since then, huh.
SK0101,53,So how is Sakura doing, anyway?
SK0101,54,She was overjoyed when she heard you were coming back. Been a long time since you've seen each other, after all.
SK0101,55,Ogamiiii!
SK0101,56,W-Was that voice...? It couldn't be!
SK0101,57,S-Sakura!!
SK0101,58,When I told her you were coming back, she said she absolutely had to be here for it.
SK0101,59,All right now, get going. She's been waiting a long time for this, you know.
SK0101,60,Y-Yes, sir!
SK0101,61,Sakura...
SK0101,62,Ogami...
SK0101,63,Sakura... Long time no see.
SK0101,64,Ogami... Um... I...
SK0101,65,...
SK0101,66,Heehee, sorry. 
SK0101,67,I had so much I wanted to say when I finally got to see you.
SK0101,68,But now that I look at your face, the words are all gone.
SK0101,69,Sakura...
SK0101,70,I'm back.
SK0101,71,I missed you.
SK0101,72,I'm back, Sakura.
SK0101,73,...Welcome back, Ogami.
SK0101,74,Now we can be together again. I'm so happy.
SK0101,75,Sakura...
SK0101,76,Sakura, I've missed you.
SK0101,77,Ogami...
SK0101,78,The first time we met, the cherry blossoms were also in full bloom, right?
SK0101,79,Yes, that's right.
SK0101,80,That was... Two years ago, right?
SK0101,81,...
SK0101,82,S-Sorry. I, well... I just can't find the words.
SK0101,83,How about we just... Start with hello.
SK0101,84,R-Right. We haven't even properly greeted each other yet.
SK0101,85,Welcome back, Ogami. I look forward to working with you again.
SK0101,86,Likewise. Let's both do our best as members of the Flower Division.
SK0101,87,OK, looks like the touching reunion's over and done with.
SK0101,88,Yes, sir. Getting to see Ogami again is like a dream come true.
SK0101,89,Well, that's all well and good, for now.
SK0101,90,I don't mean to rain on your long-awaited reunion, but there's something I need to tell you two.
SK0101,91,The Flower Division is a combat unit that fights demons to protect the peace of the capital.
SK0101,92,You'll have to put your lives on the line when you're fighting out there.
SK0101,93,I understand how happy you two feel right now, but you'll need to keep your feelings in check.
SK0101,94,Y-Yes, sir...
SK0101,95,Keeping the peace isn't an easy job. You need to be ready for anything at any given moment.
SK0101,96,So that we never have to repeat... the tragedy of losing those we hold dear.
SK0101,97,General Yoneda...
SK0101,98,You two can be friendly with each other like before, I don't mind. I just wanted to make things clear.
SK0101,99,Yes, sir. Understood.
SK0101,100,Oops, it's about that time. Sakura, take Ogami to the theater, if you'd please.
SK0101,101,Understood. Well then, Ogami, let's head over to the Grand Imperial Theater.
SK0101,102,Yes. It's Sumire.
SK0101,103,I see. Sumire, eh?
SK0101,104,That's right. You went to that party of hers, dressed to the nines.
SK0101,105,Y-Yeah...
SK0101,106,I see. It's already been a whole year since then, huh.
SK0101,107,So... How is Sumire doing, anyway?
SK0101,108,She seemed quite happy to hear you were coming back.
SK0101,109,She even told me she'd come here specially to meet you.
SK0101,110,Huh? Th-Then that means-
SK0101,111,Yup, and it's just about that time, too.
SK0101,112,S-Sumire!
SK0101,113,What a touching reunion. Well, it's been a while. You two take your time.
SK0101,114,Y-Yes, sir!
SK0101,115,Sumire...
SK0101,116,It's been ages, Ensign.
SK0101,117,I'm back, Sumire. You seem to be doing well.
SK0101,118,Oh, enough with the frivolities, Ensign.
SK0101,119,Don't you have a more appropriate greeting for me?
SK0101,120,(More appropriate?)
SK0101,121,You've grown more beautiful.
SK0101,122,I've been dying to see you.
SK0101,123,Your attendance is appreciated.
SK0101,124,Sumire, you've grown even more beautiful.
SK0101,125,Oh my, not bad. Stating the obvious won't get you far, though.
SK0101,126,No, I, uh... I was trying to tell you my honest feelings.
SK0101,127,Ohohoho. Straightforward as ever. I see, Ensign.
SK0101,128,You, too, have grown more handsome since last we met.
SK0101,129,Th-Thanks.
SK0101,130,Sumire, I've been dying to see you again.
SK0101,131,G-Goodness, Ensign...
SK0101,132,You've gotten quite... bold since last we met.
SK0101,133,W-Well, not that I mind, but...
SK0101,134,Perhaps you should rein it in somewhat.
SK0101,135,R-Right. Sorry.
SK0101,136,Thank you for coming, your attendance is greatly appreciated.
SK0101,137,What are you on about, Ensign? What do you think this is, a wedding?
SK0101,138,No, I just... When you asked if there was a more appropriate greeting, I thought maybe...
SK0101,139,Ohohohoho! I see your sense of humor is as lively as ever, Ensign.
SK0101,140,I yield, Ensign. You truly are different from other men.
SK0101,141,...
SK0101,142,...Ensign? Is something the matter? You're so quiet.
SK0101,143,S-Sorry. I was just trying to think of something to say.
SK0101,144,But, I truly am happy to see you again, Sumire. I mean it.
SK0101,145,Indeed. Words don't suffice for something like this.
SK0101,146,I know how you feel, Ensign. Thank you.
SK0101,147,OK, looks like the touching reunion's over and done with.
SK0101,148,Excuse me, sir, but we were having a moment! Could you refrain from spoiling it?
SK0101,149,Wahahaha! Sorry, sorry, didn't mean to tease you.
SK0101,150,I don't mean to rain on your long-awaited reunion, but there's something I need to tell you two.
SK0101,151,The Flower Division is a combat unit that fights demons to protect the peace of the capital...
SK0101,152,You'll have to put your lives on the line when you're fighting out there.
SK0101,153,I understand how happy you two feel right now, but you'll need to keep your feelings in check.
SK0101,154,F-Feelings, you say? S-Since when have I had such feelings for the Ensign?
SK0101,155,Come on, Sumire, listen to me. This is serious. 
SK0101,156,...
SK0101,157,Keeping the peace isn't an easy job. You need to be ready for anything at any given moment.
SK0101,158,That way we never have to repeat the tragedy of losing those we hold dear...
SK0101,159,General Yoneda...
SK0101,160,You two can be friendly with each other like before, I don't mind. I just wanted to make things clear.
SK0101,161,Besides, Sumire, you two won't be seeing each other for a little while.
SK0101,162,I know it's hard, but it's times like this that you need to keep your emotions under control.
SK0101,163,...
SK0101,164,Won't be seeing each other"? What do you mean, General?
SK0101,165,You'll have to ask Sumire yourself later.
SK0101,166,Now then, Sumire, if you could escort Ogami to the Grand Imperial Theater.
SK0101,167,...Of course. Understood, sir.
SK0101,168,Yes. Maria.
SK0101,169,I see. Maria, eh?
SK0101,170,That's right. You two went to Russia together.
SK0101,171,Y-Yes. We took a special holiday.
SK0101,172,I see. It's already been a whole year since then, huh.
SK0101,173,So, how is Maria doing, anyway?
SK0101,174,Maria's accompanying Count Hanakoji on a business trip to America. She's headed to New York.
SK0101,175,I see... So I won't get to see her, then.
SK0101,176,That is, she was supposed to be headed there, but she told me she just had to see you.
SK0101,177,She delayed her departure just so she could be here.
SK0101,178,Huh?! Th-Then that means...
SK0101,179,Yep. Looks like it's about that time.
SK0101,180,M-Maria!!
SK0101,181,What a touching reunion. Well, it's been a while. You two take your time.
SK0101,182,Yes, sir!
SK0101,183,Maria...
SK0101,184,Captain... It's been a long time.
SK0101,185,Maria, have you been well?
SK0101,186,Yes. I'm relieved to see you're doing well, too.
SK0101,187,I look forward to having you as our captain again.
SK0101,188,Likewise.
SK0101,189,Looking forward to a fresh start.
SK0101,190,Likewise. I'm happy to be back in the Flower Division again.
SK0101,191,So am I. It's an honor to be working with you again, Captain.
SK0101,192,Let's work together to keep the capital safe.
SK0101,193,Yeah, I'm looking forward to a fresh start.
SK0101,194,At any rate, it's my first time back in over a year. I'll need to keep my wits about me.
SK0101,195,Haha, it's all right. I know you'll be able to bring the Flower Division together.
SK0101,196,Let's both do what we can to keep the capital safe.
SK0101,197,Hmm? What's wrong, Captain?
SK0101,198,Oh, sorry. It's just... There's so much I want to say.
SK0101,199,Indeed.
SK0101,200,Whenever I try to put my thoughts into words, it all falls apart.
SK0101,201,But I'm glad I could see your face one more time before I have to leave.
SK0101,202,Maria...
SK0101,203,OK, looks like the touching reunion's over and done with.
SK0101,204,But boy, leave it to Maria to make it so serious.
SK0101,205,Y-Yes, well...
SK0101,206,Hey, that's just who you are. No need to be embarrassed.
SK0101,207,I don't mean to rain on your long-awaited reunion, but there's something I need to tell you two.
SK0101,208,The Flower Division is a combat unit that fights demons to protect the peace of the capital.
SK0101,209,You'll have to put your lives on the line when you're fighting out there.
SK0101,210,I understand how happy you two feel right now, but you'll need to keep your feelings in check.
SK0101,211,...Yes, sir.
SK0101,212,Keeping the peace isn't an easy job. You need to be ready for anything at any given moment.
SK0101,213,That way we never have to repeat the tragedy of losing those we hold dear...
SK0101,214,General Yoneda...
SK0101,215,...
SK0101,216,Maria already knows, so I'll leave it at that.
SK0101,217,I know you won't be seeing each other again for a while, but don't let that get in the way of your work.
SK0101,218,Understood. It's just as you say, sir.
SK0101,219,Glad to hear it. Now then, Maria, if you could escort Ogami to the Grand Imperial Theater.
SK0101,220,Yes, sir. Once I escort the captain, I'll be headed straight for New York. I'll be back come July.
SK0101,221,Got it, see you then. Have a safe trip.
SK0101,222,Yes, sir. You take care of yourself as well, sir.
SK0101,223,Yes. Kanna.
SK0101,224,I see. Kanna, eh?
SK0101,225,That's right. You two went to Okinawa together.
SK0101,226,Y-Yeah...
SK0101,227,I see. It's already been a whole year since then, huh.
SK0101,228,So, how is Kanna doing, anyway?
SK0101,229,Kanna's back in Okinawa for karate training.
SK0101,230,I see. So I won't get to see her, then.
SK0101,231,That is, she was supposed to be headed there, but she told me she just had to see you.
SK0101,232,She delayed her departure just so she could be here.
SK0101,233,Huh?! Th-Then that means...
SK0101,234,Yep. Looks like it's about that time.
SK0101,235,Heeeeey, Boss!
SK0101,236,K-Kanna!!
SK0101,237,What a touching reunion. Well, it's been a while. You two take your time.
SK0101,238,Yes, sir!
SK0101,239,Kanna...
SK0101,240,Yo, Boss! Long time no see!
SK0101,241,Kanna, you seem as upbeat as ever.
SK0101,242,Heheh! My energy's my strong suit.
SK0101,243,Y'know, Boss, I've gotten way better at karate over the past year.
SK0101,244,How 'bout it? Let's have a sparring match!
SK0101,245,All right, let's go a round!
SK0101,246,H-Hold on a sec!
SK0101,247,All right, let's go a round! I've gotten stronger myself, too!
SK0101,248,Heheh, that's my Boss! Straight to the point. OK, here I come!!
SK0101,249,Whoa, hey, what are you two trying to pull in a place like this?
SK0101,250,Oh, whoops. Totally forgot about the manager there.
SK0101,251,Heheh, still, I'm glad I could see you before I head off.
SK0101,252,H-Hold on a sec! Are we seriously gonna spar in a place like this?
SK0101,253,Ahahaha! Relax, I'll go easy on you.
SK0101,254,R-Really? Still, if worse comes to worst...
SK0101,255,I mean, I don't think the others would forgive me if I wrecked you. Hahaha!
SK0101,256,Well, here's to a healthy working relationship, Boss!
SK0101,257,...
SK0101,258,Ah, my bad. Challenging you to a fight right when we meet is kinda weird, huh?
SK0101,259,...Sorry, Boss. I'm not good at this kinda stuff.
SK0101,260,I'm glad I get to see you, but I have no idea what to say.
SK0101,261,I understand. It's OK. That's just how you are.
SK0101,262,Heh, you think so? Thanks, Boss.
SK0101,263,OK, looks like the touching reunion's over and done with.
SK0101,264,That little exchange was pretty typical for you two.
SK0101,265,Heheh, I guess. "Reunion" sounds kinda dramatic.
SK0101,266,It's all right, I'm not very good at the sentimental stuff either.
SK0101,267,I don't mean to rain on your long-awaited reunion, but there's something I need to tell you two.
SK0101,268,The Flower Division is a combat unit that fights demons to protect the peace of the capital.
SK0101,269,You'll have to put your lives on the line when you're fighting out there.
SK0101,270,I understand how happy you two feel right now, but you'll need to keep your feelings in check.
SK0101,271,Whoa whoa whoa! Since when do Boss and I have feelings for each other?
SK0101,272,Keeping the peace isn't an easy job. You need to be ready for anything at any given moment.
SK0101,273,That way we never have to repeat the tragedy of losing those we hold dear...
SK0101,274,General Yoneda...
SK0101,275,...
SK0101,276,You two can be friendly with each other like before, I don't mind. I just wanted to make things clear.
SK0101,277,I know you won't be seeing each other again for a while, but don't let that get in the way of your work.
SK0101,278,... Yeah, I got it. It's important to set boundaries.
SK0101,279,So we're clear, then. Now, Kanna, if you could escort Ogami to the Grand Imperial Theater.
SK0101,280,Got it, leave it to me. Oh yeah, sir?
SK0101,281,Once I drop him off, I'm headed straight to Okinawa.
SK0101,282,I see. Take care, Kanna.
SK0101,283,You too, sir. All right, let's go, Boss.
SK0101,284,Yes, Iris.
SK0101,285,...Iris?
SK0101,286,Now that you mention it, you two went to France together.
SK0101,287,Y-Yeah. We took a special holiday...
SK0101,288,I see. It's been a year since you last saw her.
SK0101,289,So how is Iris doing?
SK0101,290,She was overjoyed when she heard you were coming back. Been a long time since you two have seen each other, after all.
SK0101,291,Mon Frèèère!
SK0101,292,W-Was that voice...? It couldn't be!
SK0101,293,Ah, Mon Frère! Over here, over here!
SK0101,294,I-Iris?! What's she doing here?!
SK0101,295,When I told her you were coming back, she said she absolutely had to be here for it.
SK0101,296,All right now, get going. She's been waiting a long time for this, you know.
SK0101,297,Y-Yes, sir!
SK0101,298,Iris...
SK0101,299,Mon Frère...
SK0101,300,Heehee, Mon Frère! It really is you!
SK0101,301,Have you been doing well?
SK0101,302,Yeah, of course. Looks like you've been doing well, too.
SK0101,303,Uh huh! Jean-Paul also came to see you!
SK0101,304,Is that so? Thanks.
SK0101,305,...
SK0101,306,Mon Frère...
SK0101,307,Hm?
SK0101,308,Don't leave again. OK?
SK0101,309,I don't want to be left behind anymore...
SK0101,310,Iris...
SK0101,311,Mon Frère, you promise you won't leave me alone anymore. Right?
SK0101,312,I promise.
SK0101,313,I can't promise that.
SK0101,314,I promise. I won't abandon you ever again.
SK0101,315,Really?
SK0101,316,Yes, really.
SK0101,317,Really really?
SK0101,318,Really really.
SK0101,319,Thanks, Mon Frère. It's a promise!
SK0101,320,Yes, it's a promise.
SK0101,321,Sorry, but I can't promise that.
SK0101,322,Huh?! Why not?!
SK0101,323,I'd have to leave the moment I get orders to return to the Navy.
SK0101,324,I don't want to lie to you, Iris, so that's why I can't make that promise.
SK0101,325,Mon Frère...
SK0101,326,...
SK0101,327,You understand, right, Iris?
SK0101,328,I love that you're honest, Mon Frère. I'm sorry for being so selfish.
SK0101,329,Iris...
SK0101,330,But it's OK, now we're together again! 
SK0101,331,Haha, that's right. Now that I'm back at the theater, we can be together.
SK0101,332,Uh huh!
SK0101,333,...
SK0101,334,Sorry. I just got transferred, so I can't say one way or the other yet.
SK0101,335,But we'll be together for now, at least. Is that OK?
SK0101,336,Yeah... OK. That's fine.
SK0101,337,You're back, and that's all that matters.
SK0101,338,Thanks, Iris.
SK0101,339,OK, looks like the touching reunion's over and done with.
SK0101,340,Uh huh! Thank you, Uncle Yoneda!
SK0101,341,Now, now, no need to thank me.
SK0101,342,I don't mean to rain on your long-awaited reunion, but there's something I need to tell you two.
SK0101,343,The Flower Division is a combat unit that fights demons to protect the peace of the capital.
SK0101,344,You'll have to put your lives on the line when you're fighting out there.
SK0101,345,I understand how happy you two feel right now, but you'll need to keep your feelings in check.
SK0101,346,I don't understand a single thing you're saying!
SK0101,347,Hrm... Basically, don't act too lovey-dovey.
SK0101,348,No!
SK0101,349,Noooo way! I'm Mon Frère's girlfriend!
SK0101,350,I won't stop loving him!
SK0101,351,BLEHHH!!
SK0101,352,H-Hey! Iris!
SK0101,353,Bahahaha! There's no helping you, is there, Iris?
SK0101,354,Well, I guess I can make an exception. Ogami doting on you isn't anything new, after all.
SK0101,355,Yaaay! Isn't that great, Mon Frère? He said we can be lovers!
SK0101,356,...Y-Yeah.
SK0101,357,Oops, looks like it's that time. Iris, if you could escort Ogami to the theater for me.
SK0101,358,You know the way there, right?
SK0101,359,Don't worry! I'm old enough to know that!
SK0101,360,OK then, Mon Frère, follow me! C'mon, hurry!
SK0101,361,Yeah, yeah...
SK0101,362,Yes. Kohran.
SK0101,363,I see. Kohran, eh?
SK0101,364,That's right. You two went to China together.
SK0101,365,R-right.
SK0101,366,I see. It's been a year since you last saw her.
SK0101,367,So how is Kohran doing, anyway?
SK0101,368,Kohran's currently stationed at the Hanayashiki Branch.
SK0101,369,You remember the Hanayashiki Branch, don't you? They design and manufacture the troupe's weapons over there.
SK0101,370,She's not ready to become head of Hanayashiki just yet, but she seems really popular over there.
SK0101,371,And she's been keeping up their morale over the past year since they've been left without any leadership.
SK0101,372,I see. So I won't get to see her when I get back to the theater...
SK0101,373,That is, she was supposed to be headed there, but she told me she just had to see you.
SK0101,374,She's heading over here to greet you.
SK0101,375,Huh?! Th-Then that means...?!
SK0101,376,Yep. Looks like it's about that time.
SK0101,377,Ogamiiii!
SK0101,378,K-Kohran!!
SK0101,379,What a touching reunion. Well, it's been a while. You two take your time.
SK0101,380,Yes, sir!
SK0101,381,Kohran...
SK0101,382,Ahaha! It really IS you, Chief! This isn't a dream after all!
SK0101,383,Kohran, you look good.
SK0101,384,You're looking plenty manlier yourself, Chief!
SK0101,385,You... You think so?
SK0101,386,So you just got back from the Navy, huh?
SK0101,387,To be totally honest, I was hoping I could give you a big welcome with a new invention of mine.
SK0101,388,This was all so sudden, I didn't have time to get anything ready. Sorry about that.
SK0101,389,Kohran...
SK0101,390,Getting to see you is enough.
SK0101,391,You'll have to show me sometime.
SK0101,392,Don't worry about it. Just being able to see you is more than enough.
SK0101,393,Th-That's real bold of you to say.
SK0101,394,Chief. Are you really OK with just this?
SK0101,395,I'm gonna be at Hanayashiki, so we won't be able to see each other for a while, y'know?
SK0101,396,We've been apart for a year already. What's a little longer?
SK0101,397,Besides, you're coming back to the Flower Division eventually, right?
SK0101,398,O-Of course I am! Once my work's all wrapped up, I'll be right there!
SK0101,399,I see. Well, that's too bad. You'll have to show me sometime.
SK0101,400,Yeah! Sure! I'll have it all ready for next time!
SK0101,401,Look forward to it, OK?
SK0101,402,...
SK0101,403,Wh-What's wrong, Chief? You're spacing out...
SK0101,404,N-Nothing. I was just trying to imagine what kind of invention you had ready for me.
SK0101,405,Like, what it would've done to me...
SK0101,406,Heyyy, what's that supposed to mean?
SK0101,407,OK, looks like the touching reunion's over and done with.
SK0101,408,Thanks a bunch for calling me over at Hanayashiki, Yoneda.
SK0101,409,Now, now, no need to thank me.
SK0101,410,I don't mean to rain on your long-awaited reunion, but there's something I need to tell you two.
SK0101,411,The Flower Division is a combat unit that fights demons to protect the peace of the capital...
SK0101,412,You'll have to put your lives on the line when you're fighting out there.
SK0101,413,I understand how happy you two feel right now, but you'll need to keep your feelings in check.
SK0101,414,Wh-What are you talking about? What's that supposed to mean?
SK0101,415,Keeping the peace isn't an easy job. You need to be ready for anything at any given moment.
SK0101,416,That way we never have to repeat the tragedy of losing those we hold dear...
SK0101,417,General Yoneda...
SK0101,418,You two can be friendly with each other like before, I don't mind. I just wanted to make things clear.
SK0101,419,I know you won't be seeing each other again for a while, but don't let that get in the way of your work.
SK0101,420,...
SK0101,421,Don't worry, Yoneda, I got it.
SK0101,422,Glad to hear it. Now, Kohran, if you could escort Ogami to the Grand Imperial Theater.
SK0101,423,Alrighty, roger that! C'mon, Chief, let's go.
SK0101,424,Oh yeah, Yoneda, I'll be heading straight back to Hanayashiki after this, so please excuse me.
SK0101,425,Got it. Tell the guys at Hanayashiki I said hi.
SK0101,426,Thanks a bunch, Yoneda! I'll be back as soon as I can! See ya!
SK0101,427,What?! "Not particularly"? Did you forget about everyone in the Flower Division?
SK0101,428,Oh well, I suppose it has been a year.
SK0101,429,We can't have you forgetting your way back to the theater, though, so I brought over a guide for you.
SK0101,430,Ogamiiii!
SK0101,431,S-Sakura!!
SK0101,432,When I told her you were coming back, she said she absolutely had to be here for it.
SK0101,433,All right now, get going. She's been waiting a long time for this, you know.
SK0101,434,Y-Yes, sir!
SK0101,435,Ogami! I've waited so long for you to come back!
SK0101,436,Sakura Shinguji, Imperial Assault Troupe Flower Division, reporting for duty once again!
SK0101,437,I look forward to working with you!
SK0101,438,Likewise. I'm eager to start things fresh.
SK0101,439,I'll leave escorting him to the theater to you, Sakura.
SK0101,440,Yes, sir. Understood.
SK0101,441,By the way, Ogami, do you remember where the Grand Imperial Theater is?
SK0101,442,It's in Asakusa.
SK0101,443,It's in Ginza.
SK0101,444,It's in Sendai.
SK0101,445,It's in Asakusa, right?
SK0101,446,Nope. The Grand Imperial Theater is in Ginza, remember?
SK0101,447,Our munitions factory, the Hanayashiki Branch, is over in Asakusa.
SK0101,448,O-Oh. Is that so...
SK0101,449,It's in Ginza, right?
SK0101,450,Yes, that's right. At the intersection on Fourth Street, right in the heart of Ginza.
SK0101,451,It's in Sendai, right?
SK0101,452,Oh, come on, Ogami! That's completely wrong!
SK0101,453,The Grand Imperial Theater is in Ginza.
SK0101,454,I'm from Sendai.
SK0101,455,Is that so?
SK0101,456,Heehee. You've always been such a kidder, Ogami.
SK0101,457,Um. Uhhh...
SK0101,458,Ogami, did you seriously forget?
SK0101,459,The Grand Imperial Theater is in Ginza.
SK0101,460,Try to remember from now on. You're the captain of the Flower Division, after all.
SK0101,461,Oops, it's about that time. Sakura, if you'd be so kind as to escort Ogami to the Grand Imperial Theater?
SK0101,462,Understood. Well then, Ogami, let's head over to the Grand Imperial Theater.
SK0101,463,You'd never be able to guess that the Grand Imperial Theater, right in the heart of Ginza...
SK0101,464,...is actually the headquarters of the Imperial Assault Troupe.
SK0101,465,All right, Ogami, we're here.
SK0101,466,All right, Ogami, we're here.
SK0101,467,All right, Ensign, we've arrived.
SK0101,468,All right, Captain, we're here.
SK0101,469,OK, Boss, we're here.
SK0101,470,Heheh, we're here, Mon Frère!
SK0101,471,All right, Chief, we're here.
SK0101,472,(The Grand Imperial Theater, the Imperial Assault Troupe's Ginza Headquarters.)
SK0101,473,(I'm back. At long last, I'm back at the Imperial Theater.)
SK0101,474,Um, Ogami?
SK0101,475,What is it, Sakura?
SK0101,476,You know how the manager just told us to "keep our feelings in check", right?
SK0101,477,It's like he said. While we work as stage performers as part of the troupe...
SK0101,478,We also have to put our lives on the line as members of the troop to defend the capital from harm.
SK0101,479,We can't afford to get distracted like that.
SK0101,480,Sakura...
SK0101,481,So I'm going to restrain myself, just like the manager told us to.
SK0101,482,Just... know that none of that changes how I feel about you, Ogami.
SK0101,483,Sakura...
SK0101,484,Thank you.
SK0101,485,I... can't.
SK0101,486,Thank you.
SK0101,487,I... can't.
SK0101,488,I feel the same way.
SK0101,489,Thank you. That means a lot to me.
SK0101,490,Let's both do our best, as fellow members of the Flower Division.
SK0101,491,OK!
SK0101,492,I... can't.
SK0101,493,Huh?
SK0101,494,We just got back together. I don't want to have to bottle up my feelings for you again...
SK0101,495,O-Ogami, don't be so unreasonable...
SK0101,496,You'll worry me, and all the others, too.
SK0101,497,Sakura...
SK0101,498,We need to be able to rely on you as captain of the Flower Division.
SK0101,499,I'm sorry. You're right. I shouldn't be talking like that as your captain.
SK0101,500,Let's both do our best, as fellow members of the Flower Division.
SK0101,501,OK!
SK0101,502,I feel the same way.
SK0101,503,...
SK0101,504,Thank you, it means a lot to me to hear you say that.
SK0101,505,I'm sorry. I can't think of what to say.
SK0101,506,But I know how you feel, Sakura. Thank you.
SK0101,507,No, that's all right. It was so sudden of me... I'm sorry.
SK0101,508,All right then, Ogami, let's head inside.
SK0101,509,Oh, that's right! I have something I need to take care of, you go on ahead.
SK0101,510,What is it?
SK0101,511,Heehee, it's a secret. We'll have a nice long chat later, OK?
SK0101,512,What was that all about? Now I'm curious.
SK0101,513,Oh well, might as well head inside. Starting today, I'll be working at the Grand Imperial Theater once again.
SK0101,514,Ensign...
SK0101,515,What is it, Sumire?
SK0101,516,Ensign, doesn't this bother you?
SK0101,517,What does?
SK0101,518,Ugh! You're as oblivious as ever, Ensign!
SK0101,519,You know, what the manager told us earlier!
SK0101,520,Oh. About romantic feelings, right?
SK0101,521,On stage or in battle, sure, but he wants to control how we act in private, too?
SK0101,522,N-Now, now...
SK0101,523,Now nothing! What do you think of all this, Ensign?
SK0101,524,I agree with him.
SK0101,525,Nothing we can do about it.
SK0101,526,I agree with him.
SK0101,527,Nothing we can do about it.
SK0101,528,I don't agree with him either.
SK0101,529,It was awfully sudden, but I agree with him.
SK0101,530,...
SK0101,531,I'm the captain of the Flower Division. I can't be giving special treatment to any of my subordinates.
SK0101,532,But I'm not going to deny my feelings for you, either.
SK0101,533,So... What if we just got along the way we used to?
SK0101,534,Well, if that's what you think, Ensign, then so be it.
SK0101,535,All right then, let's head inside.
SK0101,536,There's not much we can do about it. He's got a point.
SK0101,537,Do you really think so? Are you just giving up, then?
SK0101,538,W-Well I'd be lying if I said I was happy about that.
SK0101,539,To be honest, I don't agree with him either.
SK0101,540,I knew it, you feel the same as I do.
SK0101,541,Does he not trust me?
SK0101,542,...
SK0101,543,Ensign, you're gravely mistaken.
SK0101,544,He deeply values your capabilities as captain of the Flower Division.
SK0101,545,Sumire...
SK0101,546,Sorry. To be honest, I don't really know, myself.
SK0101,547,It's all so sudden, I'm still trying to process it.
SK0101,548,I think I know just how you feel, Ensign.
SK0101,549,...Huh?
SK0101,550,The love we fostered shall never be extinguished...
SK0101,551,...and anyone who gets in the way of our romance can get trampled to death by horses for all I care!
SK0101,552,Ohhhhohoho!
SK0101,553,Ha... Haha... W-Well, in any case, let's just carry on like we used to.
SK0101,554,Understood, Ensign.
SK0101,555,All right then, Sumire, how about we head inside now?
SK0101,556,...
SK0101,557,Actually, Ensign, I'm afraid this is where we must part.
SK0101,558,Part? But why?! We just got back together!
SK0101,559,The truth is, I just received news that my grandfather has fallen ill.
SK0101,560,What? Is he all right?
SK0101,561,I don't know. All anyone will tell me is I have to go back to my family's estate.
SK0101,562,I see.
SK0101,563,Ensign, I must go now.
SK0101,564,But be sure to take care of each and every member of the Flower Division.
SK0101,565,I'm sure they'll all be worried sick without the theater's top star at their side.
SK0101,566,Yeah, that's true. Leave everything here to me.
SK0101,567,Give your grandfather my regards. I'm looking forward to your return.
SK0101,568,Thank you. Well then, Ensign, take care.
SK0101,569,Sumire...
SK0101,570,...Captain.
SK0101,571,What is it, Maria?
SK0101,572,I'm sure General Yoneda told you already...
SK0101,573,...but I have to go to accompany Count Hanakoji on his trip to America.
SK0101,574,Right. I finally get to see you after so long only for us to separate again.
SK0101,575,It's only three months. We'll see each other again soon.
SK0101,576,As of today, you're the captain of the Flower Division once again.
SK0101,577,So please, think about the others rather than worry about me.
SK0101,578,Leave it to me.
SK0101,579,I feel nervous.
SK0101,580,Leave it to me.
SK0101,581,I feel nervous.
SK0101,582,...Please, don't go.
SK0101,583,Leave it to me. I'll keep a close eye on them while you're out.
SK0101,584,Good! Thank you.
SK0101,585,Maria, come back as soon as you can, OK?
SK0101,586,OK. I'll be back the moment my assignment is over.
SK0101,587,To be honest, I feel kind of nervous not having you here.
SK0101,588,Captain, you can't be saying things like that.
SK0101,589,Y-You're right. I'm sorry.
SK0101,590,Still, I'd feel a lot better with you by my side.
SK0101,591,Maria, please come back soon.
SK0101,592,Of course. I'll be back the moment my assignment is over.
SK0101,593,Maria, please don't go.
SK0101,594,...
SK0101,595,I'm finally back, I finally get to see you, and now we have to separate again...
SK0101,596,Pull yourself together! You're the captain of the Flower Division, aren't you?!
SK0101,597,Huh?!
SK0101,598,As captain, everyone in the Flower Division trusts you with their lives.
SK0101,599,What good would it do them for you to wallow in your self-pity like this?
SK0101,600,...
SK0101,601,I'm happy you feel that way, I really am...
SK0101,602,...but please, think harder about what the manager told us.
SK0101,603,Maria...
SK0101,604,...
SK0101,605,Don't look so down, Captain. I'll be back by July.
SK0101,606,You're right. Just take care of yourself, OK?
SK0101,607,I will. Thank you.
SK0101,608,It seems the tram is here. Well then, I have to get going.
SK0101,609,I'll see you later, Captain. Look after the others for me.
SK0101,610,Take care.
SK0101,611,I will. Well then, goodbye.
SK0101,612,Maria...
SK0101,613,Hey, Boss?
SK0101,614,What's up, Kanna?
SK0101,615,It's about time for me to head out.
SK0101,616,Ah, right, you're heading over to Okinawa.
SK0101,617,Heh, karate's all I got, y'know.
SK0101,618,I've been doing nothing but acting this past year, I'm starting to get rusty.
SK0101,619,I'll train a ton in Okinawa. I'm gonna get way stronger, and then I'll come right back.
SK0101,620,I see...
SK0101,621,Good luck!
SK0101,622,Why do you have to go train?
SK0101,623,Let's spar when you get back.
SK0101,624,Why do you have to go train?
SK0101,625,All right, I understand. I'm sure you have a good reason.
SK0101,626,Good luck over there, Kanna. I'll be waiting.
SK0101,627,Heh, thanks, Boss.
SK0101,628,I gotta say, you've become a hell of a guy.
SK0101,629,I don't even have to say a thing and you totally get me.
SK0101,630,Ah, it's no big deal.
SK0101,631,Kanna. Why do you have to go train?
SK0101,632,Hmmm, figures you wouldn't understand.
SK0101,633,Long story short, I can't settle for how strong I currently am.
SK0101,634,Kanna...
SK0101,635,All right then, let's spar once you get back!
SK0101,636,Oh? You sure, boss? You might get hurt!
SK0101,637,Haha, don't forget, I'm a soldier!
SK0101,638,Don't think I'll go down easy, even with all your training!
SK0101,639,Haha! Lookin' forward to it! Be sure to work out a ton while I'm gone!
SK0101,640,...
SK0101,641,C'mon, Boss, I can't leave on a high note if you're looking at me like that.
SK0101,642,S-Sorry, I just couldn't think of what to say.
SK0101,643,I don't have any cool quips or anything, but... I'll be waiting for you, Kanna.
SK0101,644,Yeah, there we go! That's the spirit! This ain't goodbye forever!
SK0101,645,Ah, there's my ride. I gotta go. See ya, Boss.
SK0101,646,Take care. Look after the others for me!
SK0101,647,Yeah, take care of yourself too, Kanna!
SK0101,648,I know, I know! I'll get even stronger and come right on back!
SK0101,649,Later, Boss!
SK0101,650,Kanna...
SK0101,651,Hey, Mon Frère?
SK0101,652,What is it, Iris?
SK0101,653,Heheh, we're together again. I get to be with you again!
SK0101,654,Hahaha, that's right, Iris.
SK0101,655,Hey, Mon Frère. Don't you think I've changed?
SK0101,656,...You have?
SK0101,657,You're prettier now.
SK0101,658,...You have?
SK0101,659,You're prettier now.
SK0101,660,You're more grown up now.
SK0101,661,...You have?
SK0101,662,C'mon, Mon Frere! It's been so long since we last saw each other!
SK0101,663,You're supposed to say that I'm prettier, or more grown up, or something!
SK0101,664,I-I see. I'm sorry.
SK0101,665,You're just the same as always. You just don't understand a lady's heart at all!
SK0101,666,R-right.
SK0101,667,You're right. You're even prettier now than you used to be.
SK0101,668,Hee hee hee, really? Yaaay! I'm so happy!
SK0101,669,Um, but Mon Frère, did you notice anything else?
SK0101,670,Huh? Did something else happen?
SK0101,671,Yep! I'm 11 years old now.
SK0101,672,Don't you think I'm more grown-up now?
SK0101,673,Y-Yeah.
SK0101,674,You're right. You're more grown up now.
SK0101,675,Really? So you did notice! I knew you would, Mon Frère!
SK0101,676,I'm 11 years old now. I'm a real adult now, huh?
SK0101,677,Hahaha, that you are.
SK0101,678,Heehee. Thank you, Mon Frère.
SK0101,679,Mon Frère, why won't you say something?!
SK0101,680,Uh... S-Sorry. You asked me so suddenly.
SK0101,681,Sheesh, you're so dense!
SK0101,682,Sorry, Iris.
SK0101,683,C'mon, Mon Frère, let's go inside!
SK0101,684,Right. I wonder how the others are doing?
SK0101,685,Um, so right now, it's just me and Sakura here.
SK0101,686,Huh?! Where are the others?
SK0101,687,Sumire went home to her family because her grandpa fell ill.
SK0101,688,Kanna went to Okinawa to train...
SK0101,689,Maria has work to do in New York...
SK0101,690,...and Kohran is also working at the Hanayashiki Branch.
SK0101,691,I see. So I won't get to see everyone, huh?
SK0101,692,It's OK! Everyone's gonna be back by summer!
SK0101,693,Besides, now that you're here, I won't be so lonely anymore.
SK0101,694,Is that so? That's great, Iris.
SK0101,695,Oh, that's right! I have to go get ready now.
SK0101,696,Later, Mon Frère, I'll be going now! Bye-bye!!
SK0101,697,Hey, Iris! And she's gone.
SK0101,698,But I wonder what she's getting ready for? Now I'm curious.
SK0101,699,Chief?
SK0101,700,What's up, Kohran?
SK0101,701,It's about time I headed back to the Hanayashiki Branch.
SK0101,702,That's right, you were transferred over there...
SK0101,703,Yup! I'm smack dab in the middle of a secret project!
SK0101,704,I'll be back in the summer, so just hang tight, Chief.
SK0101,705,I'm looking forward to it.
SK0101,706,I can't wait.
SK0101,707,I'm looking forward to it.
SK0101,708,I can't wait.
SK0101,709,What's this "secret project"?
SK0101,710,I'm looking forward to your return to the theater once you're done with your work.
SK0101,711,Thanks a bunch, Chief. You saying that makes my work feel worth it.
SK0101,712,I see. Honestly though, I can't wait.
SK0101,713,I finally get to see you again, but now you have to go...
SK0101,714,Ch-Chief, I'm flattered, but...
SK0101,715,We both have important jobs to do to keep a whole lot of people safe.
SK0101,716,I'll be working super hard to make sure that happens.
SK0101,717,So let's both get our heads in the game, Chief!
SK0101,718,All right, got it. Let's both do our best, even while we're apart!
SK0101,719,Roger that! I'll be back at the theater in the summer, so hang tight!
SK0101,720,Hang on. What's this about a "secret project"?
SK0101,721,Heheh! I can't say a word, not even to you, Chief!
SK0101,722,Well, a secret project at Hanayashiki can only mean one thing, right?
SK0101,723,You'll just have to wait until summer. Look forward to it!
SK0101,724,What, you don't care about my job, is that it, Chief?
SK0101,725,N-No... That's not it at all.
SK0101,726,...
SK0101,727,Ahahahaha! Relax, Chief, I'm just kidding.
SK0101,728,I'll be right back once I'm done with all my work, so rest easy.
SK0101,729,Heh, of course, I'd rather get back to the Flower Division as soon as possible, though.
SK0101,730,Like I told Yoneda, I'll be back as soon as I'm all done.
SK0101,731,...Ah! Shoot, it's already time. I gotta head back.
SK0101,732,Shall I escort you to the bus stop, Kohran?
SK0101,733,Nah, don't worry about me. I came here on my steam bike, just in case.
SK0101,734,All right, Chief, I'm heading back to Hanayashiki now.
SK0101,735,Good luck, Kohran. I'm looking forward to your "secret project."
SK0101,736,Thanks a bunch... Oh, right, I almost forgot.
SK0101,737,I left a present for you in your room, try not to forget about it!
SK0101,738,A... present?
SK0101,739,Yep, one of my inventions. It's real handy, too, so take good care of it!
SK0101,740,All right, Chief, see you in the summer!
SK0101,741,Yeah. Take care, Kohran.
SK0101,742,OK, later!
SK0101,743,Kohran...
SK0101,744,We're here, Ogami. The Imperial Assault Troupe's headquarters: the Grand Imperial Theater.
SK0101,745,We normally work as stage performers, as part of the "Imperial Assault Troupe."
SK0101,746,But when enemies appear, we deploy as a combat unit also known as the "Imperial Assault Troop."
SK0101,747,We'll be counting on you from now on.
SK0101,748,Leave it to me.
SK0101,749,I'll do what I can for now.
SK0101,750,Leave it to me.
SK0101,751,I'll do what I can for now.
SK0101,752,I don't know if I can do this...
SK0101,753,Leave it to me. Everyone in the Flower Division can count on me.
SK0101,754,Thank you so much! You truly are dependable, Ogami.
SK0101,755,I'm still not used to being back yet, so I'll just do what I can for now.
SK0101,756,Of course. Take all the time you need.
SK0101,757,I don't know if I can do this, I feel kinda nervous.
SK0101,758,You'll be fine, Ogami! Have some faith!
SK0101,759,...
SK0101,760,Ogami? What's wrong?
SK0101,761,N-Nothing, I was just trying to think of an answer.
SK0101,762,Heehee, you have nothing to worry about, Ogami. You'll be fine.
SK0101,763,All right, then, let's head inside.
SK0101,764,Ah, but first, there's something I need to take care of, so you go on ahead.
SK0101,765,What is it?
SK0101,766,Heehee, it's a secret. We'll have a nice long chat later, OK?
SK0101,767,What was that all about? Now I'm curious.
SK0101,768,All right, then, time to head inside. This is my workplace from now on.
SK0101,769,I'm sorry, Ogami, but each customer is only allowed to purchase one photo at a time.
SK0101,770,I see. That's too bad.
SK0101,771,So sorry, Ogami, but each customer is only allowed to purchase one photo at a time.

SK0102,1,Wow, it's been a long time since I was last at the theater. I wonder how everyone is?
SK0102,2,Oh, Ogami!
SK0102,3,Ahh! Is it... Is it really you, Ogami?
SK0102,4,Sakura...
SK0102,5,I-I'm sorry. What a strange thing to say.
SK0102,6,I had so many dreams about you returning that...I thought maybe this was another dream.
SK0102,7,Sakura...
SK0102,8,I'm back.
SK0102,9,This isn't a dream.
SK0102,10,I dreamt of this, too.
SK0102,11,I'm back, Sakura. I'm so happy to see you again.
SK0102,12,Welcome back, Ogami...
SK0102,13,I look forward to working with you again. Let's both do our very best!
SK0102,14,Same to you. Let's give it our all.
SK0102,15,I'm happy that you were dreaming of me...but this isn't a dream.
SK0102,16,Yes, you... You're right. You and I can be together again.
SK0102,17,I'll be counting on you this time too, Ogami.
SK0102,18,Yes. And I'll be counting on you, as well.
SK0102,19,I dreamt of this, too. Of coming back to the troupe, and seeing you again.
SK0102,20,Ogami... Thank you.
SK0102,21,I'm so happy to know you felt the same way.
SK0102,22,Sakura...
SK0102,23,Ogami, please say something. You're not embarrassed, are you?
SK0102,24,S-Sorry... Somehow, the words just wouldn't come to me.
SK0102,25,But I'm so glad to see you again, Sakura. That's how I really feel.
SK0102,26,Somehow, it's finally starting to sink in.
SK0102,27,The Grand Imperial Theater, this is the place I've been assigned to.
SK0102,28,And starting today, I'll be serving here as captain of the Imperial Assault Troupe.
SK0102,29,Please lead us well from here on this time, too.
SK0102,30,Yes. I'll do my utmost to ensure that the citizens of the capital can lead peaceful lives.
SK0102,31,By the way, Ogami, I'm sorry I couldn't come to meet you.
SK0102,32,Ever since this morning, I've been hard at work on your... Oops!
SK0102,33,My... what?
SK0102,34,Um... Noth... I-It's nothing.
SK0102,35,Well, I have something to take care of, so I'll be off.
SK0102,36,That was rather sudden. Wonder what it was.
SK0102,37,Oh! Mon Frère!!
SK0102,38,That voice...
SK0102,39,Yaay, yaay! Mon Frère, Mon Frère! You came baaack!
SK0102,40,I've been waiting for you to come back for sooo long!
SK0102,41,Iris, is that you?
SK0102,42,I'm relieved to see you're doing well. And in such high spirits, too.
SK0102,43,Heehee! That's 'cause I'm super-duper happy!
SK0102,44,Lookie, Jean-Paul the bear is happy, too!
SK0102,45,Hahaha. Thanks, you two.
SK0102,46,Hey, Mon Frère...
SK0102,47,Hm? What is it?
SK0102,48,Mon Frère, do you notice anything different about me?
SK0102,49,Is something different?
SK0102,50,You're prettier now.
SK0102,51,Is something different?
SK0102,52,You're prettier now.
SK0102,53,You're grown up now.
SK0102,54,Is something different?
SK0102,55,Sheesh, Mon Frère! It's been so long since we saw each other!
SK0102,56,So you're supposed to say that I'm prettier, or more grown up, or something!
SK0102,57,I-I see. I'm sorry.
SK0102,58,You're just the same as always. You don't understand a lady's heart at all!
SK0102,59,Urm, yeah.
SK0102,60,You're right... You're even prettier now than you used to be.
SK0102,61,Hee hee hee, really? Yaay! I'm so happy!
SK0102,62,Um, but Mon Frère, did you notice anything else?
SK0102,63,Huh? Did something else happen?
SK0102,64,Yep! I'm 11 years old now.
SK0102,65,Don't you think I'm more grown-up now?
SK0102,66,Y-Yeah.
SK0102,67,You're right. You're more grown up now.
SK0102,68,Really? So you did notice! I knew you would, Mon Frère!
SK0102,69,I'm 11 years old now. I make a fine adult, don't I?
SK0102,70,Hahaha, that you do.
SK0102,71,Hee hee... Thank you, Mon Frère.
SK0102,72,Mon Frère, why won't you say anything?!
SK0102,73,Uh... S-Sorry. You asked me so suddenly.
SK0102,74,Sheesh, you're so dense!
SK0102,75,Sorry, Iris.
SK0102,76,By the way, how is everyone else in the Flower Division?
SK0102,77,Um, so right now, it's just me and Sakura here.
SK0102,78,Huh?! Where'd everyone else go?
SK0102,79,Sumire went home because her grandpa collapsed. She's there now.
SK0102,80,Kanna went to Okinawa for training...
SK0102,81,Maria has work to do in New York...
SK0102,82,...and Kohran is working, too. She went to the Hanayashiki branch.
SK0102,83,Oh, so I won't get to see everyone.
SK0102,84,But it's OK, 'cause everyone will be back by this summer!
SK0102,85,Besides, now that you're here, I won't be so lonely anymore.
SK0102,86,Is that so. You're amazing, Iris.
SK0102,87,Oh, that's right! I have to go get ready now.
SK0102,88,Later, Mon Frère, I'll be going now! Bye-bye!!
SK0102,89,Hey, Iris!... There she goes.
SK0102,90,But I wonder what she has to go get ready for. How curious.
SK0102,91,Hey there, Ogami.
SK0102,92,Oh, General Yoneda, so you're just arriving, too?
SK0102,93,Hey now, as long as we're inside the theater, I'm just the manager, so it's "Mr. Yoneda" to you.
SK0102,94,Ah, my apologies. I wasn't thinking.
SK0102,95,Eh, I suppose you only did just return. Just be more careful from now on.
SK0102,96,That aside, as of today at 1200, you'll be appointed captain of the Flower Division.
SK0102,97,Fill out the arrival paperwork at the secretarial office first, then report to the manager's office at 12 o'clock sharp.
SK0102,98,Right, understood.
SK0102,99,R-Right... Understood.
SK0102,100,Right, understood.
SK0102,101,Hmm. That's a nice, prompt reply.
SK0102,102,R-Right... Understood.
SK0102,103,...It took you a little while to respond, there.
SK0102,104,...
SK0102,105,Hey, Ogami, you gonna say something or not?
SK0102,106,Uh... I-I'm sorry.
SK0102,107,For pete's sake, just as carefree as ever, aren't you?
SK0102,108,Depending on whether you reply right away or take your time with it, the person you're talking to will respond differently.
SK0102,109,As captain of the Flower Division, you'd best take care how you speak to people.
SK0102,110,Now then, there's still some time until 12 o'clock. Why don't you go wander around the theater until then?
SK0102,111,I have until 12 o'clock to go to the manager's office, huh?
SK0102,112,I've still got some time, so I guess I'll take a walk around the theater.
SK0102,113,Shoot, when did it turn 12 o'clock already?!
SK0102,114,I need to get to the manager's office right away! I can't believe I'm going to be late like this on my first day back.
SK0102,115,Ogami.
SK0102,116,That voice...
SK0102,117,It's been quite some time, Ogami. Do you remember me? I'm Kasumi Fujii, from the secretarial office.
SK0102,118,Ah, Kasumi. I'm going to be working here at the theater again.
SK0102,119,Yes, I heard as much from Mr. Yoneda. We're grateful to have you back.
SK0102,120,By the way, Ogami, have you filled out your arrival forms yet?
SK0102,121,No, not yet.
SK0102,122,I thought that may be the case. Well, please come to the secretarial office so we can get the formalities out of the way.
SK0102,123,Eeek!
SK0102,124,Whoa?!
SK0102,125,O-Ogami! I'm so sorry!
SK0102,126,I'm perfectly fine, but are you all right, Sakura?
SK0102,127,Yes, I'm fine. Thanks for your concern.
SK0102,128,I don't have much time, so I need to get moving... I'm really sorry.
SK0102,129,Is there something I can help you with?
SK0102,130,What are you doing?
SK0102,131,Is there something I can help you with? You seem pretty busy.
SK0102,132,N-No, it's fine, but I appreciate you asking.
SK0102,133,Uh... You only just returned to the theater, so please take it easy.
SK0102,134,I guess I will, but if there's ever anything I can help you with, just let me know.
SK0102,135,OK. Thanks so much.
SK0102,136,You're sure in a hurry. What are you doing?
SK0102,137,Um, I'm going to the kitchen...
SK0102,138,The kitchen? What for?
SK0102,139,Huh? Er, well... N-Nothing at all!
SK0102,140,O-Ogami? Are you sure you're OK?
SK0102,141,Sorry, sorry, I should've said something. I'm fine, really.
SK0102,142,I'm such a klutz. I'm sorry.
SK0102,143,You don't need to worry over me. If you're busy, you should get moving.
SK0102,144,Is that so? All right.
SK0102,145,Well, I'm in a bit of a hurry, so please excuse me.
SK0102,146,Hahaha, look at her go.
SK0102,147,Still, I wonder what she's in such a rush for?
SK0102,148,Ogami.
SK0102,149,That voice...
SK0102,150,It's been quite some time, Ogami. Do you remember me? I'm Kasumi Fujii, from the secretarial office.
SK0102,151,Ah, Kasumi. I'm going to be working here at the theater again.
SK0102,152,Yes, I heard as much from Mr. Yoneda. We're grateful to have you back.
SK0102,153,By the way, Ogami, have you filled out your arrival forms yet?
SK0102,154,No, not yet.
SK0102,155,I thought that may be the case. Well, please come to the secretarial office so we can get the formalities out of the way.
SK0102,156,My apologies, Ogami, but this area is off-limits.
SK0102,157,Off-limits? What for?
SK0102,158,There are some repairs going on in the basement, so no one can go down there.
SK0102,159,Additionally, this area back here is off-limits to you in particular, Ogami.
SK0102,160,Off-limits only to me? What are you talking about?
SK0102,161,I'm very sorry, but I can't say any more at the present.
SK0102,162,In any case, please take care you don't tread into any off-limits areas. I hope you understand.
SK0102,163,I apologize, Ogami, but the back rooms and the basement are currently off-limits.
SK0102,164,Oh right, I remember you telling me that. Oh well, I suppose I'll head somewhere else.
SK0102,165,Ah, Ogami!
SK0102,166,You remember me, don't you? It's Yuri Sakakibara, from the secretarial office.
SK0102,167,Nice to see you again after so long, Ogami. It's me, Kasumi Fujii from the secretarial office.
SK0102,168,Ogami, welcome!
SK0102,169,Ah, sorry about that! I just yelled out like I always do.
SK0102,170,Tsubaki Takamura here, from the gift shop. I hope you'll come by to purchase some photos again!
SK0102,171,It's been a while, everyone! Let's all work hard together again.
SK0102,172,All right, Ogami, here's that arrival paperwork to fill out, if you please.
SK0102,173,You got it. Let's see... How's this?
SK0102,174,Yes, that should do. Thank you very much.
SK0102,175,Ogami, if you hear any juicy gossip, be sure to bring it my way!
SK0102,176,And we have lots of new photos in stock, so be sure to swing by and buy one!
SK0102,177,I'm sure we'll have plenty of odd jobs for you to help with again. I'll be counting on you.
SK0102,178,Same here. Let's all do our best.
SK0102,179,We look forward to working with you!
SK0102,180,OK, where to next?
SK0102,181,Ogami.
SK0102,182,Hey, Tsubaki, you seem to be in a good mood.
SK0102,183,Yes! I'm really excited to have you back with us!
SK0102,184,Ogami, what makes you happiest about returning to the theater?
SK0102,185,Working for the sake of peace.
SK0102,186,Getting to see you again, maybe?
SK0102,187,Being able to fight for peace, of course.
SK0102,188,A straight-laced answer is just what I expected from you, Ogami!
SK0102,189,Getting to see you again, maybe?
SK0102,190,Oh, quit messing around! You're quite the flirt, aren't you, Ogami?
SK0102,191,Being straight-laced and being flirty are both a part of who you are.
SK0102,192,Whether you're being all cool and serious, or flirting and joking around, it suits you either way.
SK0102,193,Depending on what sort of attitude you usually take, the words you use to get your meaning across will change, too.
SK0102,194,I see.
SK0102,195,But it's not something you should worry about all that much.
SK0102,196,You are who you are, Ogami. And I think you're just fine that way!
SK0102,197,Well, I should be going. Come by the gift shop later if you'd like!
SK0102,198,Being straight-laced, or being flirty... I wonder which is most like me?
SK0102,199,OK, I'd better get to the manager's office.
SK0102,200,Ack! It's past 12 o'clock already!
SK0102,201,If I don't get over to the manager's office right away, he'll be furious!
SK0102,202,Oh, Ogami. Is there something you need?
SK0102,203,Tell me some gossip.
SK0102,204,I'll come back later.
SK0102,205,By the way, during the year you weren't here...
SK0102,206,...public transit in the capital has seen a lot of growth.
SK0102,207,Really? How so?
SK0102,208,Like steam taxis, for instance. There's been a huge boom in steam-powered automobiles.
SK0102,209,For just a single yen, you can go anywhere in the city! It's both fast and convenient.
SK0102,210,Right now, taxis are outpacing rail transport in popularity at a huge rate!
SK0102,211,Wow, that's something else.
SK0102,212,Ogami, have you heard of "Mikasa Memorial Park"?
SK0102,213,Remember how the Aerial Battleship Mikasa crashed in our previous battle?
SK0102,214,The bow of that ship is still sitting in Tokyo Bay...
SK0102,215,...so it was opened to the citizens of the capital to be used as a park.
SK0102,216,Huh, is that so?
SK0102,217,Once we learned you were coming back, it was crazy around here for a few days.
SK0102,218,Iris was running around the theater in high spirits...
SK0102,219,...and Sakura got all fired up and cleaned your room for you.
SK0102,220,We did some repairs to the theater while you were gone, too.
SK0102,221,We even added some new rooms, like a game room and a music room.
SK0102,222,Also, we outfitted other places like the dining hall with some new decorations.
SK0102,223,Wow. I'll have to go check them out later.
SK0102,224,The basement is still under repair though, so it's off-limits. Take care not to go down there.
SK0102,225,Over at the gift shop, we have some new photos of the Flower Division available for purchase.
SK0102,226,You can only buy one per month, but I heard that if you get one every month, something good will happen!
SK0102,227,Something good?
SK0102,228,Heheh, that's something to look forward to once you've collected all of them!
SK0102,229,Hey Ogami, I heard you sailed around the entire world during your stint in the Navy, right?
SK0102,230,What sorts of places did you visit? Tell me some interesting stories!
SK0102,231,I can't talk about that with anyone outside the Navy. Sorry.
SK0102,232,Aww, that's no fun. But I suppose it makes sense when I think about it.
SK0102,233,Well, if any more gossip-worthy news comes along, be sure to tell me!
SK0102,234,The Flower Division will be putting on four different plays this year.
SK0102,235,With more time to prepare, we can hold more extravagant, quality productions... Well, that's the reasoning, anyway.
SK0102,236,Our production for the summer season is "King Lear." It's slated to open in June.
SK0102,237,I saw a huge rat in the attic earlier. Goodness, did it spook me.
SK0102,238,Hm? The attic? You can reach it by taking the stairs up from the second floor.
SK0102,239,Sorry, Ogami, but I'm all out of gossip for now.
SK0102,240,I'll have some more interesting tidbits for you another time, so look forward to it!
SK0102,241,Thanks, Yuri. If anything happens, I'll come ask you about it.
SK0102,242,And if any interesting gossip comes your way, be sure to let me know!
SK0102,243,Ogami.
SK0102,244,Hey, Sakura. Enjoying the sunlight?
SK0102,245,Yes. The weather's so nice today, I decided to take a little walk.
SK0102,246,(Her hair is gleaming in the spring sunlight, it's really lovely.)
SK0102,247,Is there something stuck in my hair?
SK0102,248,N-No, not really.
SK0102,249,I just caught sight of your hair and was admiring it. Sorry, I shouldn't have stared like that.
SK0102,250,Thank you, Ogami. Hearing you say that... makes me so happy.
SK0102,251,(I can see myself reflected in her eyes...)
SK0102,252,Ogami, I can see my reflection in your eyes...
SK0102,253,Yeah, I can see myself in yours, too.
SK0102,254,Heheh... Oh, I'm a little embarrassed.
SK0102,255,The way you're looking at me, it's making me blush.
SK0102,256,(Sakura looks really good in that kimono.)
SK0102,257,This kimono has so many memories attached to it.
SK0102,258,So I want to keep wearing it and treasuring it for a long time to come.
SK0102,259,You know, that navy uniform suits you really well, Ogami.
SK0102,260,(Has Sakura's chest... gotten bigger?)
SK0102,261,Ogami. Where exactly were you looking just now?
SK0102,262,Uhh, w-well...
SK0102,263,Make an excuse.
SK0102,264,I-I just... saw your outfit and was thinking how pretty it is...
SK0102,265,Is that so?
SK0102,266,Y-Yes, really!
SK0102,267,Well, that's fine then. It just seemed like you had a perverted look in your eye.
SK0102,268,Err... Well, you see...
SK0102,269,Ogami, you had better not be staring at me with that perverted look in your eye.
SK0102,270,It's pretty embarrassing for me, you know?
SK0102,271,I-I'm sorry. I'll be more careful.
SK0102,272,(I'd better stop leering like this. I don't want her to get angry again.)
SK0102,273,Just where are you looking, Ogami?
SK0102,274,I should get going. See you later, Sakura.
SK0102,275,Sure. Let's talk again later when we have more time.
SK0102,276,Ogami, spring is the season of meetings... Or, so they say.
SK0102,277,And today is the day of a new meeting for you and me.
SK0102,278,From here on, let's make some more fun memories together.
SK0102,279,Yeah.
SK0102,280,We'll make plenty of them.
SK0102,281,We're making another memory right now.
SK0102,282,Happy memories, fun memories, we'll make plenty of them.
SK0102,283,...Yes.
SK0102,284,We're making another memory right now, just talking to each other like this.
SK0102,285,That's true. It's a memory I'll treasure dearly.
SK0102,286,...
SK0102,287,...
SK0102,288,Perhaps we should get going soon, Ogami.
SK0102,289,Yeah, you're right. I was on my way to Manager Yoneda's office, anyway.
SK0102,290,Then I'll take my leave. Let's talk again later when we have more time.
SK0102,291,Guess I should get going, too.
SK0102,292,Such lovely weather. The spring sunshine is beaming down on everything.
SK0102,293,I wish I could relax here a while longer, but I really need to be going.
SK0102,294,Welcome! Is there anything I can get you? ...Oh!
SK0102,295,Ogami, is that you? Good to see you again! It's me, Tsubaki Takamura!
SK0102,296,It's good to see you too, Tsubaki. I've been stationed here at the theater again. I look forward to working with you.
SK0102,297,Yes, I heard about it from Mr. Yoneda! I could hardly wait to have you back.
SK0102,298,When all's said and done, you're by far my most loyal customer!
SK0102,299,Wh-What the... That's why you wanted to see me?
SK0102,300,Oh, by the way! Have you filled out your arrival paperwork yet, Ogami?
SK0102,301,No, not yet.
SK0102,302,Well that's not good! You're just making more trouble for Kasumi and Yuri!
SK0102,303,All right then, I'll bring you to the secretarial office. Come on, let's go!
SK0102,304,Hello there, Ogami! Would you like to buy something?
SK0102,305,Buy a photo.
SK0102,306,Talk to Tsubaki.
SK0102,307,Leave.
SK0102,308,Could I buy a photo?
SK0102,309,Ogami, didn't you buy one earlier?
SK0102,310,We need to keep enough in stock for the patrons, so please enjoy the one you bought for now.
SK0102,311,You'd like to buy a photo? Thank you very much!
SK0102,312,Oh right, I have a request to make, Ogami.
SK0102,313,We need to keep enough photos in stock for the patrons, so please limit your purchases to one per month.
SK0102,314,While I'm sure you'd like to collect more, I hope you'll understand the need to do this for the sake of our patrons.
SK0102,315,That's a photo of Sakura.
SK0102,316,It seems like Sakura was really looking forward to your return, Ogami.
SK0102,317,How about buying a photo to show your support for her?
SK0102,318,Let's see... Sakura's photo, right?
SK0102,319,That'll be 50 sen. Thank you very much!
SK0102,320,That's a photo of Sumire.
SK0102,321,Sumire is at her family's home right now.
SK0102,322,Let's see... Sumire's photo, right?
SK0102,323,That'll be 50 sen. Thank you very much!
SK0102,324,That's a photo of Maria.
SK0102,325,Maria's currently in America, escorting Count Hanakoji.
SK0102,326,Let's see... Maria's photo, right?
SK0102,327,That'll be 50 sen. Thank you very much!
SK0102,328,That's a photo of Kanna.
SK0102,329,Kanna's back home in Okinawa to do some karate training at the moment.
SK0102,330,Let's see... Kanna's photo, right?
SK0102,331,That'll be 50 sen. Thank you very much!
SK0102,332,That's a photo of Iris.
SK0102,333,I bet Iris would be pretty lonely without everybody in the Flower Division keeping her company.
SK0102,334,Make sure you're kind to her, Ogami.
SK0102,335,Let's see... Iris's photo, right?
SK0102,336,That'll be 50 sen. Thank you very much!
SK0102,337,That's a photo of Kohran.
SK0102,338,Kohran's off doing some work at the Hanayashiki branch right now.
SK0102,339,Let's see... Kohran's photo, right?
SK0102,340,That'll be 50 sen. Thank you very much!
SK0102,341,You don't want to buy anything? That's too bad...
SK0102,342,Ogami, did you know? The Flower Division will be putting on four performances this year.
SK0102,343,One each in summer, fall, winter, and spring. Every three months when the seasons turn, a new performance will debut.
SK0102,344,The next one, our summer performance, starts in June.
SK0102,345,I see, but why run the gift shop if there's no performance running right now?
SK0102,346,We do have some patrons who come to buy photos and such even when there's not a performance running.
SK0102,347,But that aside, I love working here. I get to see our patrons' smiling faces!
SK0102,348,Is that so? Tsubaki, you're incredible.
SK0102,349,So your ticket punching job will be on hold until June, Ogami.
SK0102,350,Hmm. I'm relieved, but also kind of sad.
SK0102,351,Well, I should be going. Keep up the good work.
SK0102,352,Thanks very much! Come back soon!
SK0102,353,Thank you very much! Come back and buy another photo next month!
SK0102,354,This entryway seems to be exclusively for VIP patrons.
SK0102,355,Doesn't seem to be anyone here. I should go.
SK0102,356,Huh? No one's here, but something smells amazing.
SK0102,357,Someone must have been cooking in here just a little while ago.
SK0102,358,Yep, no one else here. Was someone making food?
SK0102,359,Come to think of it, I'm getting hungry. Well, it is almost noon.
SK0102,360,Oh yeah, I only have until 12 o'clock to go to the manager's office. I'd better not be late.
SK0102,361,The dining hall seems a little different than before.
SK0102,362,Kanna was always in here, chowing down. Man, that takes me back.
SK0102,363,Whenever there's a performance going on, this lobby is jam-packed with people.
SK0102,364,But since there's no performance today, I guess there aren't any visitors, either.
SK0102,365,So this is the stage where the Imperial Assault Troupe's Flower Division holds their performances, huh?
SK0102,366,I'll get to see Sakura and the others singing and dancing up on this stage again.
SK0102,367,This must be the theater's entrance hall. From the moment I pass through here, I become an employee of the theater, too.
SK0102,368,As captain of the Flower Division, I must strive to work as hard as I did on my very first day here.
SK0102,369,OK, guess I'll head into the manager's office.
SK0102,370,Ogami.
SK0102,371,It's been quite some time, Ogami. Do you remember me? I'm Kasumi Fujii, from the secretarial office.
SK0102,372,Of course I do, Kasumi. It has been a while.
SK0102,373,Yes, I heard as much from Mr. Yoneda. We're grateful to have you back.
SK0102,374,By the way, Ogami, have you filled out your arrival forms yet?
SK0102,375,Uh, I haven't...
SK0102,376,I thought that may be the case. Well, please come to the secretarial office so we can get the formalities out of the way.
SK0102,377,Oh, Mon Frère. What are you up to?
SK0102,378,I thought I'd go visit everyone's rooms.
SK0102,379,Everyone who isn't here right now locked their rooms, so you can't get in.
SK0102,380,Oh, that's right, everyone's gone.
SK0102,381,So, are you feeling lonely 'cause everyone's gone?
SK0102,382,You're here Iris, so I'm fine.
SK0102,383,I can hold out a little longer.
SK0102,384,Yeah, I'm lonely.
SK0102,385,Yes, but you're here, Iris, so I'm fine.
SK0102,386,Really?! Eheheh. Thanks, Mon Frère!
SK0102,387,I'm not lonely either, 'cause you're here!
SK0102,388,Yes, but I can hold out a little longer.
SK0102,389,Yeah. I'm gonna hold on, too.
SK0102,390,I thought everyone would be here, so... Yeah, I'm lonely.
SK0102,391,Yeah... It is pretty lonely, huh?
SK0102,392,But everyone's supposed to be coming back this summer. So let's hold on until then.
SK0102,393,Yeah, that's true. You know, I think you cheered me up a bit, Iris.
SK0102,394,...
SK0102,395,Mon Frère...
SK0102,396,Iris. There are times when, even if you're feeling lonely, you can't say it out loud.
SK0102,397,When summer comes, everyone will start coming back, and summer is just around the corner.
SK0102,398,...Yeah.
SK0102,399,Hee hee! I think I feel a little better after talking with you, Mon Frère!
SK0102,400,OK, I'm gonna go now! Bye-bye!
SK0102,401,And here's my room.
SK0102,402,My new life begins today, right here.
SK0102,403,Go somewhere else.
SK0102,404,Enter.
SK0102,405,I can come back to my room any time. Maybe I'll go somewhere else.
SK0102,406,OK, time to head inside.
SK0102,407,(What the? It's locked from the inside.)
SK0102,408,Hey! Is someone in there?
SK0102,409,Guess whooo?
SK0102,410,Iris?
SK0102,411,Sakura?
SK0102,412,Iris?
SK0102,413,Sakura?
SK0102,414,Mr. Yoneda?
SK0102,415,That voice. Iris?
SK0102,416,Heheh, nope.
SK0102,417,Oh, so it was you, Sakura.
SK0102,418,I completely thought that was Iris. You're quite the actress.
SK0102,419,Heheheh, thank you for the compliment.
SK0102,420,Anyway, what are you doing in my room, Sakura?
SK0102,421,Well, I was cleaning it up. Come on in!
SK0102,422,That voice. Sakura?
SK0102,423,Heheh, that's right.
SK0102,424,Sorry, I just felt like teasing you a bit.
SK0102,425,But you recognized my voice even though I was imitating Iris.
SK0102,426,Of course I know your voice.
SK0102,427,Thank you. Eheh, that makes me happy to hear.
SK0102,428,That voice, Mr. Yoneda?
SK0102,429,Wh... What?!
SK0102,430,Oh, so it was you, Sakura.
SK0102,431,Don't give me that! I can't believe you'd mistake me for Mr. Yoneda of all people.
SK0102,432,I-I was just kidding. There's no way I'd mistake your voice for his.
SK0102,433,A-Anyway, what are you doing in my room, Sakura?
SK0102,434,Heheh, I guess I am kind of glad I was able to fool you.
SK0102,435,Well, I was cleaning it up. Come on in!
SK0102,436,Time's up! Too bad.
SK0102,437,Oh, so it was you, Sakura.
SK0102,438,Heheheh, sorry. I just felt like teasing you a bit.
SK0102,439,Anyway, what are you doing in my room, Sakura?
SK0102,440,Well, I was cleaning it up. Come on in!
SK0102,441,Wow, it's just like the way I left it.
SK0102,442,I aired out your futon and polished up the floor until it shined.
SK0102,443,Thank you, Sakura.
SK0102,444,Ogami...
SK0102,445,...
SK0102,446,I'm hopeless. I know I just said that we shouldn't act like lovers...
SK0102,447,...but when I'm around you, I get so excited...I'm sorry.
SK0102,448,Sakura...
SK0102,449,Ogami...
SK0102,450,Sakura...
SK0102,451,I... I should be going.
SK0102,452,W-Well then, please excuse me.
SK0102,453,Oh, of course. See you later, Sakura.
SK0102,454,Sakura...
SK0102,455,Starting today, this will be my room.
SK0102,456,I wish I could take it easy, but I need to go visit the manager's office first.
SK0102,457,Hey-Mon-Frère! What're you up to?
SK0102,458,Hey, Iris. I'm just taking a walk around the theater.
SK0102,459,Hey, hey, you should talk to me, then!
SK0102,460,(Her hair is a little unruly, but it's a lovely golden blonde.)
SK0102,461,Mon Frère, is there something wrong with my hair?
SK0102,462,No, not at all. I was only thinking how pretty it looks.
SK0102,463,Hee hee, thanks! Yaaay, Mon Frère complimented me!!
SK0102,464,I think your hair is cool, too!
SK0102,465,(Iris's huge ribbon is an iconic part of her look.)
SK0102,466,Isn't my ribbon cute?
SK0102,467,It is. That ribbon really suits you, Iris.
SK0102,468,Thank you, Mon Frère. Hearing you say that makes me really happy!
SK0102,469,(I wouldn't mind seeing Iris without her ribbon, too.)
SK0102,470,(Such pretty blue eyes. She looks just like a doll.)
SK0102,471,What is it, Mon Frère? You've been staring into my eyes for a while now.
SK0102,472,Ooh, I know! You wanna have a staring contest, right? OK, let's do it! Ready? Go!
SK0102,473,Hmmm....
SK0102,474,(These cute clothes are just Iris's style.)
SK0102,475,Since I turned 11, I've gotten taller!
SK0102,476,So Sakura fixed up my clothes to make them fit me better.
SK0102,477,(Oh, come on, Ogami! What are you looking at?!)
SK0102,478,Mon Frère, what were you looking at just now?!
SK0102,479,Uh, I just... Hahaha... Sorry.
SK0102,480,If you did that with Maria or one of the other girls, they'd be really mad!
SK0102,481,(I never learn, do I... Man, I feel pathetic.)
SK0102,482,You're always with Jean-Paul, aren't you, Iris?
SK0102,483,Yup! Jean-Paul has been been with me ever since I lived in France!
SK0102,484,Oh, right! Mon Frère, don't forget to say hello to him, too.
SK0102,485,Of course...
SK0102,486,Speak to him.
SK0102,487,Shake his paw.
SK0102,488,It's a pleasure to work with you again, Jean-Paul.
SK0102,489,Hee hee! Thanks, Mon Frère!
SK0102,490,I'm sure Jean-Paul is pleased, too!
SK0102,491,All right, Jean-Paul, how about a handshake?
SK0102,492,Let's both do our best to help Iris from here on out.
SK0102,493,Thanks, Mon Frère!
SK0102,494,How nice, Jean-Paul! Mon Frère shook your paw!
SK0102,495,What's wrong, Mon Frère? Here, come say hello to Jean-Paul, too!
SK0102,496,Uh, r-right... Hello, Jean-Paul.
SK0102,497,If you don't get it together, then Jean-Paul will laugh at you, Mon Frère!
SK0102,498,You and Jean-Paul are really close, aren't you?
SK0102,499,Yup! But you don't need to worry, Mon Frère.
SK0102,500,Jean-Paul may be my friend, but you're still my boyfriend!
SK0102,501,So make sure to get along with him, OK?
SK0102,502,What are you looking at, Mon Frère?
SK0102,503,You keep looking away, Mon Frère! Are you tired of talking to me?
SK0102,504,N-No, that's not the case at all.
SK0102,505,(If I look away again, it'll make her angry. I'd better be careful.)
SK0102,506,Well, I'd better get going, Iris.
SK0102,507,What? You're leaving already? Come on, stay and talk with me for a little longer!
SK0102,508,Hey, Mon Frère. How do you like the new stuff we did to the theater?
SK0102,509,I haven't been around to every room yet, but it seems like you updated all kinds of things.
SK0102,510,Yeah! I really wanna dance on the new stage!
SK0102,511,We're gonna get a whooole lot of customers...
SK0102,512,...so I bet your ticket punching job will get pretty hard.
SK0102,513,O-Oh, that's right. I do have to go back to punching tickets, don't I...
SK0102,514,I bet that might be kinda hard, since you haven't done it for a whole year.
SK0102,515,We all have to do rehearsal for our performances, so maybe you can rehearse for your job too.
SK0102,516,OK, I'm gonna go now. Bye-bye, Mon Frère!
SK0102,517,Rehearse for ticket-punching, huh? Well, it has been a pretty long time.
SK0102,518,Though at the rate things are going, I'm gonna get roped into doing all sorts of odd jobs again...
SK0102,519,A game room. This place looks pretty new.
SK0102,520,There's even a pool table? Wow, this is the real thing.
SK0102,521,Oh, Sakura! Are you done getting ready?
SK0102,522,I still have a bit more to do. How about you, Iris?
SK0102,523,Those voices, is that Sakura and Iris?
SK0102,524,It kind of sounds like... someone's talking in the salon next door.
SK0102,525,I'm almost finished. Do you want some help, Sakura?
SK0102,526,Thanks, Iris. But I've only got a little bit left, so don't worry about it.
SK0102,527,Hee hee! Mon Frère is really back, huh?
SK0102,528,I'm so happy that... I'm gonna cry again.
SK0102,529,Iris...
SK0102,530,Say something.
SK0102,531,Were you two talking about me just now?
SK0102,532,O-Ogami?!
SK0102,533,Mon Frère, were you... listening to us?
SK0102,534,No, I couldn't hear you all that well. What were you talking about?
SK0102,535,O-Oh, nothing much.
SK0102,536,Iris, shouldn't we get going?
SK0102,537,Y-Yeah. Bye, Mon Frère!
SK0102,538,Hey, you two... And they're gone.
SK0102,539,Oh well, I suppose I'll head somewhere else.
SK0102,540,(Maybe I'll stay here.)
SK0102,541,Mon Frère, he's really cool, and super duper nice.
SK0102,542,Yes, he is. I... feel the same way.
SK0102,543,Well, why don't we both do our best to get things ready for him?
SK0102,544,Y-Yeah.
SK0102,545,OK, I'm gonna go now. Keep up the good work, Sakura!
SK0102,546,Thanks, Iris. See you later.
SK0102,547,...
SK0102,548,I don't have time to hang around here. I need to head to the manager's office.
SK0102,549,Huh? I wonder whose room this is.
SK0102,550,No answer. It must be unoccupied.
SK0102,551,There's no point in wasting time here. I should get moving.
SK0102,552,This must be Sakura's room. I wonder if she's here.
SK0102,553,Looks like she's not in.
SK0102,554,Since Sakura's not here, I should go someplace else.
SK0102,555,It's just like Sakura to have a cute nameplate like this.
SK0102,556,It's Kanna's room. I guess she's still in Okinawa doing karate training.
SK0102,557,It's not like she's here, anyway.
SK0102,558,There's no reason to hang around since Kanna's gone. I'll go somewhere else.
SK0102,559,A nametag is hanging on the door, almost as if it's standing guard over Kanna's room in her absence.
SK0102,560,There's no nameplate on the door. I wonder whose room this is.
SK0102,561,No answer. It must be unoccupied.
SK0102,562,There's no point in wasting time here. I should get moving.
SK0102,563,This is Maria's room. Apparently she's in America, escorting Count Hanakoji.
SK0102,564,It's not like she's here, anyway.
SK0102,565,There's no reason to hang around since Maria's gone. I'll go somewhere else.
SK0102,566,It's Maria's nameplate.
SK0102,567,Here's Iris's room.
SK0102,568,Hey, Iris!
SK0102,569,No response. I guess she's not here.
SK0102,570,I'm running short on time, so I should get going soon.
SK0102,571,So Iris's nameplate is shaped like Jean-Paul.
SK0102,572,This is Kohran's room. If I remember correctly, she's at the Hanayashiki branch at the moment.
SK0102,573,It's not like she's here, anyway.
SK0102,574,Guess I'll leave. No reason to be here if Kohran's not in.
SK0102,575,A gear-shaped nameplate, huh? It's just Kohran's style.
SK0102,576,This is Sumire's room. Seems like she went back to her family home for the time being.
SK0102,577,Well, she's not exactly here right now.
SK0102,578,I'm almost out of time, so I'd better get going.
SK0102,579,This is a pretty subtle design, considering it's Sumire.
SK0102,580,I think this was the room that Ayame used...
SK0102,581,Ayame... I've come back to the theater again.
SK0102,582,I may make a lot of mistakes at first, but... I'll do my best.
SK0102,583,I won't do anything that would've made you tell me to "keep it together."
SK0102,584,...
SK0102,585,All right, I guess I should get going.
SK0102,586,I should go. I need to be heading to the manager's office about now.
SK0102,587,No one's using this room right now.
SK0102,588,I should go. I need to be heading to the manager's office about now.
SK0102,589,This must be the library. Maybe I'll come back here and relax with a book once I've got some free time.
SK0102,590,But for now, I should head to the manager's office.
SK0102,591,This is where the members of the Flower Division come to relax. I remember always seeing Sumire drinking tea in here.
SK0102,592,No one's around, too bad. Guess I'll head somewhere else.
SK0102,593,This is the 2nd floor theater seating entrance. There's always a ton of patrons here during performances, too.
SK0102,594,It's pretty empty right now, though. No reason to stay here, so I'll go somewhere else.
SK0102,595,You can see the street out in front of the theater from this terrace. It's awash in spring sunshine.
SK0102,596,This is the perfect weather for sunbathing, but I can't hang around here for long.
SK0102,597,Looking out over the cityscape of the capital like this, it's finally starting to hit me that I've returned.
SK0102,598,OK, I'd better get moving. Going to the manager's office is my top priority right now.
SK0102,599,Of course a theater as big as this one would have second-floor seating.
SK0102,600,I'm willing to bet that the stage looks a bit different from up here.
SK0102,601,This must be the theater's attic. The air is pretty chilly up here, and it's really quiet.
SK0102,602,Obviously there's no one here. I should head back.
SK0102,603,There's no one here. No one but mice, I'd bet.
SK0102,604,I should get going. I don't have time to dawdle.
SK0102,605,All right, time to go meet the manager.
SK0102,606,I should go meet with the manager first.
SK0102,607,It's Ogami. Are you in, Mr. Yoneda?
SK0102,608,Ah, Ogami? Come in.
SK0102,609,Yes, sir. Pardon me!
SK0102,610,Today at 1200, I, Ichiro Ogami, newly reinstated to the Imperial Assault Troupe, am reporting for duty!
SK0102,611,You're here awfully early. You couldn't have greeted everyone by now, could you?
SK0102,612,Oho, you're here right on time. Nicely done.
SK0102,613,You numbskull! 12 o'clock came and went a long time ago!
SK0102,614,I-I'm sorry. I was wandering around the theater and the time got away from me.
SK0102,615,Good grief, late on your first day. You're hopeless.
SK0102,616,Now then, Ogami. From today on, you'll be serving as the Flower Division's captain here at the theater.
SK0102,617,The girls of the Flower Division normally live and perform here as members of the "Imperial Assault Troupe."
SK0102,618,However, when trouble arises, they launch into battle as members of a unit also known as the "Imperial Assault Troupe."
SK0102,619,Its captain carries a tremendous weight. At the theater you perform thankless work while serving as commander in battle.
SK0102,620,I have no doubt you're overjoyed to be back with the Flower Division, but keep your wits about you all the same.
SK0102,621,Yes, sir. Understood!
SK0102,622,Right, that's all. Oh, wait... You stand out quite a bit in that Navy uniform.
SK0102,623,Here, change into this when you get to your room.
SK0102,624,Whoa, these clothes bring back some memories.
SK0102,625,I think it's finally starting to hit me that I'm captain of the Flower Division again.
SK0102,626,Wahaha! Is that right? In that case, I'm glad I kept that outfit around.
SK0102,627,Well then, I'm going to go change. Please excuse me.
SK0102,628,Understood. I'm finally going back to work as captain of the Flower Division.
SK0102,629,Well then, I'm going to go change. Please excuse me.
SK0102,630,Oh, Sakura... And Iris, too. What are you both doing?
SK0102,631,We waited here until you were done talking.
SK0102,632,Come to think of it, something similar happened when I first arrived here two years ago.
SK0102,633,Were you two eavesdropping again, like you did back then?
SK0102,634,Ogami, don't tease us! We were just waiting outside, like normal.
SK0102,635,If you're going back to your room, would you like me to accompany you?
SK0102,636,No way! I can go back with him. C'mon, Mon Frère!
SK0102,637,Go with Sakura.
SK0102,638,Go with Iris.
SK0102,639,Go with both of them.
SK0102,640,OK then, let's go together, Sakura.
SK0102,641,Yes, I'd be happy to!
SK0102,642,Sorry, Iris. Sakura's going to come with me, so...
SK0102,643,Mon Frère, do you not like me?
SK0102,644,Uh, no, I... That's not...
SK0102,645,...
SK0102,646,Ogami, why don't you, me, and Iris all go together?
SK0102,647,How does that sound, Iris?
SK0102,648,...OK!
SK0102,649,All right then. Let's go, Ogami.
SK0102,650,OK then, why don't you take me there, Iris?
SK0102,651,OK! Come on, let's go, Mon Frère!
SK0102,652,Sorry Sakura, but I'm going to let Iris take me.
SK0102,653,That's too bad. Well, go ahead with her, then.
SK0102,654,She was pretty lonely without you here, after all.
SK0102,655,OK, Iris. Make sure you escort him safely to his room.
SK0102,656,Thank you, Sakura!
SK0102,657,OK Mon Frère. Let us depart now!
SK0102,658,OK then, why don't both of you accompany me? We can all go together.
SK0102,659,Yeah!
SK0102,660,That sounds good. We're all friends, so let's go together.
SK0102,661,All right then. Let's go, Ogami.
SK0102,662,Hmm. What to do...
SK0102,663,Well, how about this? Iris and I can both take you to your room.
SK0102,664,Is that OK, Iris?
SK0102,665,Yeah, that's OK with me! Let's all go together!
SK0102,666,OK, let us depart now!
SK0102,667,So starting today, this'll be my room.
SK0102,668,Hey Mon Frère, um, we've been keeping a secret from you.
SK0102,669,We're holding a welcome back party for you backstage!
SK0102,670,Huh?! A welcome back party for me?
SK0102,671,I'm sorry we didn't say anything until now. We wanted it to be a surprise, so we kept it a secret.
SK0102,672,Hee hee! I helped out a whoooole bunch!
SK0102,673,I see. Thank you for going to all that trouble for me.
SK0102,674,Well, I'm going to get changed real quick, so hold on just a minute.
SK0102,675,All right. Iris, let's wait outside.
SK0102,676,OK! We'll be waiting, so hurry and get changed!
SK0102,677,Well then, I guess I'd better hurry and change clothes.
SK0102,678,First things first, I need to take off my naval uniform.
SK0102,679,Get undressed in a hurry
SK0102,680,Get undressed carefully
SK0102,681,I don't want to keep Iris waiting. I'd better get changed in a hurry.
SK0102,682,OK, my naval uniform's off.
SK0102,683,We shouldn't rush things like that. I'll get changed carefully.
SK0102,684,OK, my naval uniform's off.
SK0102,685,Crap, I spaced out for a second. I can't keep them waiting; I've gotta hurry!
SK0102,686,OK, my naval uniform's off.
SK0102,687,Tie the necktie.
SK0102,688,Put on the shirt.
SK0102,689,Tie the necktie.
SK0102,690,Put on the shirt.
SK0102,691,Fold the clothes.
SK0102,692,OK, let's tie this necktie...
SK0102,693,Ack! I just realized I haven't put on my shirt yet!
SK0102,694,Damn it, what a waste of time! Now I've gotta untie this necktie and put my shirt on.
SK0102,695,OK, my shirt's on now, and I'll slip on my vest too while I'm at it.
SK0102,696,Oh, right. I should take a moment to fold my uniform properly.
SK0102,697,There, it's folded. Now to put on my shirt and vest.
SK0102,698,Ah... Shoot. What am I doing, standing around stark naked like this?
SK0102,699,I need to hurry up and get my shirt and vest on.
SK0102,700,All right, I've got my shirt on, and my necktie is tied. Next, I'll...
SK0102,701,Open the door.
SK0102,702,Put on pants.
SK0102,703,Sorry to keep you waiting! I'm done changing.
SK0102,704,Hm, things feel a bit drafty below my waist...
SK0102,705,Oh, crap! I can't believe I forgot to put on pants!
SK0102,706,It'd be a scandal if anyone saw me like this. I need to put them on right now!
SK0102,707,Hm, things feel a bit drafty below my waist...
SK0102,708,Ack! It looks like I haven't put on my pants yet!
SK0102,709,It'd be a scandal if anyone saw me like this. I need to put them on right now!
SK0102,710,There we go, this should be perfect. Clothes changed successfully!
SK0102,711,Open the door.
SK0102,712,Comb hair.
SK0102,713,Open the door.
SK0102,714,Sorry to keep you waiting! I'm done changing.
SK0102,715,Oh, wait... I just finished changing, so I should comb my hair.
SK0102,716,There, that should do it. Sorry to keep you waiting! I'm done changing.
SK0102,717,Eh, that's good enough. Sorry to keep you waiting! I'm done changing.
SK0102,718,Mon Frère, are you done changing?
SK0102,719,Oooh, Mon Frère, you look so cool!
SK0102,720,Ogami, that outfit suits you well.
SK0102,721,Oh, you finished getting changed!
SK0102,722,You know, Ogami, that outfit really does suit you.
SK0102,723,Uh, Mon Frère, you're still in your underpants...
SK0102,724,Ack! C-Crap!
SK0102,725,Ahh! I-I'm so sorry!
SK0102,726,Iris, l-let's go back outside!
SK0102,727,Aw, come on, Mon Frère! Hurry up!
SK0102,728,Ahh jeez, I can't believe they saw me looking like that.
SK0102,729,Whoa! J-Just hang on a second!
SK0102,730,Eeeek! O-Ogami, you're still naked?!
SK0102,731,I-I'm in the middle of changing!
SK0102,732,Sheesh! You change slower than I do, Mon Frère!
SK0102,733,You better hurry up or I'm gonna leave!
SK0102,734,Oh, good grief... I give up.
SK0102,735,Of all the days I could've embarrassed myself like this, it had to be on my first day back.
SK0102,736,Huh? Mon Frère, why aren't you changed yet?
SK0102,737,Oh, uh... I just got lost in thought.
SK0102,738,Come onnn! I told you to hurry up and get changed!
SK0102,739,Mon Frère, you dummy! If you don't go faster, I'm gonna leave! I mean it!
SK0102,740,*sigh* I guess I've been taking my sweet time here, no matter how you slice it...
SK0102,741,Ah! You even folded your old clothes up! You're amazing, Mon Frère!
SK0102,742,That's just like you, Ogami. I'm impressed, too.
SK0102,743,Thanks. Well then, shall we be going?
SK0102,744,Oooh, you didn't fold your clothes! That's no good, Mon Frère. You need to fold them nicely.
SK0102,745,Oh my, Iris. You're being pretty cheeky today, aren't you?
SK0102,746,S-Sorry. I'll do better next time.
SK0102,747,But, my clothes are scattered all over the place now.
SK0102,748,That's true. Ogami, you really should fold them up.
SK0102,749,Sorry. I was in such a hurry. I'll be more careful from now on.
SK0102,750,Thanks for waiting. I'm all changed, so we can go anytime.
SK0102,751,Yaaay, let's go, let's go! We're gonna go to the backstage room. Come on, hurryyyy!
SK0102,752,Heheheh. Iris certainly is in high spirits.
SK0102,753,Hey now, Iris, don't tug my hand so hard.
SK0102,754,Come on already, hurry, hurry! This is your welcome back party, after all!
SK0102,755,Over here, Mon Frère! Go inside!
SK0102,756,Tah-daaahh! Mon Frère has arrived!
SK0102,757,Wow, this is incredible! You've all done a great job of decorating this room; it looks great.
SK0102,758,Mon Frère, over here! Look, this is your seat.
SK0102,759,Ehem, now then. Here's to welcoming Ichiro Ogami back into the Flower Division.
SK0102,760,Cheers!
SK0102,761,Hoorayyy! Now Mon Frère and I can be together allll the time!
SK0102,762,Ogami.
SK0102,763,welcome back...
SK0102,764,...to the Imperial Theater!!
SK0102,765,We all look forward to working alongside you from here on, Ogami.
SK0102,766,Thank you, everyone. Let's all work hard together as members of the Imperial Assault Troupe.
SK0102,767,All right, that's enough of the formalities for now. Let's drink!
SK0102,768,I'll have plenty of busywork to put you to starting tomorrow.
SK0102,769,But tonight's for lettin' yer hair down! Have a little fun! Wahahaha!
SK0102,770,Oh, shoot, I nearly forgot something important.
SK0102,771,I better tell you all before I get too drunk.
SK0102,772,What is it, sir?
SK0102,773,Truth is, we've got another new member joining us today besides Ogami.
SK0102,774,Huh? Really?!
SK0102,775,She's a 17 year old girl from Italy. I hope you'll all get along with her.
SK0102,776,Really?! So the Flower Division is gaining a new member!
SK0102,777,What do you think she's like, Ogami? I'm excited to meet her.
SK0102,778,I bet she'll be a strange one...
SK0102,779,We should try to be friendly with her.
SK0102,780,I hope she's cute.
SK0102,781,I wonder, if she's joining the Flower Division, I bet she'll be a strange one...
SK0102,782,...Ogami, are you implying that the rest of us are strange, too?
SK0102,783,Hey, I'm not strange!
SK0102,784,Huh?! No, that's not what I meant...
SK0102,785,If she just arrived in Japan, there must be a lot she doesn't know. We should try to be friendly with her and help her out.
SK0102,786,That's true. When I first came here from Sendai, I was pretty nervous, myself.
SK0102,787,Teamwork is more important than anything in the Flower Division, so let's try to get along with her.
SK0102,788,A 17 year old girl... I hope she's cute.
SK0102,789,Ogami, just what do you mean by that?
SK0102,790,Oh, uh... W-Well, as captain...
SK0102,791,Oh, forget it!
SK0102,792,(Whoops, guess that was too frivolous for my own good.)
SK0102,793,I wonder what she's like; I can't even begin to guess.
SK0102,794,Me either. I hope we'll be able to get along.
SK0102,795,All right, everybody, let me introduce our new recruit.
SK0102,796,This is Orihime Soletta, the newest member of the Flower Division.
SK0102,797,Ciao! I am Orihime Soletta. Nice to meet you all.
SK0102,798,Call me Orihime, if you please.
SK0102,799,The Soletta family is part of what Italy calls the "Red Aristocracy." They're essentially nobility.
SK0102,800,That's right！
SK0102,801,Whoa, that's incredible.
SK0102,802,These three are Kasumi, Yuri, and Tsubaki. They do the theater's office work.
SK0102,803,And this is Sakura and Iris, both members of the Flower Division.
SK0102,804,I'm Sakura Shinguji. It's nice to meet you.
SK0102,805,Hello!! I'm Iris! And this is my bear, Jean-Paul. Let's be friends!
SK0102,806,Everyone, I am in your kind hands now!
SK0102,807,Finally, this is Ichiro Ogami, the captain of the Imperial Assault Troupe, Flower Division.
SK0102,808,Give a serious greeting.
SK0102,809,Give a casual greeting.
SK0102,810,Pleased to meet you. I'm Imperial Navy Ensign Ichiro Ogami.
SK0102,811,I serve as captain of the Imperial Assault Troupe's Flower Division. I look forward to working with you.
SK0102,812,...
SK0102,813,Hm? Orihime?
SK0102,814,Ensign, I will be frank with you. I do not like Japanese men.
SK0102,815,Japanese men, they are all soft, weak-willed, and shifty.
SK0102,816,Maybe you are the captain or what have you, but I will ask you now not to get in my way.
SK0102,817,O-Orihime...
SK0102,818,Ciao, Orihime! I'm Ensign Ichiro Ogami of the Imperial Navy.
SK0102,819,I just returned to the Imperial Assault Troupe today myself. I hope we'll get along.
SK0102,820,...
SK0102,821,Well then, how about a handshake for now?
SK0102,822,Or perhaps, like they taught us at the military academy, a kiss on the back of the hand may be better?
SK0102,823,...Ensign, I have never thought of Japanese men as any better than cockroaches.
SK0102,824,So to begin, I have a word for you: idiot!
SK0102,825,O-Orihime...
SK0102,826,...
SK0102,827,How sullen you are. If there is something you wish to say, then why not say it?
SK0102,828,Truly, the Japanese have lowly, ill-mannered, shallow men!
SK0102,829,All right, all right, that's enough for introductions. Orihime, Ogami, both of you sit down.
SK0102,830,Wh-What is this? The floor is made out of grass?!
SK0102,831,Heheh, I suppose you wouldn't know since you're from Italy.
SK0102,832,This is called "tatami." It's a part of Japanese culture.
SK0102,833,Hmph, so the Japanese live their lives on top of grass. How strange.
SK0102,834,This theater is run-down, and it all feels so very shabby!
SK0102,835,Ahh, it makes me long for the elegant splendor of the Roman theater!
SK0102,836,Ooh, Orihime, you've been to the theater in Rome?
SK0102,837,Yes. Not only in Rome, but in very famous theaters all about Europe.
SK0102,838,And all of them, always filled to the brim with guests far and wide.
SK0102,839,Wow, that's incredible.
SK0102,840,Well, I'm sure there must be a lot of things you don't know since you only just arrived in Japan.
SK0102,841,I'm always willing to lend a helping hand, so if you have any questions, just ask.
SK0102,842,Hmmm. A helping hand, you say?
SK0102,843,I will be returning now to my room!
SK0102,844,I cannot be bothered with any more of this.
SK0102,845,O-Orihime! What's the matter?!
SK0102,846,Hmph, nothing much. Being here has simply bored me is all, and so I'm going back.
SK0102,847,O-Orihime, wait a second!
SK0102,848,If I said something to offend you, I apologize.
SK0102,849,Humph, speaking to a Japanese man any longer than this is only a waste of my time.
SK0102,850,Now, I will be on my way.
SK0102,851,(O-Orihime!)
SK0102,852,Call out to her.
SK0102,853,Chase after her.
SK0102,854,Call out to her.
SK0102,855,Orihimeeee!
SK0102,856,...
SK0102,857,It's no good; she's already gone.
SK0102,858,Ogami, what in the world is going on with Orihime?
SK0102,859,Hmm...
SK0102,860,(Good grief. I only just returned to the theater, and things are already off to a bad start.)
SK0102,861,Sorry, everyone, I'm going after her.
SK0102,862,Of course. Don't mind us, Ogami, just see to Orihime for now!
SK0102,863,Thanks. I'll be back.
SK0102,864,Orihime! Just wait a minute!
SK0102,865,Oh my, Ensign? You chased me all this way?
SK0102,866,O-Of course. Starting today, you're a part of the Flower Division, after all.
SK0102,867,I-I'm not entirely sure what I did to offend you...
SK0102,868,...but everyone was pretty worried after you got angry and stormed off like that.
SK0102,869,Ensign, I would not like for you to misunderstand.
SK0102,870,I do not have any intention of becoming a part of the Flower Division!
SK0102,871,Huh?!
SK0102,872,In fact, none of you are worthy of more than playing the foil to my stardom!
SK0102,873,Wh-What'd you say?!
SK0102,874,Hoho... And Ensign, when it comes to Japanese men such as yourself...
SK0102,875,...the thought of you hanging around me gives me chicken skin!
SK0102,876,You are like the rainy season of Japan. I would prefer that you not follow me around!
SK0102,877,Ah, Orihime!
SK0102,878,(Good grief. I only just returned to the theater, and things are already off to a bad start.)
SK0102,879,Ogami, are you sure you shouldn't go after her?
SK0102,880,Ah, I wouldn't be able to catch up with her now, anyway.
SK0102,881,I suppose, but even so...
SK0102,882,Ogami, what in the world is going on with Orihime?
SK0102,883,Hmm...
SK0102,884,(Good grief, I only just returned to the theater, and things are already off to a bad start.)
SK0102,885,Sorry, Ogami, but each customer is only allowed to purchase one photo at a time.
SK0102,886,I see. That's too bad.
SK0102,887,My apologies, Ogami, but each customer is only allowed to purchase one photo at a time.
SK0102,888,Oh, really? That's too bad.
SK0102,889,The jewel of the Pandemonium Regalia, entrusted to us by the Rose Division.

SK0102,932,... "" "" () - . , ! ? ?! !!
SK0103,1,It's 9 o'clock already, huh?
SK0103,2,It's my first night back in this theater, then.
SK0103,3,Even so, so much has happened today, hasn't it?
SK0103,4,W-What's that sound?!
SK0103,5,The sounds are coming from this machine. What is it?
SK0103,6,Whoa! Something appeared on the screen!
SK0103,7,A-hoy, Chief! Ya hear me? Kohran here!
SK0103,8,Man, it's really you, Chief.
SK0103,9,Haven't seen you for so long.
SK0103,10,Kohran... It has been a long time. Glad to see that you're doing good.
SK0103,11,Is that you, Kohran?　Thanks for coming after me earlier.
SK0103,12,Hehe, it's not a big deal, Chief.
SK0103,13,By the way, what's this machine?
SK0103,14,Hehe, surprised, aren't ya?　This is my invention, the "Cinematron"!
SK0103,15,So this is the present you were talking about, right?
SK0103,16,Yup! Glad you like it.
SK0103,17,This is a steam-powered communication tool called the Cinematron.
SK0103,18,I'll teach you how to use it.
SK0103,19,First, tune the "Call Number" of the person you want to reach with the "Main Dial" in the middle.
SK0103,20,Next, press the "Call" button on the upper right.
SK0103,21,If you want to end your call, press the "Power" button.
SK0103,22,The ones right here are "Speed Dials." You can quickly connect to a person you've reached before with these buttons.
SK0103,23,There may be some times where the person can't respond to your call, though. Easy, right?
SK0103,24,Uhm... I get it, kind of.
SK0103,25,Okie-dokie! Now let's get to practicing. Practice makes perfect!
SK0103,26,How about you try to reach me over at Hanayashiki, Chief?
SK0103,27,Our Call Number is "13700."
SK0103,28,I'll wait for yer call. You can do it, Chief.
SK0103,29,OK, time to test it. Tune the dial first, then press the "Call" button.
SK0103,30,13700, right?　OK, I'll try.
SK0103,31,Oops, I should press this button later when I'm gonna end the call.
SK0103,32,I can't reach her. Did I dial the wrong number?
SK0103,33,Hanayashiki's number was 13700, right? Let's try again.
SK0103,34,Hello? This is Hanayashiki.
SK0103,35,Oh, Chief! You managed to call me by yourself!
SK0103,36,Well, I managed somehow.
SK0103,37,OK, let's move to the big screen so we can talk.
SK0103,38,Can ya hear me, Chief?
SK0103,39,Yeah, I can hear you. I can see your face, too.
SK0103,40,Great, I can hear you loud and clear, too.
SK0103,41,This is amazing. You can chat with another person from far away while seeing their face at the same time.
SK0103,42,Heh, it was no big deal. Making this baby was a piece of cake.
SK0103,43,Anyways, Chief, I thought I should let you know...
SK0103,44,I still have work to do over here, so I won't be back 'til summer.
SK0103,45,In the meantime, call me with your Cinematron, 'kay?
SK0103,46,Of course I'll call.
SK0103,47,What a pain...
SK0103,48,Of course, no problem. I'll call you again, 13700.
SK0103,49,Thanks, Chief. I'm... looking forward to it.
SK0103,50,Ugh, operating this thing is so complicated. This'll be a pain in the neck to learn.
SK0103,51,You won't learn anything with that attitude, Chief.
SK0103,52,Beside, isn't it rude to say something's "a pain" when people ask you for something?
SK0103,53,Uh, well... You have a point.
SK0103,54,Oh well, you can just gimme a call whenever you feel like it.
SK0103,55,OK, Kohran, got it.
SK0103,56,Earth to Chief, can ya hear me?
SK0103,57,Ah, s-sorry. I spaced out for a moment...
SK0103,58,Thanks for giving me this amazing tool, Kohran.
SK0103,59,Aw come on, that's too much. It's not a big deal if it's for you.
SK0103,60,Heeeey, Boss! Can you hear me? It's Kanna Kirishima.
SK0103,61,Kanna? Is that you, Kanna?
SK0103,62,Hehe, you bet. Long time no see, Boss.
SK0103,63,I feel like we just saw each other earlier.
SK0103,64,Man, it's really been a long time.
SK0103,65,I wanted to see you in person when you arrived, but sadly I had already left the capital. Sorry.
SK0103,66,Don't worry about it. Seeing you looking well is good enough for me.
SK0103,67,I see you have a Cinematron with you as well.
SK0103,68,Yeah, Kohran gave me one before I left for Okinawa.
SK0103,69,Hehe! Sorry to interrupt, but this is the power of my Cinematron for ya!
SK0103,70,You can talk to a bunch of people at the same time with this machine.
SK0103,71,I also gave the others one before they left, too.
SK0103,72,Huh? So, that means...
SK0103,73,Ohohohoho! You haven't forgotten about me, have you, Ensign?
SK0103,74,It is I, the Top Star of the Imperial Theater, Sumire Kanzaki.
SK0103,75,Thank you for sending me off earlier, Ensign.
SK0103,76,It is I, the Top Star of the Imperial Theater, Sumire Kanzaki.
SK0103,77,Pardon me for not contacting you earlier, Ensign.
SK0103,78,Sumire.
SK0103,79,How does is it feel to return to the theater after so long?
SK0103,80,I assume you would be twice as happy if I were there with you when you returned.
SK0103,81,Hey, hey, don't just assume things like that.
SK0103,82,My, your indecent manner of speaking hasn't changed at all, Kanna.
SK0103,83,Oh yeah, cactus woman? Well, you're always so full of yourself!
SK0103,84,That's enough, both of you!
SK0103,85,Can you hear my voice, Captain? It's me, Maria Tachibana.
SK0103,86,Maria! Of course I can hear you.
SK0103,87,Captain, thank you for seeing me off earlier.
SK0103,88,It's been a long time Captain. Seeing you lively as ever relieves me.
SK0103,89,Great to see you doing well too, Maria.
SK0103,90,I'm contacting you from a ship heading to New York.
SK0103,91,Amazing, isn't it?
SK0103,92,Even when I'm atop the waves, I can talk with you like this.
SK0103,93,It really is amazing. All thanks to Kohran's Cinematron.
SK0103,94,And because it was one of her inventions, we need to watch out in case they blow up in our faces.
SK0103,95,Aw man, that's a low blow, Sumire. 
SK0103,96,Ahahahaha...
SK0103,97,Anyways, Boss, I'm still training and won't be able to return for a while.
SK0103,98,Hit me up sometime, OK?
SK0103,99,OK. Good luck, Kanna.
SK0103,100,Thanks, Boss! See you later.
SK0103,101,Ensign, get this. I rushed home after I heard that my grandfather Tadayoshi got ill and collapsed.
SK0103,102,Turns out he's perfectly healthy and energetic! It was just a ruse to trick me into returning home!
SK0103,103,I-I see...
SK0103,104,Well, I could just sneak out I suppose.
SK0103,105,I hope we can meet at the theater soon. Now then, excuse me. 
SK0103,106,Things must be very hectic for you, Captain. And just when you returned. 
SK0103,107,Please, take care of everyone in the Flower Division.
SK0103,108,Of course, leave it to me.
SK0103,109,Thank you very much, Captain. I'll be going now.
SK0103,110,Me too, Chief, I have to go as well.
SK0103,111,Thanks, Kohran. I'll make good use of this Cinematron.
SK0103,112,Glad to hear that! 
SK0103,113,Later, Chief.
SK0103,114,This thing sure comes handy.
SK0103,115,Even though Kohran's the one who made it, it doesn't look very dangerous.
SK0103,116,...Ensign.
SK0103,117,Wah! You surprised me, Sumire! Is there something else you needed?
SK0103,118,I forgot to tell you something important.
SK0103,119,I never gave you my Call Number.
SK0103,120,My Call Number is "13800." May I ask you to give me a call?
SK0103,121,It's 13800, right? OK, I'll set it to my Speed Dial.
SK0103,122,Please reach me out when you have a moment, Ensign. I'll wait for your call.
SK0103,123,...Captain.
SK0103,124,Wah! You surprised me, Maria! Is there something else you needed?
SK0103,125,Sorry to bother you again, but I forgot to tell you something important.
SK0103,126,I want to give you my Call Number.
SK0103,127,My Call Number is "13900." Please let me know if anything happens.
SK0103,128,It's 13900, right? OK, I'll set it to my Speed Dial.
SK0103,129,I'm going to go now. Good night, Captain.
SK0103,130,...Boss!
SK0103,131,Wah! You surprised me, Kanna! Is there something else you needed?
SK0103,132,Oh, my bad, sorry. I forgot to tell you something important.
SK0103,133,I was gonna give you my Call Number.
SK0103,134,Let's see, my number is... Aha, there it is, "14000"!
SK0103,135,It's 14000, right? OK, I'll set it to my Speed Dial.
SK0103,136,Bye, Boss! Sleep well tonight!
SK0103,137,OK, it's getting pretty late already, so I should just end the call.
SK0103,138,Now, what should I do next?
SK0103,139,...Hm? At this hour? Who could that be?
SK0103,140,Yes? I'm coming!
SK0103,141,Good evening, Ogami.
SK0103,142,Good evening, Sakura. What is it?
SK0103,143,The manager was wondering if you could do the night watch.
SK0103,144,Night watch will only be until 10 o'clock. You can inspect the theater in 30 minutes.
SK0103,145,Night patrol, huh...
SK0103,146,I'll join you, Ogami. Let's go together.
SK0103,147,I know! Let's ask Orihime to come along too. This will be a great chance to talk with her.
SK0103,148,OK, let's go.
SK0103,149,...Orihime?
SK0103,150,I just want to go to sleep...
SK0103,151,OK, let's go. It'll be my first job as the captain, so I should do my best.
SK0103,152,I'm concerned about Orihime, too.
SK0103,153,I'm relieved that you accepted like that. Thank you so much!
SK0103,154,Let's head to Orihime's room, then.
SK0103,155,Talk with her? Wouldn't that just create more trouble between us?
SK0103,156,Ogami, solving problems among your peers is one of your duties as captain!
SK0103,157,Now let's head to her room. Follow me.
SK0103,158,I-I get it. We're going, we're going.
SK0103,159,Actually, I just want to head to bed. A Lot of things have happened today, and I'm exhausted.
SK0103,160,I see, and here I am certain you would have accepted.
SK0103,161,Sorry for disturbing you. Well, good night.
SK0103,162,...
SK0103,163,Guess I might have overdone it.
SK0103,164,Oh well, can't help it. I'll just hit the hay, then.
SK0103,165,Ogami, if you keep hesitating it'll be midnight. 
SK0103,166,Let's just talk to her before she goes to sleep.
SK0103,167,Hmmm... What should we do?
SK0103,168,All right, I'm just gonna drag you over there by force.
SK0103,169,H-Hey, Sakura! Don't pull my sleeve! W-Wait!
SK0103,170,So, this is Orihime's room. I wonder if she's still awake.
SK0103,171,Ogami! Where do you think you're going? You need to talk to her!
SK0103,172,The name plate has a simple design, but it sure looks classy.
SK0103,173,Yeees? Who is it?
SK0103,174,It's Ogami. Could I talk to you for a moment?
SK0103,175,Ensign? It's late. What do you need, is it urgent?
SK0103,176,Orihime, it's Sakura. Sorry for disturbing you so late at night. 
SK0103,177,Um, there's something we wanted to talk with you about.
SK0103,178,...
SK0103,179,I don't know what you want, but I'm about to go to sleep. Make it snappy, OK?
SK0103,180,If it takes too long, I might just leave in the middle of it.
SK0103,181,(Looks like she's not in a great mood. Let's try to invite her along on our night watch.)
SK0103,182,(I need to be careful with this, or else she might leave in the middle of our chat. All right. let's do this.)
SK0103,183,Where do you think you're looking at?! You just called me out here; your rudeness knows no bounds!
SK0103,184,Uh... N-No. You're mistaken.
SK0103,185,Ogami, just where did you look at? We need to invite her for the night patrol.
SK0103,186,Y-Yeah, you're right.
SK0103,187,...
SK0103,188,(Orihime... She's glaring at me.)
SK0103,189,Avert her eyes.
SK0103,190,O-Orihime... Don't stare at me like that, please.
SK0103,191,Hehe. So you're averting my gaze, just as I expected.
SK0103,192,Avoiding eye contact shows a lack of self-confidence.
SK0103,193,Is that all you got, Ensign?
SK0103,194,Urk...
SK0103,195,...
SK0103,196,Hehe, so you're not averting my gaze, huh.
SK0103,197,Avoiding eye contact shows a lack of self-confidence.
SK0103,198,Not that I'm implying that you do have it.
SK0103,199,Well? What do you want to talk about?
SK0103,200,Wow, Orihime, I didn't think Italians like you could have such pretty black hair.
SK0103,201,...That's none of your business! Back off!
SK0103,202,Yikes! D-Did I say something to make her mad?
SK0103,203,(She'll just get angry if I bring up her hair. Let's just leave it.)
SK0103,204,I always wear a negligee to bed.
SK0103,205,Sakura, why don't you try to wear one sometime?
SK0103,206,That'd be sexy!
SK0103,207,I'm sure it would suit her.
SK0103,208,That'd be too adult for her.
SK0103,209,If you wear it, Sakura, I'm sure you'd look sexy in it!
SK0103,210,Ogami, come on... Don't tease me like that.
SK0103,211,If you wear it, Sakura, I'm sure it'd suit you just fine.
SK0103,212,Do you think so? Wouldn't this look a little too mature for me?
SK0103,213,No, of course not.
SK0103,214,Ogami... Thank you.
SK0103,215,If you two want to flirt, do it somewhere else, would you?
SK0103,216,A negligee, huh? I think that'd be too much for Sakura.
SK0103,217,You still think I'm immature, don't you?
SK0103,218,If you two want to squabble, do it somewhere else, would you?
SK0103,219,...I-I think that's a bit too mature for me.
SK0103,220,Oho... Well, perhaps you're right.
SK0103,221,So, what did you want to talk about? I'm sure you didn't come here just to see me in my negligee, right?
SK0103,222,Hey, Ensign! Where were you staring at just now?!
SK0103,223,N-No, that's... I-I didn't do it on purpose.
SK0103,224,So you came here just to ogle other peoples' bodies? Goodness!
SK0103,225,(I'll be in serious trouble if I stare again.)
SK0103,226,These are my favorite earrings.
SK0103,227,I only take them off before going to sleep.
SK0103,228,(Those pretty earrings suit her well.)
SK0103,229,Seriously, what were you going to talk to me about?
SK0103,230,(How should I start?)
SK0103,231,Invite her directly
SK0103,232,Beat around the bush
SK0103,233,I'll get straight to the point. Would you like to come with us on night watch?
SK0103,234,Night watch? What's that?
SK0103,235,How do evenings in Japan feel compared to Italy? Is it warmer here, or colder? 
SK0103,236,...Did you call me out here just to talk about that?
SK0103,237,W-Wait, Orihime! Actually, we wanted to invite you along on our night watch.
SK0103,238,Night watch...?
SK0103,239,If you don't have any business with me, I shall be taking my leave.
SK0103,240,W-Wait, Orihime! Actually, we wanted to invite you along on our night watch.
SK0103,241,Night watch...?
SK0103,242,We go around the theater to check anything out of the ordinary.
SK0103,243,Would you like to join us? Because...
SK0103,244,You're bored right now.
SK0103,245,It would be a good change of pace.
SK0103,246,...You're bored right now?
SK0103,247,Just because I'm bored, that doesn't mean I have to join you, though.
SK0103,248,...It'll be a good change of pace. Perfect for killing boredom, right?
SK0103,249,Hm... I wonder about that.
SK0103,250,Um... I think it'll be a good change of pace.
SK0103,251,Change of pace, huh... I wonder about that.
SK0103,252,Well, I do want to take a look at the music room.
SK0103,253,How long will you be doing the night watch?
SK0103,254,Until 10 o'clock.
SK0103,255,Until 11 o'clock.
SK0103,256,Until 12 o'clock.
SK0103,257,Until 10 o'clock.
SK0103,258,10 o'clock, huh... I suppose I could spare the time.
SK0103,259,Until 11 o'clock.
SK0103,260,You got it wrong, Ogami! I told you already, it's until 10 o'clock. 10 o'clock.
SK0103,261,So, how long? Just tell me already!
SK0103,262,Until 12 o'clock.
SK0103,263,You got it wrong, Ogami! I told you already, it's until 10 o'clock. 10 o'clock.
SK0103,264,So, how long? Just tell me already!
SK0103,265,Ogami, did you forget? We're going to do it until 10 o'clock.
SK0103,266,10 o'clock, huh... I suppose I could spare the time.
SK0103,267,But still, why did you want to invite me?
SK0103,268,I wanted to talk with you more.
SK0103,269,I wanted to show you around the theater.
SK0103,270,I wanted to talk with you some more. We haven't had the chance to since this afternoon.
SK0103,271,...What kind of reason is that?
SK0103,272,I have nothing to talk with you about.
SK0103,273,I wanted to show you around the theater. Maybe there will be some other things that'd pique your interest like the tatami mats.
SK0103,274,Good idea. I guess I'll join you, then.
SK0103,275,Reason? Um... How should I put it...
SK0103,276,Is there something you're not telling me? How suspicious.
SK0103,277,Come on, Orihime, let's go. Is there a problem?
SK0103,278,Let me get this straight. I do not want to go with the ensign.
SK0103,279,Don't say that. Let's go.
SK0103,280,I didn't mean to be pushy about it.
SK0103,281,Don't say that, Orihime. Let's go, now.
SK0103,282,You know what, forget it. I'm not going to listen to what some Japanese man tells me to do.
SK0103,283,I shall be taking my leave now. Good luck with your night watch, you two.
SK0103,284,Ugh... That could have gone better.
SK0103,285,That's too bad. And it would have been a good chance to talk with her, too.
SK0103,286,Well, there'll be more chances to talk with her. Let's just continue with the two of us.
SK0103,287,You're right, let's go.
SK0103,288,I didn't mean to be pushy about this. Night watch can be rather difficult, after all.
SK0103,289,...I resent that.
SK0103,290,All right, if you say so. I'll go with you this time.
SK0103,291,Really? Thank goodness!
SK0103,292,Way to go, Ogami. You managed to persuade Orihime even though she was so harsh on you.
SK0103,293,What are you two whispering about?
SK0103,294,N-Nothing! It's nothing! Don't worry about it.
SK0103,295,A-Anyway, let's go out on night patrol!
SK0103,296,Orihime... Why do you hate Japanese men so much?
SK0103,297,That's none of your business! I'm not going to answer that!
SK0103,298,I shall be taking my leave now. Good luck with your night watch, you two.
SK0103,299,Ugh... That could have gone better.
SK0103,300,Did I just... say something that I shouldn't have?
SK0103,301,No, I don't think so. I guess it's just that she can be hard to approach.
SK0103,302,Well, there'll be more chances to talk with her. Let's just continue with the two of us.
SK0103,303,You're right, let's go.
SK0103,304,All right, if you say so. I'll go with you this time.
SK0103,305,But mind you, only for this one time, OK? 
SK0103,306,Really? Thank goodness!
SK0103,307,Way to go, Ogami! You even managed to persuade Orihime.
SK0103,308,What are you two whispering about?
SK0103,309,N-Nothing! It's nothing! Don't worry about it.
SK0103,310,A-Anyway, let's go out on night patrol!
SK0103,311,You know what, forget it. Even after all this chatting, I still don't feel like going with you.
SK0103,312,I shall be taking my leave now. Good luck with your night watch, you two.
SK0103,313,Ugh... That's not good. I should have just gotten straight to the point with her.
SK0103,314,That's too bad. And it would have been a good chance to talk with her, too.
SK0103,315,Well, there'll be more chances to talk with her. Let's just continue with the two of us.
SK0103,316,You're right, let's go.
SK0103,317,Ah! Mon Frère, Sakura...
SK0103,318,And Orihime, too...
SK0103,319,Iris...
SK0103,320,What are you doing up at this hour?
SK0103,321,No staying up late.
SK0103,322,Iris, what are you doing up at this hour?
SK0103,323,I wanted to go on night watch, too, so I was looking for you.
SK0103,324,Iris, no staying up late, OK?
SK0103,325,You guys are no fair! You get to go on night watch all by the time!
SK0103,326,I was looking for you. I want to go on night watch, too.
SK0103,327,What are you doing up so late?
SK0103,328,What are you doing up so late?
SK0103,329,I was looking for you. I want to go on night watch, too.
SK0103,330,Is that so? Sorry, Iris, but...
SK0103,331,It's already this late for you. Go back to your room and sleep for today, OK?
SK0103,332,OK, I'll go to sleep, but...
SK0103,333,Oh, I know! I'll go to sleep after you find me in hide-and-seek.
SK0103,334,This time, it's your turn to seek.
SK0103,335,OK, I'm going to hide in costume room. You better come for me!
SK0103,336,Oho, looks like Iris has got you wrapped around her little finger, Ensign.
SK0103,337,Looks like Iris got you, Ogami.
SK0103,338,There's no helping it. I'll just play along with her.
SK0103,339,Now... Where would Iris be hiding?
SK0103,340,There's a shadow right here. Could it be Iris?
SK0103,341,Whaaat? You found me already?
SK0103,342,I really thought there'd be no way I'd get caught. How did know?
SK0103,343,I can see your shadow on the floor.
SK0103,344,You would be more difficult to see if you turned off the light, beforehand.
SK0103,345,Could it be that she's... hiding among the costumes?
SK0103,346,It's quite hard to tell from here, isn't it?
SK0103,347,It's quite hard to tell from here...
SK0103,348,Hmmm... It's hard to figure out since there's so many. 
SK0103,349,Don't tell me, she's inside this box...
SK0103,350,O-Ogami, I know that Iris is small, but even she wouldn't be able fit in that box.
SK0103,351,She's not in there, Ogami.
SK0103,352,Let me guess, she's inside... this shoe.
SK0103,353,Ensign, are you out of your mind?
SK0103,354,Seriously, Ogami?
SK0103,355,Ensign, are you looking for a fairy or something?
SK0103,356,I get that she's small, but there's no way she would be able fit inside that shoe.
SK0103,357,The shadow next to the shelf looks suspicious.
SK0103,358,We looked there earlier and didn't find her.
SK0103,359,If she's not here, where could she be hiding?
SK0103,360,Make sure to return used costumes to their original place."
SK0103,361,Everyone makes sure to follow the rules. Thanks to that, this room is always clean and tidy.
SK0103,362,Wash hands before handling costumes."
SK0103,363,Did you wash your hands with soap, Ensign?
SK0103,364,Be careful not to dirty the costumes.
SK0103,365,What a big mirror... I can see my whole body.
SK0103,366,Admiring yourself in the mirror like that, even though you're a man, talk about gross.
SK0103,367,Don't just look at the mirror, Ogami. We need to find Iris.
SK0103,368,Ogami, let's keep looking for Iris like you promised her.
SK0103,369,Time's up, Mon Frère!
SK0103,370,Ah, Ogami! There's a shadow on the floor close to the costumes!
SK0103,371,I see... So that's where she's hiding, behind the costumes.
SK0103,372,Ehehe! Too late now!
SK0103,373,You didn't find me in time, so I win!
SK0103,374,Oh... You got me.
SK0103,375,Ah, this is fun! Playing hide-and-seek at night like this gets me so excited.
SK0103,376,Hehe... Good for you, Iris.
SK0103,377,It's getting late, so please go back to your room now.
SK0103,378,Okaaay! Well, good niiight!
SK0103,379,I see you have a hard time handling kids, too, Ensign
SK0103,380,Well, Iris a member of the Flower Division.
SK0103,381,We've already spent a lot of time here. Let's get back to our night watch.
SK0103,382,That was great, Ogami. Seems that cheered up Iris a lot.
SK0103,383,I didn't expect her to want me to play hide-and-seek with her.
SK0103,384,We've already spent a lot of time here. Let's get back to our night watch.
SK0103,385,Looks like there's nothing out of the ordinary. Let's head to the next room.
SK0103,386,This is the music room, we just added it recently.
SK0103,387,There's a piano. I wonder if we know anyone who can play it.
SK0103,388,Iris is very good with it. I'm still learning how to play it, so I've got a ways to go.
SK0103,389,I believe Orihime can play the piano as well.
SK0103,390,If Orihime is ever with us, maybe she can play a song for us.
SK0103,391,OK, let's move on. We need to check the other rooms.
SK0103,392,This is the music room, we just added it recently.
SK0103,393,Wow, there's a piano right there!
SK0103,394,May I play it for a bit?
SK0103,395,Yes, go ahead.
SK0103,396,Ohoho. Well then, I'm gonna play my heart out!
SK0103,397,...
SK0103,398,(Orihime looks serious...)
SK0103,399,OK... Here I go!
SK0103,400,Wow, amazing! That was really great, Orihime!
SK0103,401,Oho, grazie mille!
SK0103,402,You're very talented, Orihime. Just as I expected.
SK0103,403,Hmmm, so you understand music, huh, Ensign?
SK0103,404,Then that must mean you know what the name of that song I just played was.
SK0103,405,Was it "German March"?
SK0103,406,Was it "Italian March"?
SK0103,407,Was it "Turkish March"?
SK0103,408,I think it's called... "German March"?
SK0103,409,Wrooong! I knew you wouldn't have known.
SK0103,410,I was playing Mozart's "Turkish March."
SK0103,411,O-Oh... Is that so.
SK0103,412,I think it's called... "Italian March"?
SK0103,413,Wrooong! I knew you wouldn't have known.
SK0103,414,I was playing Mozart's "Turkish March."
SK0103,415,O-Oh... Is that so.
SK0103,416,I think it's called... "Turkish March"?
SK0103,417,Oh... I didn't expect that you would know that much about music.
SK0103,418,I don't really remember that song's name, but I think that your piano playing was great.
SK0103,419,Ohoho, I knew you wouldn't know.
SK0103,420,Still, I'm impressed that you didn't pretend to know everything.
SK0103,421,I was playing Mozart's "Turkish March."
SK0103,422,It's common knowledge. Make sure to remember that, Ensign.
SK0103,423,...
SK0103,424,Boy, Orihime, your face was so different when you were playing that song.
SK0103,425,You looked very serious. I can tell that you really like music.
SK0103,426,I-It's not like that!
SK0103,427,Let's just continue your night patrol, Ensign!
SK0103,428,Y-Yeah, right. Let's head to the next room.
SK0103,429,Everything seems to be in order. Let's check the next room.
SK0103,430,This is the costume room. All of our play costumes are stored in here.
SK0103,431,This is where we played hide-and-seek with Iris, isn't it?
SK0103,432,Well, with all these costumes hanging around, there's certainly plenty of places to hide.
SK0103,433,Looks like everything is in order, let's move on.
SK0103,434,This is the costume room. All of our play costumes are stored in here.
SK0103,435,This is where we were playing hide-and-seek with Iris in this room too, isn't it?
SK0103,436,She should've hid in a better spot.
SK0103,437,Seems like there's nothing strange going on in here. Let's check another room.
SK0103,438,This is the dressing room where we held that welcome party.
SK0103,439,You guys organized that party just for us. Thank you. It really made me happy.
SK0103,440,Too bad that Orihime didn't seem to like it very much...
SK0103,441,Yeah, that was too bad. In time though, I think she'll appreciate what we did.
SK0103,442,How about we go on to the next room? There's still plenty of rooms we haven't checked.
SK0103,443,This is the dressing room where we held that welcome party.
SK0103,444,Orihime, can I ask why you were in such a bad mood earlier?
SK0103,445,...I don't want to talk to you about it, Ensign.
SK0103,446,Nothing strange here. Let's head to the next room, shall we?
SK0103,447,There's nothing strange in here, let's head to another room.
SK0103,448,This is the stage wing. This is where the actors wait before going up on stage.
SK0103,449,I wonder why they call it a "wing."
SK0103,450,...Oh well, there's no need to think too much about it. Let's go somewhere else.
SK0103,451,This is the stage wing. This is where the actors wait before going up on stage.
SK0103,452,Wing"? That's a weird way to say it.
SK0103,453,Hahaha, yeah, no idea why it's called that.
SK0103,454,Well, nothing strange here. Let's go on to the next room.
SK0103,455,Doesn't look like anyone is behind the backdrop. Looks like everything is as it should be. 
SK0103,456,This is the Prop Room. We store props and settings for our performances in here.
SK0103,457,I see. Looks like there's some interesting stuff in here.
SK0103,458,I'd like to take the time to look around, but we're still on patrol. Maybe some other time.
SK0103,459,From what I can tell, this looks like the prop room.
SK0103,460,Yes, that's right. We store prop and settings for our performances in here.
SK0103,461,Looks like everything's organized. Even a rat wouldn't be able to hide in here.
SK0103,462,(I hope Orihime won't make another fuss at tomorrow's rehearsal.)
SK0103,463,Ogami? You've been a bit silent, is something wrong?
SK0103,464,N-No, everything's fine. How about we head to the next room?
SK0103,465,So this is the Stage, huh? The Flower Division always holds their performances in this place, right?
SK0103,466,It just got renovated. Before, some of the sets had collapsed.
SK0103,467,Oh, I know! We're going to rehearse here tomorrow.
SK0103,468,I'll try to invite Orihime.
SK0103,469,I see, nice idea.
SK0103,470,Do you think that's a good idea?
SK0103,471,It's better not to ask.
SK0103,472,That's a nice idea. I'm sure she'll accept.
SK0103,473,Yes. I think it'll be a good chance to get to know her better.
SK0103,474,Are you sure that's a good idea? I don't know if she'll accept right away.
SK0103,475,It'll be fine! Orihime is a stage actress, just like us.
SK0103,476,I'm sure she'll join us.
SK0103,477,I don't think we should. She'll just make a scene like she did earlier today.
SK0103,478,Ogami, if you keep talking like that, Orihime will never open up, no matter how much time passes.
SK0103,479,R-Right...
SK0103,480,I think it'll be a good chance to get to know her better. I'll ask her tomorrow.
SK0103,481,Ah, I'm sorry for talking so much... We're still in the middle of patrolling.
SK0103,482,...Now let's get back to our night watch.
SK0103,483,So this is the Stage, huh? The Flower Division always holds their performances in this place, right?
SK0103,484,It just got renovated. Before, some of the sets had collapsed.
SK0103,485,I know! Orihime, we're going to rehearse in here soon.
SK0103,486,Would you like to join us?
SK0103,487,Rehearsal?
SK0103,488,I'm not really up for it, but I'll join you anyway.
SK0103,489,I want to see how skilled you all are at acting.
SK0103,490,O-OK. We're looking forward to it.
SK0103,491,Good luck tomorrow, you two.
SK0103,492,Let's continue our patrol, then.
SK0103,493,Zzzzzzzz... Zzzzzzzz...
SK0103,494,Sounds like Mr. Yoneda is asleep. Guess we'll just head to another room.
SK0103,495,This is the Manager's Office. I wonder if he's still here.
SK0103,496,Zzzzzzzz... Zzzzzzzz...
SK0103,497,Sounds like he's asleep.
SK0103,498,Mamma mia, that's a loud snore.
SK0103,499,Hehe, it really is, now that you mention it.
SK0103,500,It'd be bad if we wake him up, so we'll just leave him be. Let's check another room.
SK0103,501,This is the Secretarial Office.  I filled out my arrival form in here earlier this afternoon.
SK0103,502,Seems like Kasumi and Yuri already went home.
SK0103,503,You sometimes help them sort their receipts in here, right, Ogami?
SK0103,504,Oh, jeez... Japanese men do so much work whether it's day or night, just like ants.
SK0103,505,Hahaha... Sorting the receipts is an important job, just like patrolling the theater.
SK0103,506,OK, doors are locked and nothing's out of place. Let's get going.
SK0103,507,Nothing strange in the Secretarial Office. Let's continue our patrol.
SK0103,508,This is the Visitor's Entrance. We welcome our special guests here.
SK0103,509,Let's check the door... Yep, it's locked tight.
SK0103,510,There's nothing odd in here. Let's get going, then.
SK0103,511,This is the Visitor's Entrance. We welcome our special guests here.
SK0103,512,Let's check the door... Yep, it's locked tight.
SK0103,513,So you have to check the locks yourself? Does this theater have a shortage of workers or something?
SK0103,514,This is part of the captain's duty.
SK0103,515,You think so?
SK0103,516,This is a part of the captain's duty. It's an important task in order to protect this theater.
SK0103,517,Ogami...
SK0103,518,Hmmm... That sounds plausible.
SK0103,519,Let's continue our patrol. Which room should we check after this?
SK0103,520,You think so too? And just after I returned here, too.
SK0103,521,Ogami, aren't you being a bit selfish right now?
SK0103,522,Seems like it was worth witnessing the true feelings of a Japanese man, however.
SK0103,523,What I need to do is just keep silent, and focus on doing my job right.
SK0103,524,OK, nothing's out of place. Let's continue our night patrol.
SK0103,525,Yes!
SK0103,526,Uh-huh...
SK0103,527,The doors have been locked. OK, let's check the next room.
SK0103,528,The doors have been locked. OK, let's check the next room.
SK0103,529,This is the Kitchen. Earlier, we made food for the welcoming party here.
SK0103,530,Let's check if the gas has been turned off. We don't want this theater to catch fire.
SK0103,531,OK, all good. The locks are working, too. Let's get going.
SK0103,532,This is the Kitchen. Earlier, we made food for the welcoming party here.
SK0103,533,The welcoming party was rather awful, but the food was delicious!
SK0103,534,Yeah, it was delicious.
SK0103,535,Is that so? I'm glad to hear that.
SK0103,536,OK, the gas is off, let's get going.
SK0103,537,OK, the gas is off, let's head to the next room.
SK0103,538,The Dining Hall has been renovated, so now it gives a different atmosphere.
SK0103,539,It feels rather quiet at night, don't you think?
SK0103,540,It does feel like that compared to how lively it usually is in the afternoon. 
SK0103,541,Looks like there's nothing out of place, so let's get going.
SK0103,542,The Dining Hall has been renovated, so now it gives off a different atmosphere.
SK0103,543,So this is the Dining Hall? It seems rather cramped to me.
SK0103,544,Is that so? I think it's spacious enough already.
SK0103,545,Perhaps you think that because you come from a noble family.
SK0103,546,I can't help it. Now then, how about we get going?
SK0103,547,No one's around, let's check another room.
SK0103,548,The animals that have been hibernating are definitely going to wake up this season.
SK0103,549,Meanwhile, I'd get in trouble just for wanting to stay in bed a little longer than usual.
SK0103,550,Hahaha, you're right. It's tough to get out of bed when it's Spring.
SK0103,551,Let's get going. We can still catch a cold even if the weather's gotten warmer.
SK0103,552,No one's around. Makes sense, since it's already this late.
SK0103,553,Nothing odd in here. Let's get going.
SK0103,554,Is it that necessary to check outside here?
SK0103,555,No one's around. Let's get back inside and lock the door.
SK0103,556,Starting this year, the Flower Division will hold four different seasonal performances.
SK0103,557,This June, we'll be putting on "King Lear" for our summer performance.
SK0103,558,I'm looking forward to the play.
SK0103,559,Yes! Please do.
SK0103,560,Starting this year, the Flower Division will hold four different seasonal performances.
SK0103,561,This June, we'll be putting on "King Lear" for our summer performance.
SK0103,562,I'm looking forward to the play, it's a great story.
SK0103,563,Sounds like you already know quite a bit about "King Lear", Ensign. Surely you must know who wrote it, right?
SK0103,564,Dostoyevsky?
SK0103,565,Shakespeare?
SK0103,566,Mozart?
SK0103,567,It was... Dostoyevsky, wasn't it?
SK0103,568,Dostoyevsky was a Russian novelist. You got it completely wrong!
SK0103,569,King Lear" was written by Shakespeare. Isn't that common knowledge?
SK0103,570,O-Oh... Is that so.
SK0103,571,I'm tired of talking with such uncultured people, let's get back to your patrol.
SK0103,572,It was... Shakespeare, wasn't it?
SK0103,573,Huh, so you do know it, Ensign.
SK0103,574,But I doubt if you know the full plot.
SK0103,575,L-Let's put this topic aside and get back to our patrol.
SK0103,576,It was... Mozart, wasn't it?
SK0103,577,Mozart?! Seriously, are you joking or what?
SK0103,578,It was Shakespeare who wrote "King Lear." He was a playwright,
SK0103,579,while Mozart was a composer. Each of them are from a completely different field, you know.
SK0103,580,O-Oh... Is that so.
SK0103,581,If you want to act like a know-it-all, I suggest you to do it better.
SK0103,582,L-Let's put this topic aside and get back to our patrol.
SK0103,583,I... don't know who wrote it.
SK0103,584,But seriously, I'm looking forward to your performance of "King Lear."
SK0103,585,Uh-huh... That's better that acting like you know it all.
SK0103,586,Anyway, it was Shakespeare who wrote it. It's common knowledge, you know.
SK0103,587,Guys, let's put this topic aside and get back to our patrol.
SK0103,588,Looks like everything is in order. Let's go check another room.
SK0103,589,The Lobby sure is quiet now. It's usually crowded with people.
SK0103,590,Looks like everything is in order. Let's go check another room.
SK0103,591,The Lobby sure is quiet now. It's usually crowded with people.
SK0103,592,There's no point in staying here.
SK0103,593,Yeah. Let's check another room.
SK0103,594,Looks like everything is in order. Let's go check another room.
SK0103,595,Tsubaki sells photos at this gift shop during the day.
SK0103,596,Right, I already bought one. And it's your photo, Sakura.
SK0103,597,Huh?! For real?
SK0103,598,Here, take a look.
SK0103,599,It is... Oh, now I'm all embarrassed.
SK0103,600,But at the same time, it makes me quite happy see that, too.
SK0103,601,What are you two doing, wasting time like this? You need to get back to doing your rounds.
SK0103,602,Ah... I-I'm sorry.
SK0103,603,And you, Ensign, Quit flaunting that stuff around.
SK0103,604,You Japanese men are so blatantly shallow!
SK0103,605,S-Sorry.
SK0103,606,L-Let's continue patrolling.
SK0103,607,OK, let's continue patrolling.
SK0103,608,All right.
SK0103,609,I see. I'll drop by here next chance I get.
SK0103,610,I wanted to buy a photo, but Tsubaki's not around. I'll have to visit again tomorrow afternoon.
SK0103,611,This is the entrance hall. It's the theater's main entrance.
SK0103,612,Let's check the door... Yep, it's locked tight.
SK0103,613,There's nothing odd in here. Let's get going, then.
SK0103,614,This is the entrance hall. It's the theater's main entrance.
SK0103,615,Let's check the door... Yep, it's locked tight.
SK0103,616,So you have to check the locks yourself? Does this theater have a shortage of workers or something?
SK0103,617,This is a part of being the captain.
SK0103,618,You think so?
SK0103,619,This is a part of being the captain. It's important to protect this theater.
SK0103,620,Ogami...
SK0103,621,Hmmm... That sounds plausible.
SK0103,622,Let's continue our patrol. Which room should we check after this?
SK0103,623,You think so too? And just after I returned here, too.
SK0103,624,Ogami, you're being selfish!
SK0103,625,Seems like it was worth witnessing the true feelings of a Japanese man, however.
SK0103,626,What I need to do is just keep silent, and focus on doing my job right.
SK0103,627,OK, everything's good here. Let's continue patrolling.
SK0103,628,Yes!
SK0103,629,Uh-huh...
SK0103,630,The doors have been locked. OK, let's check the next room.
SK0103,631,The doors have been locked. OK, let's check the next room.
SK0103,632,Ogami, the Basement is undergoing renovations right now, so access is restricted.
SK0103,633,Renovations, huh?  I wonder what they're working on down there.
SK0103,634,The workers are redoing the Swimming Pool and the Infirmary. The shower room is being converted into a Japanese-style bath house, too.
SK0103,635,Nothing can beat a bath house.
SK0103,636,Bath house, eh?
SK0103,637,Nothing can beat a good old bath house.
SK0103,638,I hope it'll be mixed gender...
SK0103,639,Nothing can beat a Japanese bath house. Sink your body into a large tub and all the day's troubles just seems to melt away.
SK0103,640,Agreed, I can't wait to see it when they're finished.
SK0103,641,...Japanese bath house? Don't tell me it's another thing made out of grass.
SK0103,642,Don't worry. I'm positive that you'll like it.
SK0103,643,Anyway, please keep in mind that the Basement is a restricted area for now.
SK0103,644,Bath house, eh?
SK0103,645,Ogami, are you having lewd thoughts?
SK0103,646,N-No, I-I'm just thinking about what the finished product will look like.
SK0103,647,Your face tells me otherwise.
SK0103,648,Y-You're just being paranoid! L-Let's just continue our patrol!
SK0103,649,I hope it'll be mixed gender...
SK0103,650,Ogami, you shouldn't say things like that out loud!
SK0103,651,So this is the real you, huh?! Just as I thought, Japanese men are deceptive and shallow!
SK0103,652,I-I'm kidding! Just kidding! Don't take it so seriously!
SK0103,653,Well, you sounded like you were serious about it.
SK0103,654,Anyways, Ogami, the Basement is a restricted area for now. Get it?
SK0103,655,Y-Yeah. Got it.
SK0103,656,OK then, let's get back to doing the night watch..
SK0103,657,Ogami, I already said that the Basement access is restricted for now.
SK0103,658,Ah... R-Right. I totally forgot about that.
SK0103,659,You're not pretending to forget, are you?
SK0103,660,L-Let's get back to patrol! Where should we head next?
SK0103,661,This is the Library. It has quite a lot of books.
SK0103,662,Mr. Yoneda told me that some of Japan's rarest books are kept here, too. 
SK0103,663,Interesting. I'll try to read a few next time.
SK0103,664,This is the Library. It has quite a lot of books.
SK0103,665,Ohhhh. So you do have this kind of space.
SK0103,666,Mr. Yoneda told me that some of Japan's rarest books are kept here, too. 
SK0103,667,Interesting. I'll try to read a few next time.
SK0103,668,How about you reading Shakespeare as well, Ensign?
SK0103,669,Everything's fine in here, let's continue patroling.
SK0103,670,Ayame... This used to be her room.
SK0103,671,Right, Ayame... She's not with us anymore.
SK0103,672,Even so, we'll never forget about her.
SK0103,673,We'll always remember that smile she had.
SK0103,674,Ayame... This used to be her room.
SK0103,675,Ayame? Who's that?
SK0103,676,She used to be the Deputy Commander of the Imperial Assault Troupe.
SK0103,677,Right, Ayame... She's not with us anymore.
SK0103,678,Even so, we'll never forget about her.
SK0103,679,We'll always remember that smile she had.
SK0103,680,This room is still empty. There's no need to check it out, then.
SK0103,681,Ogami, we're in the middle of night watch.
SK0103,682,We need to keep inspecting the theater until 10 o'clock.
SK0103,683,S-Sorry.
SK0103,684,Ogami, we're in the middle of night watch.
SK0103,685,We need to keep inspecting the theater until 10 o'clock.
SK0103,686,So, were you planning to go back to your own room?
SK0103,687,S-Sorry.
SK0103,688,Ogami, remember, we're still on patrol.
SK0103,689,This is the game room. It recently got added to the theater.
SK0103,690,There's a lot of stuff in here. It all looks like fun.
SK0103,691,Well, Iris and I haven't actually used this room yet.
SK0103,692,Let's get going. There are still some rooms we need to inspect.
SK0103,693,This is the game room. It recently got added to the theater.
SK0103,694,There's a lot of stuff in here. It all looks like fun.
SK0103,695,I don't think we have much time to spend in here. Let's get going.
SK0103,696,I did want to play in the game room for a bit, but we're still in the middle of patrol. Let's hold off for now.
SK0103,697,Ooh, this room is quite stylish.
SK0103,698,This is the salon. We just redecorated with new furniture and other decorations in here.
SK0103,699,Sumire gave out lots of orders when we were working.
SK0103,700,Hahaha, that certainly sounds like her.
SK0103,701,It's definitely because this is her favorite place to spend time in.
SK0103,702,OK, we better get going. Everything's in order.
SK0103,703,Nobody's here. Let's continue our patrol.
SK0103,704,This is second floor seating.
SK0103,705,The first floor is for general seats, while the second floor is seating for VIPs.
SK0103,706,There's no doubt that these seats will sell out when I'm on stage.
SK0103,707,Hahaha, OK.
SK0103,708,Well, looks like everything's fine in here. Let's check another room.
SK0103,709,Looks like everything's in order here. Let's check another room.
SK0103,710,...Huh? Where'd Sakura go?
SK0103,711,Oh, there you are, Sakura.
SK0103,712,Ogami, come here. Look outside.
SK0103,713,Oh, wow. Ginza at night...
SK0103,714,Two years ago, when I just arrived in Tokyo, I didn't know anything about the city.
SK0103,715,This view was the first thing I fell in love with here.
SK0103,716,Since then I... I wanted to be as bright as the street lights down there.
SK0103,717,I wanted my performances to be as beautiful as the street lights that shine with the other lights of the city.
SK0103,718,I swore to be a beacon of strength and warmth to the capital, just like how they guide people to their destination. 
SK0103,719,I want to be that kind of light. Even now, that's what I strive to become.
SK0103,720,Orihime may seem pretty hostile, but I understand her feelings.
SK0103,721,She must be feeling the same way I did back then.
SK0103,722,Nervous about being in a new place, but unable to come out and say it...
SK0103,723,But I believe that someday Orihime will see these lights with us...
SK0103,724,And she'll appreciate their beauty like we do.
SK0103,725,Sakura...
SK0103,726,Sorry... I ended up talking too much. We're still in the middle of our patrol.
SK0103,727,Now then, let's get going.
SK0103,728,This is the hall. Take the stairway down, and we'll reach the lobby on the first floor.
SK0103,729,Iris likes to slide down the banister, even though I told her it's dangerous.
SK0103,730,Look's like no one's here, so how about we get going?
SK0103,731,You're right. Let's check another room.
SK0103,732,No one's here. Let's continue our patrol.
SK0103,733,Orihime, look, you can see Ginza's nightscape from here and the street lamps. 
SK0103,734,Are those tiny lights down there supposed to be special?
SK0103,735,...
SK0103,736,Someday you'll understand the beauty of those lights. I'm sure of it.
SK0103,737,...Now let's get back to our night watch.
SK0103,738,Looks like everything's in order, so let's get going.
SK0103,739,We're at... What room is this?
SK0103,740,This room is empty, no one is using it.
SK0103,741,The door's locked so we can't get inside. It seems OK, though.
SK0103,742,Jeez... You must be daft to think that we should check on an empty room. 
SK0103,743,This room is empty, Ogami.
SK0103,744,Is that so? Well, we better check another room.
SK0103,745,This is my room. We're still in the middle of patrol, so let's check somewhere else.
SK0103,746,This is my room.
SK0103,747,You're thinking of entering that room, aren't you, Ensign?
SK0103,748,Just for inspection.
SK0103,749,H-How did you know?!
SK0103,750,Just for inspection. I have no intentions other than that.
SK0103,751,Is that so? A convenient excuse.
SK0103,752,Never mind that, there's nothing's strange in there. Let's just continue with our patrol.
SK0103,753,H-How did you know?!
SK0103,754,You're a Japanese man, I figured you were up to no good.
SK0103,755,It seems like I hit the nail on the head.
SK0103,756,Ogami, did you really come here for that reason?
SK0103,757,Ah, no, that's...
SK0103,758,Let's go. We're not done yet.
SK0103,759,Oooh, she's angry at you, Ensign. Well, you reap what you sow.
SK0103,760,Are you ignoring me?! Now that gets me angry!
SK0103,761,Now, now, Orihime. It's because you asked him something so unexpected.
SK0103,762,Let's get going, OK? There's still some rooms we need to check.
SK0103,763,I don't think there's anything wrong with my room. Let's go somewhere else.
SK0103,764,This is Kanna's room. Right now she's back home in Okinawa.
SK0103,765,I see, so we can't get inside then.
SK0103,766,Yep. Members of the theater need to lock their rooms if they aren't going to be here.
SK0103,767,Then we just have to move on. Let's head to another room.
SK0103,768,Guess we just have to move on. Let's head to another room.
SK0103,769,Oh right, Kanna's not here. We'll just go to another room then.
SK0103,770,This is Orihime's room.
SK0103,771,Yes? Who is it?
SK0103,772,Uh, it's Ogami.
SK0103,773,I thought I already told you. No night patrol!
SK0103,774,I'm going to sleep now, so don't ask me again!
SK0103,775,Let's just get going, Ogami. She'll get angry again if we keep insisting.
SK0103,776,Ogami, she'll just get angry if we keep pestering her.
SK0103,777,The name plate has a simple design, but it sure looks classy.
SK0103,778,...Let's just check another room.
SK0103,779,This is Orihime's room.
SK0103,780,Oh, right. Wait a second.
SK0103,781,I wonder if she's all right.
SK0103,782,Open the door.
SK0103,783,Knock first.
SK0103,784,Open the door.
SK0103,785,I'm worried about her, let's go inside.
SK0103,786,Ogami! It's rude to enter someone's room without permission!
SK0103,787,I can't wait any longer. Come on, we're going in.
SK0103,788,E-Ensign?! What are you doing here?
SK0103,789,Uh, it's... I was worried why you hadn't left your room...
SK0103,790,I was just fixing my hair!
SK0103,791,I can't believe you would just barge into another people's room like that!
SK0103,792,Get out! I'm not doing your stupid patrol anymore!
SK0103,793,I knew Orihime would get angry at you, Ogami.
SK0103,794,Looks like we'll have to continue the patrol with just the two of us.
SK0103,795,Orihime, is everything OK in there?
SK0103,796,Just a second.
SK0103,797,Thanks for waiting! I was just fixing my hair.
SK0103,798,(Huh? All that time just for that?)
SK0103,799,OK, let's continue our patrol!
SK0103,800,Thanks for waiting! I was just fixing my hair.
SK0103,801,(Huh? All that time just for that?)
SK0103,802,OK, let's continue our patrol!
SK0103,803,Everything's all right in my room. Let's check another!
SK0103,804,This is Maria's room. She visiting America right now.
SK0103,805,Oh, so she left before I got here.
SK0103,806,We can't go inside, then.
SK0103,807,Yep. Members of the theater need to lock their rooms if they aren't going to be here.
SK0103,808,We can't do much right now, so we better check another room.
SK0103,809,Maria is in America, huh. Let's check another room, then.
SK0103,810,Huh? The door's open.
SK0103,811,I wonder if something happened, let's peek inside.
SK0103,812,Iris isn't here. Where would she go at this hour?
SK0103,813,Perhaps she went to toilet?
SK0103,814,Ogami, let's look for her while we check the rest of the theater.
SK0103,815,Yeah, let's go.
SK0103,816,I wonder where Iris went.
SK0103,817,Hmmm... She's not here.
SK0103,818,I wonder, where is she?
SK0103,819,I wonder if she's already went back to bed.
SK0103,820,Zzz... Zzz...
SK0103,821,Hehe, she's already sound asleep.
SK0103,822,Good grief, kids are so carefree.
SK0103,823,That's a relief. OK, let's get back to our patrol.
SK0103,824,Ogami, Iris is sleeping, so let's leave her alone.
SK0103,825,You're right. Let's continue our patrol, then.
SK0103,826,This is Kohran's room. She's at the Hanayashiki Branch for work right now.
SK0103,827,Hanayashiki Branch? What's that?
SK0103,828,It's the Imperial Assault Troupe's research lab in Asakusa.
SK0103,829,On the surface it's an amusement park, but the workshop and labs are located below ground.
SK0103,830,Oh.
SK0103,831,Since Kohran is away, we can't go inside.
SK0103,832,Yep. Members of the theater need to lock their rooms if they aren't going to be here.
SK0103,833,Guess we just have to move on. Let's head to another room.
SK0103,834,Kohran's at Hanayashiki right now. Guess we'll have to check another room.
SK0103,835,This is Sumire's room. At the moment she's back home with her family.
SK0103,836,Can't she still commute if she lives so close by?
SK0103,837,I think she has a lot of family matters to attend to right now.
SK0103,838,Her door's locked. Let's head to another room.
SK0103,839,Sumire went back to her family home. Guess we'll just have to check another room. 
SK0103,840,This is the Attic. Seems that no one's here.
SK0103,841,The windows are all locked tight as well.
SK0103,842,Everything's fine, then. Let's check another room.
SK0103,843,This is the Attic. Seems that no one's here.
SK0103,844,The windows are all locked tight as well.
SK0103,845,Hmmm...
SK0103,846,Huh? Something wrong, Orihime?
SK0103,847,Oh, no. It's nothing.
SK0103,848,Let's get to the next room right away!
SK0103,849,Looks like everything's in order here. Let's check another room.
SK0103,850,It's 10 o'clock.
SK0103,851,We finished our night watch. Great job, Ogami. 
SK0103,852,You too, Sakura. Thanks for coming with me.
SK0103,853,Don't mention it.
SK0103,854,I'll walk you to your room.
SK0103,855,Good night.
SK0103,856,I'll walk you back to your room.
SK0103,857,But Ogami, we're already at my room.
SK0103,858,Ah, right, now that you mention it.
SK0103,859,Hehe... That funny side of you has never changed, Ogami.
SK0103,860,I'll just appreciate the offer, then. Thank you very much.
SK0103,861,Now, if you excuse me. Good night.
SK0103,862,Yeah, good night.
SK0103,863,Now, I better get back to my room, too.
SK0103,864,Is that OK with you?
SK0103,865,Of course. Let's go.
SK0103,866,Thank you so much for taking me back to my room.
SK0103,867,Tomorrow, I'll ask Orihime to join our rehearsal.
SK0103,868,It'll be a good chance to chat with her.
SK0103,869,Thanks, Ogami. Good night.
SK0103,870,Yeah, good night.
SK0103,871,Now, I better get back to my room, too.
SK0103,872,Well, take care on your way back, Sakura. Good night.
SK0103,873,Thank you, Ogami. Now if you excuse me, good night.
SK0103,874,Now, I better get back to my room, too.
SK0103,875,I'll excuse myself now. Good night, Ogami.
SK0103,876,Yeah, good night.
SK0103,877,Now, I better get back to my room, too.
SK0103,878,It's 10 o'clock.
SK0103,879,We finished our night watch. Great job, Ogami. 
SK0103,880,And thank you for coming with us, Orihime.
SK0103,881,There's not a lot of room in the theater, so it was a good chance to stretch my legs.
SK0103,882,We'll part here.
SK0103,883,I'll take you two to your room.
SK0103,884,Good night, you two.
SK0103,885,I'll take you two to your room.
SK0103,886,But Ogami, we're already at my room.
SK0103,887,Ah, right, now that you mention it.
SK0103,888,Hehe... That funny side of you has never changed, Ogami.
SK0103,889,Funny" side more like "oblivious" to me.
SK0103,890,Ogami, would you like to escort Orihime so she won't get lost?
SK0103,891,Thank you, but I vehemently reject that idea.
SK0103,892,Imagining myself being escorted by a Japanese man makes my hair stand on end.
SK0103,893,I'll take my leave now. Good night.
SK0103,894,Oh, boy... Seems that she really hates me.
SK0103,895,Tomorrow, I'll ask Orihime to join our rehearsal.
SK0103,896,It'll be a good chance to chat with her.
SK0103,897,Thanks again, Ogami. Good night.
SK0103,898,Yeah, good night.
SK0103,899,Now, I better get back to my room, too.
SK0103,900,Excuse me, but my room is right there, behind you guys.
SK0103,901,Ah, right, now that you mention it.
SK0103,902,Uh-huh... Ensign really is as dumb as he looks, huh.
SK0103,903,And one more thing, I vehemently reject the idea of you walking me to my room.
SK0103,904,Imagining myself being escorted by a Japanese man makes my hair stand on end.
SK0103,905,I'll take my leave now. Good night.
SK0103,906,Oh, boy... Seems that she really hates me.
SK0103,907,I'll walk you to your room, Sakura.
SK0103,908,I'll take you up on that offer. Thank you.
SK0103,909,Thanks for taking me back to my room.
SK0103,910,Tomorrow, I'll ask Orihime to join our rehearsal.
SK0103,911,It'll be a good chance to chat with her.
SK0103,912,Thanks again, Ogami. Good night.
SK0103,913,Yeah, good night.
SK0103,914,Now, I better get back to my room, too.
SK0103,915,Is that OK with you?
SK0103,916,Of course. Let's go.
SK0103,917,Thank you, but I vehemently reject that idea.
SK0103,918,Imagining myself being escorted by a Japanese man makes my hair stand on end.
SK0103,919,I'll take my leave now. Good night.
SK0103,920,Oh, boy... Seems that she really hates me.
SK0103,921,I'll walk you to your room, Sakura.
SK0103,922,I'll take you up on that offer. Thank you.
SK0103,923,Thanks for taking me back to my room.
SK0103,924,Tomorrow, I'll ask Orihime to join our rehearsal.
SK0103,925,It'll be a good chance to chat with her.
SK0103,926,Thanks again, Ogami. Good night.
SK0103,927,Yeah, good night.
SK0103,928,Now, I better get back to my room, too.
SK0103,929,Well, take care on your way back, Sakura. Good night.
SK0103,930,No need to say anything to me, I'll be headed back right away.
SK0103,931,I'm leaving too, Ogami. Good night.
SK0103,932,Now, I better get back to my room, too.
SK0103,933,Excuse us for now. Good night, Ogami.
SK0103,934,Yeah, good night.
SK0103,935,Now, I better get back to my room, too.
SK0103,936,I wonder if Orihime and I can ever get along...
SK0103,937,It is my duty to make sure that happens. But, we still have a long way to go.
SK0103,938,Ogami, have you finished sorting those receipts?
SK0103,939,Just a little bit!
SK0103,940,Phew, it's hard to do this stuff again such a long time.
SK0103,941,OK, just need to finish counting these receipts and we're done.
SK0103,942,Um, how many is it... 126, 127, 128...
SK0103,943,Ogami, are you done yet?
SK0103,944,Hold on, just a little bit more!
SK0103,945,Uh-oh, how many receipts was it? What was the next number?
SK0103,946,127?
SK0103,947,129?
SK0103,948,131?
SK0103,949,127 receipts, I guess. OK... 128, 129, 130, 131, 132...
SK0103,950,OK, all done! I'm free at last!
SK0103,951,129 receipts, I guess. OK... 130, 131, 132, 133, 134...
SK0103,952,OK, all done! I'm free at last!
SK0103,953,131 receipts, I guess. OK... 132, 133, 134, 135, 136...
SK0103,954,OK, all done! I'm free at last!
SK0103,955,Oh, dang. I forgot how many receipts I counted!
SK0103,956,Guees I'll just wing it. Right, 401, 402, 403...
SK0103,957,Great work, Ogami.
SK0103,958,I haven't sorted receipts in a while. Sorry it took me so long.
SK0103,959,Too bad our performance hasn't started yet, you couldn't do \nyour "actual" job as a ticket puncher.
SK0103,960,Well, it's not that big a disappointment to me.
SK0103,961,Ogami, I double-checked the receipts that you counted, and it seems that you were short by two.
SK0103,962,Really? Looks like I miscounted somewhere, sorry.
SK0103,963,No, it's fine. I understand you haven't done this in a long time.
SK0103,964,Thank you very much. We'll reach out to you again if there's something we need help with.
SK0103,965,Your count matches with our records, Ogami. Thank you so much for helping us.
SK0103,966,Oh, glad to hear that. I was worried I might have miscounted them or something.
SK0103,967,Way to go, Ogami! You're great at doing all sorts of odd-jobs.
SK0103,968,Uh-huh... I wonder if I should be happy about that.
SK0103,969,Ogami, I double-checked the receipts that you counted, and it seems that you counted two extra.
SK0103,970,Really? Looks like I miscounted somewhere, sorry.
SK0103,971,No, it's fine. I understand you haven't done this in a long time.
SK0103,972,Thank you very much. We'll reach out to you again if there's something we need help with.
SK0103,973,Ogami, I double-checked the receipts that you counted, and your counts are messed up.
SK0103,974,I'm sorry, truth is I lost count while I was working on it.
SK0103,975,I understand that you haven't done this job in ages, but please be more careful next time.
SK0103,976,I'm really sorry, I'll try to pay more attention.
SK0103,977,Well, I'm leaving. Thanks for having me.
SK0103,978,Thank you for your hard work!
SK0103,979,It's already evening. Man, I've been sorting receipts all day.
SK0103,980,I wonder if the gift shop is still open. Or perhaps I should visit the rehearsal.
SK0103,981,Visit the gift shop.
SK0103,982,Visit the rehearsal.
SK0103,983,I'll visit the gift shop, maybe Tsubaki's there.
SK0103,984,Hey, Ogami! Would you like to buy something?
SK0103,985,Buy a photo.
SK0103,986,Talk to Tsubaki.
SK0103,987,Leave.
SK0103,988,Could I buy a photo?
SK0103,989,Ogami, I think you already bought one.
SK0103,990,We need to keep enough in stock for the other customers, so please enjoy the one you bought for now.
SK0103,991,You'd like to buy a photo? Thank you very much!
SK0103,992,Oh, right, I have a request to make, Ogami...
SK0103,993,We need to keep enough photos in stock for the other visitors, so please limit your purchases to one per month.
SK0103,994,While I'm sure you'd like to collect more, I hope you'll understand the need to do this for the sake of our patrons.
SK0103,995,That's a photo of Sakura.
SK0103,996,It seems like Sakura was really looking forward to your return, Ogami.
SK0103,997,How about buying a photo to show your support for her?
SK0103,998,Let's see... Sakura's photo, right?
SK0103,999,That'll be 50 sen. Thank you very much!
SK0103,1000,That's a photo of Sumire.
SK0103,1001,Sumire is at her family's home right now.
SK0103,1002,Let's see... Sumire's photo, right?
SK0103,1003,That'll be 50 sen. Thank you very much!
SK0103,1004,That's a photo of Maria.
SK0103,1005,Maria's currently in America, escorting Count Hanakoji.
SK0103,1006,Let's see... Maria's photo, right?
SK0103,1007,That'll be 50 sen. Thank you very much!
SK0103,1008,That's a photo of Kanna.
SK0103,1009,Kanna's back home in Okinawa to do some karate training at the moment.
SK0103,1010,Let's see... Kanna's photo, right?
SK0103,1011,That'll be 50 sen. Thank you very much!
SK0103,1012,That's a photo of Iris.
SK0103,1013,I bet Iris would be pretty lonely without everybody in the Flower Division keeping her company.
SK0103,1014,Make sure you're kind to her, Ogami.
SK0103,1015,Let's see... Iris's photo, right?
SK0103,1016,That'll be 50 sen. Thank you very much!
SK0103,1017,That's a photo of Kohran.
SK0103,1018,Kohran's off doing some work at the Hanayashiki Branch right now.
SK0103,1019,Let's see... Kohran's photo, right?
SK0103,1020,That'll be 50 sen. Thank you very much!
SK0103,1021,You don't want to buy anything? That's too bad...
SK0103,1022,Orihime joined the Flower Division just recently, she's a beautiful actress!
SK0103,1023,I'm looking forward to seeing what kind of performance she can pull off.
SK0103,1024,Haha... Well, I suppose you're right.
SK0103,1025,We're going to start selling Orihime's photo starting next month, so please look forward to that in the future.
SK0103,1026,There will be a special bonus for customers who buy a photo every month.
SK0103,1027,Bonus? What kind is it?
SK0103,1028,Hehehe... It's a secret!
SK0103,1029,Well, I should be going. Keep up the good work.
SK0103,1030,Thank you very much! Come back again soon!
SK0103,1031,Thank you very much! Come back and buy another photo next month!
SK0103,1032,I'll visit the rehearsal next. I wonder if Orihime is getting along with the other.
SK0103,1033,Mon Frère!!
SK0103,1034,Iris, what happened? Why are you over here? 
SK0103,1035,Listen, we were doing rehearsal onstage.
SK0103,1036,And then, Orihime started fighting with Sakura. We're in trouble!
SK0103,1037,Wha... What did you say?
SK0103,1038,Please break up their fight, Mon Frère. Please!
SK0103,1039,OK, I got you. We're going there right away!
SK0103,1040,Right here, Mon Frère! Quick!
SK0103,1041,Like I said! No matter how many times you do it, this rehearsal is pointless!
SK0103,1042,It's just like Iris said. They're getting pretty heated up.
SK0103,1043,It's not useless! Reading though our lines is important for  rehearsal.
SK0103,1044,How do you think we're supposed to act if we don't do a read-through beforehand?
SK0103,1045,What's important in performing on stage is inspiration!
SK0103,1046,To act is to have a talent. There's no need to for me to rehearse like this!
SK0103,1047,But read-through also works as a practice session for the actors so that they can get in sync with each other.
SK0103,1048,I want us to get along and coordinated for our upcoming performance.
SK0103,1049,That's why I suggested a rehearsal so our acting can synchronize with each other.
SK0103,1050,MY acting is on a different level than your "acting."
SK0103,1051,You guys have the wrong idea. The stage is just like any battlefield.
SK0103,1052,You don't need to pretend to be my friend anymore. I'm out of here.
SK0103,1053,Ah, Orihime! Wait, please!
SK0103,1054,Orihime!
SK0103,1055,Oh, Ensign? Eavesdropping on us? What a nice hobby.
SK0103,1056,Y-You got it all wrong! I'm just worried about you two!
SK0103,1057,Just as I thought. Japanese men are the worst.
SK0103,1058,You're a meddlesome coward. On top of that, you like to stick your nose in other people's business.
SK0103,1059,And Cherry- Er, Sakura lacks any sense at all. Non ha senso! I can’t stand her!
SK0103,1060,I'm going back to Italy. Now, out of my way!
SK0103,1061,Stay there.
SK0103,1062,Move out of the way.
SK0103,1063,No, I'm staying right here.
SK0103,1064,Are you deaf? I said, get out of my way!
SK0103,1065,No, I will not. I'm not going to let you leave here like that.
SK0103,1066,Hmph... Seems that my words aren't enough to make you understand. 
SK0103,1067,Uwah!
SK0103,1068,Ah, Mon frère!
SK0103,1069,O-Ogami!
SK0103,1070,There, now you're dripping with charm.
SK0103,1071,I don't care if you're the captain or whatever, stop meddling in other peoples' business.
SK0103,1072,From your perspective, it may look like I'm sticking my nose into your business.
SK0103,1073,I was hoping that you could get along with everyone in the Flower Division.
SK0103,1074,Orihime, I'm asking you as a fellow member of the division, please stand with us.
SK0103,1075,Stand together, in the Imperial Theater and on the battlefield.
SK0103,1076,Mon Frère...
SK0103,1077,Ogami...
SK0103,1078,...
SK0103,1079,OK, I'll move.
SK0103,1080,Ha! How nice of you to be so considerate.
SK0103,1081,For a cowardly and boorish Japanese man like yourself, I'm impressed.
SK0103,1082,Well now, I'm going back to my room!
SK0103,1083,Hold it, Orihime! Aren't you also being a coward by running away like that?
SK0103,1084,What do you mean by that, Sakura?
SK0103,1085,To quit and run away in the middle of rehearsal, you're a coward, too!
SK0103,1086,...
SK0103,1087,It's true that I may look like an amateur in front of you.
SK0103,1088,That's why I want to rehearse, so that I learn lots of things from you!
SK0103,1089,Please stand with us on the stage, Orihime!
SK0103,1090,And please stand together with us on the battlefield! Become one of our comrades in the Flower Division!
SK0103,1091,Hmm...
SK0103,1092,...
SK0103,1093,So you're ignoring me? Fine, I'll just force my way past you!
SK0103,1094,Ah!
SK0103,1095,What's that sound?
SK0103,1096,It's time to suit up for a mission! We have enemies incoming!
SK0103,1097,I'm asking you once again, Orihime.
SK0103,1098,Please fight together with us, as a member of the Flower Division.
SK0103,1099,...
SK0103,1100,This'll be fun! I've always wanted to run wild during a battle in Japan at least once.
SK0103,1101,I'll show you guys my true power, the power of a world class actress!
SK0103,1102,Thanks a lot, Orihime.
SK0103,1103,Just so you know, this is the only time I'll head into battle.
SK0103,1104,OK, Orihime, let's head to the Command Room right away!
SK0103,1105,Imperial Assault Troupe, Flower Division, assembled!
SK0103,1106,Hm, great work. Seems like Orihime even managed to get here as well.
SK0103,1107,Ooooh. So we have a room like this in the basement, huh?
SK0103,1108,This is our Command Room, the heart of the Imperial Assault Troupe.
SK0103,1109,The Theater is just a cover to keep out of the public eye. The troupe's real job is to protect the capital.
SK0103,1110,This will be your first battle since coming back to us, Ogami.
SK0103,1111,This is amazing. I'm suddenly not afraid of anything anymore because you're here with us, Ogami.
SK0103,1112,I know that we won't lose as long you're here! 
SK0103,1113,Let's do our best for the sake of peace, Ogami!
SK0103,1114,If you're in danger, I'll come to save you, Mon Frère!
SK0103,1115,Let's do our best together!
SK0103,1116,I'll show all of you my bountiful abilities!
SK0103,1117,I can't believe I'm tagging along. Guess I'm curious, too.
SK0103,1118,Thanks, everyone. I'm counting on you!
SK0103,1119,Good. Now then, Ogami, is there anything you want to ask?
SK0103,1120,About the enemy
SK0103,1121,About Orihime's uniform
SK0103,1122,Nothing in particular
SK0103,1123,I'd like to know about the enemies. What kind will we be encountering?
SK0103,1124,Hm... The thing is, we're still unsure.
SK0103,1125,But what we do know is that something with lots of spirit power is headed straight for us.
SK0103,1126,What? Then their target must be...
SK0103,1127,Yes. It's possible they are targeting us, the Flower Division, in this theater.
SK0103,1128,Also, the sun has set. It's going to be a nighttime battle, so be on your guard.
SK0103,1129,Orihime, your uniform is different from ours.
SK0103,1130,This is my uniform from when I was assigned to the "Star Division."
SK0103,1131,Star Division?
SK0103,1132,It was a test squad that was formed before the Flower Division.
SK0103,1133,They gathered pilots from all around the world to form that elite unit. 
SK0103,1134,That's right! In terms of experience, I'm your senior!
SK0103,1135,Now, one more thing I need to tell you before you deploy.
SK0103,1136,We can't fight the monsters who attack Tokyo with just our bodies.
SK0103,1137,That's why you're all piloting mechanical armor, or rather, "Spirit Armor."
SK0103,1138,My Spi-rit-Ar-mor is also ready, too!
SK0103,1139,I'll show you all your new Spirit Armor. We're going to the Hangar now.
SK0103,1140,T-These are our new Spirit Armor!?
SK0103,1141,Correct. These are new revisions of the old “Koubu” models. Thus we’ve named them the “Koubu Kai.”
SK0103,1142,They've got increased power output after we studied and modified the ones we lost in our previous battle.  
SK0103,1143,These Koubu are still the same, only people with enough spirit power can pilot them.
SK0103,1144,You all are the ones who possess that spirit power.
SK0103,1145,The safety of Tokyo depends on the Flower Division. I'm counting on you!
SK0103,1146,Roger!
SK0103,1147,Ogami!
SK0103,1148,What is it, Sakura? Did something happen?
SK0103,1149,Orihime said that she was moving out by herself and then left!
SK0103,1150,W-What the?!
SK0103,1151,That's... That's the sound of a Spirit Armor's engine!
SK0103,1152,It's coming from the Hangar. It's must be her!
SK0103,1153,Wh-What is that?!
SK0103,1154,Heya, Ensign! I'm going to head out first!
SK0103,1155,With my "Eisenkleid" from the Star Division, I can take care of everything myself. 
SK0103,1156,W-Wait up, Orihime!!
SK0103,1157,This is a perfect chance to show my power to you guys.
SK0103,1158,I'm going first, guys! Orihime Soletta moving out!
SK0103,1159,What in the world. Heading off alone into battle is reckless!
SK0103,1160,Orihime got your hands tied, huh, Ogami?
SK0103,1161,Remember, protecting, covering, and getting your squadmates to open up to you is your duty as captain of the Flower Division.
SK0103,1162,Now go, Ogami! I'm leaving Ginza and Orihime in your hands!
SK0103,1163,Ogami, give the order!
SK0103,1164,Imperial Assault Troupe, Flower Division, move out!
SK0103,1165,Prepare for cherry blossom viewing!
SK0103,1166,We're going to join up with Orihime and take out the enemy! Imperial Assault Troop, Flower Division, move out!
SK0103,1167,Understood!
SK0103,1168,Let's do this, Mon Frère!
SK0103,1169,We're gonna protect the capital!
SK0103,1170,OK, we're gonna prepare for cherry blossom viewing!
SK0103,1171,Whaaat!? We're going to see the cherry blossoms now?
SK0103,1172,I get it! We're going to redo Orihime's welcoming party after we win this battle, right?
SK0103,1173,General Yoneda, please get things ready for our cherry blossom party!
SK0103,1174,Yep, I'll leave this matter to you! Hehe, make sure I can enjoy my best sake!
SK0103,1175,You can count on us! Let's go, Ogami! Moving out!
SK0103,1176,Hey, Ogami! Don't just stand there! Give the order!
SK0103,1177,Oh... R-Right.
SK0103,1178,Here goes... Imperial Assault Troupe, Flower Division, move out! Our destination is...
SK0103,1179,Uh... Where was it, again?
SK0103,1180,I told you, it's Ginza! Ginza! Right in front of the Theater!
SK0103,1181,Are you all right, Mon Frère?
SK0103,1182,He's just got back to the Flower Division, so he probably hasn't gotten used to being in battle yet.
SK0103,1183,We're going now, Ogami! Flower Division, move out!
SK0103,1184,Sorry, Ogami, but each customer is only allowed to purchase one photo at a time.
SK0103,1185,I see. That's too bad...
SK0103,1186,My apologies, Ogami, but each customer is only allowed to purchase one photo at a time.
SK0103,1187,Oh, really? That's too bad...

SK0104,1,Let’s return to the Imperial Theater, Ogami.
SK0104,2,Wait... Wait.
SK0104,3,...!
SK0104,4,Hahaha. I am unable to live as a human being, and yet unable to die.
SK0104,5,I once fought you under the name Cerulean Satan and lost this body.
SK0104,6,Listen well. The hatred you feel towards evil will only grow stronger...
SK0104,7,... until the evil within you awakens as well.
SK0104,8,Yamazaki...
SK0104,9,Yamazaki!?
SK0104,10,Heh. It's been a while, Yoneda.
SK0104,11,I didn't want to see you in the state I am now.
SK0104,12,Yamazaki！
SK0104,13,How many times did I tell you not to trust in power alone?!
SK0104,14,Isn't the justice you all hold so dear nothing more than power, in the end?
SK0104,15,In this world, there is no justice to be had without absolute power!
SK0104,16,That’s not true, Yamazaki!
SK0104,17,No! Humans don't deserve to be protected.
SK0104,18,You do not know the sorrows of this city!
SK0104,19,Nor the capital's ancient, accumulated grudge!
SK0104,20,My soul... is beginning to wane.
SK0104,21,But remember, the curse of this city will continue.
SK0104,22,It is cursed! Cursed! Hahahahahahahaha!
SK0104,23,Demon King, was it? Just who is he?
SK0104,24,Mon Frère, I'm scared...
SK0104,25,That clown in the Carnival mask had such bloodlust.
SK0104,26,That man smells of death and destruction.
SK0104,27,Is he our new enemy?
SK0104,28,I don’t know...
SK0104,29,He said something about the city being cursed. What did he mean by that?
SK0104,30,I don't think there is any point in wondering over something you do not know.
SK0104,31,Just be happy that we won.
SK0104,32,You're right. Now, why don't we go home to our theater?
SK0104,33,All right, everyone. Let's head back to the theater!
SK0104,34,Mission complete! The Imperial Assault Troupe, Flower Division, all mechs returning!
SK0104,35,Come on! Drink up, Ogami, drink up!
SK0104,36,Hahahaha. Kind of a bittersweet occasion to drink. Ahaha...
SK0104,37,Mr. Yoneda, let's drink a lot today!
SK0104,38,Oh, by the way, Orihime, didn't you say you were leaving after the battle?
SK0104,39,Yes, that was the plan, but it seems that you would all be in some trouble without my help.
SK0104,40,So I thought, well, I can stay here for a bit longer.
SK0104,41,Ah, thank you, Orihime!
SK0104,42,That's great, Ogami. Orihime will stay with the Flower Division!
SK0104,43,You know what, we should redo the welcome party today.
SK0104,44,Yes. Once again, Orihime, we look forward to working with you.
SK0104,45,Just so you know, my distaste for Japanese men will not be changing.
SK0104,46,Oh, Ok...
SK0104,47,It's all right, because I love you sooo much!
SK0104,48,Hahaha, thank you Iris.
SK0104,49,By the way, Mr. Yoneda, who's the enemy this time?
SK0104,50,I don't know. What I do know for sure though, is that no matter what kind of bastard you're dealing with...
SK0104,51,We must protect the sanctity of the capital and the lives of its people.
SK0104,52,...Yes, sir!
SK0104,53,All right, drink and be merry! We're going to have a good time today, so let's party!
SK0104,54,It's a new beginning for the Flower Division!
SK0104,55,And we're celebrating Ogami's return to doing all sorts of odd-jobs! Starting tomorrow, you'll be working hard!

SK0104,101,... "" "" () - . , ! ? ?! !!
SK0201,1,Ever since the attack on Ginza last month, it seems like something's been weighing on Mr. Yoneda's mind.
SK0201,2,Whenever I've asked him about it, he just gives me some vague response. I wonder what I should do...
SK0201,3,Oh! Look like a call's coming in. Who could it be?
SK0201,4,Ah, Ogami, you're there.
SK0201,5,Sir! What is it?
SK0201,6,There's something I wanted to discuss with you. Would you mind coming to the command room down in the basement?
SK0201,7,Right, understood.
SK0201,8,Mr. Yoneda...
SK0201,9,What on earth is going on? He even contacted me by communicator...
SK0201,10,All right. For the moment, I should go see him.
SK0201,11,Are you there, sir?
SK0201,12,Oh, it's you, Ogami.
SK0201,13,Take a look at this screen here.
SK0201,14,Th-That man...
SK0201,15,S-Sir! This man is...
SK0201,16,Yes. The man who orchestrated the attack on the theater last month...
SK0201,17,His name is Shinnosuke Yamazaki. He and I were once comrades who fought side by side.
SK0201,18,A new enemy has emerged in the capital once again, I wonder just who it could be.
SK0201,19,And I've been wondering, too, about why he appeared before us as that way.
SK0201,20,Have anything to ask me? If you don't mind me speculating about a few things, go ahead.
SK0201,21,Ask about the new adversary.
SK0201,22,Ask about Shinnosuke Yamazaki.
SK0201,23,Nothing to ask about.
SK0201,24,What is the nature of this enemy that appeared recently?
SK0201,25,I'm not really sure, myself. I know zilch about this organization or what their objective may be.
SK0201,26,But based on what Yamazaki said, that the capital is a cursed city...
SK0201,27,And whoever that masked man was that killed him with a single strike was...
SK0201,28,It's likely that his objective, whatever it may be, has to do with Tokyo.
SK0201,29,Do you know anything about the man called Shinnosuke Yamazaki?
SK0201,30,Yes, I do.
SK0201,31,Just the name...
SK0201,32,No, nothing at all.
SK0201,33,Yes, I do. He was a friend and fellow soldier of yours who fought with you during the Kouma War.
SK0201,34,...Yes, that's right.
SK0201,35,I know the name, but not much more than that.
SK0201,36,I might've mentioned him before, but I'll tell you about him.
SK0201,37,No, nothing at all.
SK0201,38,Yeah, I'm not surprised you don't know.
SK0201,39,...
SK0201,40,Well, no surprise there. It was... a long time ago.
SK0201,41,Ten years ago, a special squad was established in the Imperial Army called the "Anti-Kouma Corps."
SK0201,42,It was a combat squad with the mission of defending the capital from demonic forces, much like the current-day troupe.
SK0201,43,Seven years ago, we went into battle with an enormous Kouma that appeared in Nihonbashi.
SK0201,44,That was the start of what's called the "Kouma War."
SK0201,45,But that war turned out to be the Anti-Kouma Corps' final battle. 
SK0201,46,This here's a photo from back then. As you can see, Ayame Fujieda, who was once part of our troupe, is here too.
SK0201,47,After the Kouma War, Ayame served as the Assault Troupe's deputy commander...
SK0201,48,But in our previous battle, she gave everything she had to keep the peace, and lost her life for it.
SK0201,49,...
SK0201,50,The man on the far right there is Kazuma Shinguji, Sakura's father. He died at the very end of the Kouma War.
SK0201,51,Ayame and I are in the middle, and the man on the left is... Yamazaki.
SK0201,52,Did you know that the one who originally came up with the design for Spirit Armor was Yamazaki?
SK0201,53,He was more than just a warrior, he was a genius in the truest sense of the word.
SK0201,54,But after the Kouma War was over, he vanished.
SK0201,55,What he got up to after that... Well, I have no idea.
SK0201,56,Still, I never imagined I'd end up meeting him again in that form, or that we'd wind up parting how we did...
SK0201,57,...
SK0201,58,Kazuma, Ayame, and even Yamazaki... They've all left this world.
SK0201,59,And in the end, I'm the only one still alive...
SK0201,60,...
SK0201,61,I'm not much more than a pathetic, lonely old soldier who missed his time to die.
SK0201,62,Mr. Yoneda...
SK0201,63,What are you saying?!
SK0201,64,Please, cheer up.
SK0201,65,That really is pathetic.
SK0201,66,What are you saying?! You're not alone, sir.
SK0201,67,What's that?
SK0201,68,All of us in the Flower Division are here for you.
SK0201,69,Being away from the theater meant that I was separated from all my allies who I'd fought together with.
SK0201,70,But because I kept on living, I was able to reunite with everyone and enjoy being together with them again.
SK0201,71,Ogami...
SK0201,72,There's nothing shameful about being the one who survived.
SK0201,73,So please, don't talk like you should have died already.
SK0201,74,...
SK0201,75,Wahahaha! You moron, I was only jokin' around. Don't take me so seriously.
SK0201,76,...Right.
SK0201,77,Please, cheer up, sir. It's not like you to be so depressed.
SK0201,78,Huh? It's not like me?
SK0201,79,That's right. The Yoneda I know is a man with a hearty laugh and a love for a good drink.
SK0201,80,If you get depressed, the rest of us will start to worry about you and lose heart ourselves.
SK0201,81,...Hahaha. You got a point. I'm actin' all mopey, aren't I?
SK0201,82,Still, Ogami, you think the real me is all about laughing and drinking, eh?
SK0201,83,Huh?! No, that's not what I... Uh...
SK0201,84,Ah, it's fine. Let's just leave it at that.
SK0201,85,Yeah, that is pathetic.
SK0201,86,...What was that?
SK0201,87,Sir, you taught me that so long as I didn't gripe about every little thing, the way forward would open up to me.
SK0201,88,So how can you just sit there whining like that?!
SK0201,89,...
SK0201,90,Wahahaha! You moron, I was only jokin' around. Don't take me so seriously.
SK0201,91,...Right.
SK0201,92,...
SK0201,93,Eh, whassamatter, Ogami? That's one hell of a depressing look on your face.
SK0201,94,I-It's nothing...
SK0201,95,Hahaha. Don't you go gettin' all apprehensive, now.
SK0201,96,You're the captain. You walk around lookin' like that, it'll affect your squad's morale.
SK0201,97,...Sir.
SK0201,98,I've still got plenty of stuff I need you to do.
SK0201,99,I'm gonna work ya hard starting today, Ogami, so better get yourself prepared!
SK0201,100,Y-Yes, sir!
SK0201,101,Now then, I'm gonna be here a while longer. But you oughta go get the newcomer's welcome party ready.
SK0201,102,Huh? We've got another new member coming in?!
SK0201,103,That's right. Today at 12 o'clock sharp, we have one new member joining our ranks. So get going!
SK0201,104,Y-Yes, sir! Please excuse me!
SK0201,105,...
SK0201,106,Don't talk like I should have died, huh...
SK0201,107,Look at me, gettin' lectured by him. Heh, well, I sure didn't see that coming.
SK0201,108,Ogami. Iris, Orihime, and I are all here, just like you asked.
SK0201,109,What'd you wanna talk about, Mon Frère?
SK0201,110,Good news, I just spoke with Mr. Yoneda.
SK0201,111,It turns out the Flower Division is getting another new member.
SK0201,112,Wooow, really?! Hey, hey, what kind of person is she?
SK0201,113,Hmm... I don't really know the details, myself.
SK0201,114,Say, let's throw her a great big welcome party!
SK0201,115,But we already had one of those, not so long ago...
SK0201,116,So what? Let's do it! I loooove parties!
SK0201,117,Of course...
SK0201,118,All right, let's do it!
SK0201,119,We did have one recently, didn't we?
SK0201,120,All right, let's do it!
SK0201,121,We did have one recently, didn't we?
SK0201,122,I hope she's cute.
SK0201,123,All right, let's do it! You all threw that welcome party for me, after all.
SK0201,124,Right! That's what we do here in the Flower Division!
SK0201,125,You really are the nicest, Mon Frère!
SK0201,126,We did have one recently, didn't we? How many more of these do we have to do?
SK0201,127,But the party we just had was to welcome you and Orihime, right?
SK0201,128,Come onnn, let's do it, Mon Frère! It'd be sad if the new person didn't get one!
SK0201,129,O-OK, I get it.
SK0201,130,Another new member, huh? I hope she's cute.
SK0201,131,This again, Ogami? You said the same thing when Orihime arrived.
SK0201,132,Eep, y-you remembered that?!
SK0201,133,I certainly did. Ugh, just forget it!
SK0201,134,You're awfully glib these days, aren't you?
SK0201,135,Oh my, Japanese men really are weak-minded and frivolous!
SK0201,136,Is that really all you think about, Ogami?
SK0201,137,N-No, I was... I was just joking, I swear.
SK0201,138,How flustered you appear, Ensign. It seems she was right on the money!
SK0201,139,Hey, hey, we need to hurry before the new person gets here! Let's get ready!
SK0201,140,Y-Yeah, you're right. OK, let's start preparing, everyone.
SK0201,141,Hmm...
SK0201,142,Let's do it, Mon Frère! We're getting a new friend, so we hafta throw a party!
SK0201,143,That's true. OK, let's do it.
SK0201,144,Yes. Let's throw them a fun welcome party.
SK0201,145,Although, it's too bad everyone else can't be here for all these parties.
SK0201,146,(Oh, right. Maria and the others aren't here right now...)
SK0201,147,(Maybe I'll see if I can contact them later on the Cinematron when I get back to my room.)
SK0201,148,Hey Mon Frère, what time should we hold the party?
SK0201,149,According to Manager Yoneda, she'll be arriving around 12 o'clock.
SK0201,150,It's 11 right now, so that gives us about an hour. We should started preparing immediately.
SK0201,151,OK, let's divide up the work and get everything ready.
SK0201,152,We can use this backstage room like we did for the last party.
SK0201,153,Ogami, would you mind lending one of us a hand?
SK0201,154,Sure thing. Let's see, who should I help out...
SK0201,155,Help out Sakura.
SK0201,156,Help out Orihime.
SK0201,157,Help out Iris.
SK0201,158,I'll help you out, Sakura.
SK0201,159,You will? Thank you so much!
SK0201,160,I'll start cleaning up the room. Sorry to bother you with this, but...
SK0201,161,Could you go fetch Tsubaki, Yuri, and Kasumi?
SK0201,162,Yuri and Kasumi should be in the secretarial office, and Tsubaki will probably be at the gift shop.
SK0201,163,Yeah, sure thing. I'll be right back.
SK0201,164,Hey, Mon Frère.
SK0201,165,Hm? What is it, Iris?
SK0201,166,I wanna go with you, too...
SK0201,167,Huh? Well, that's fine, I suppose...
SK0201,168,Yaaay! Then it's decided!
SK0201,169,I'll go with Mon Frère and help get things ready!
SK0201,170,Oh, well then both of you, please go bring Tsubaki and the others here.
SK0201,171,Iris, try not to cause any trouble for Ogami, OK?
SK0201,172,We'll be fiiiine! Mon Frère and I are gonna do our best together!
SK0201,173,...I simply do not see what is so wonderful about Japanese men. Unbelievable.
SK0201,174,A-Anyway, let's get started preparing for this party. Get to work, everyone!
SK0201,175,All right, I'll help out Orihime.
SK0201,176,No, thank you! I do not need any help from the likes of you, Ensign!
SK0201,177,R-Really? Come on, don't be like that...
SK0201,178,What a pest you are. I would prefer that you stop being such an overwhelming busybody!
SK0201,179,Uhh... Well, it wasn't my intention to be a busybody.
SK0201,180,Hey, Mon Frère.
SK0201,181,Hm? What is it, Iris?
SK0201,182,You can help me get things ready.
SK0201,183,Hmm, what to do...
SK0201,184,Aw, c'mon already! Please, Mon Frère? Let's work together!
SK0201,185,Guess I can't refuse when you ask me like that. OK, I'll help you.
SK0201,186,Yaaay! Then that's that!
SK0201,187,In that case, Ogami, can you and Iris get some plates from the kitchen?
SK0201,188,We're having the party in this room, so bring them here if you wouldn't mind.
SK0201,189,You got it. So all we need to do is go to the kitchen and bring some plates back to this room.
SK0201,190,Yay, yaaay! I'm so happy I get to help Mon Frère!
SK0201,191,...I simply do not see what is so wonderful about Japanese men. Unbelievable.
SK0201,192,A-Anyway, let's get started preparing for this party. Get to work, everyone!
SK0201,193,I guess I'll help you out, Iris.
SK0201,194,Yay, thank you! Let's work hard together, Mon Frère!
SK0201,195,In that case, Ogami, can you and Iris get some plates from the kitchen?
SK0201,196,We're having the party in this room, so bring them here if you wouldn't mind.
SK0201,197,You got it. So all we need to do is go to the kitchen and bring some plates back to this room.
SK0201,198,Hey, Mon Frère.
SK0201,199,Hm? What is it, Iris?
SK0201,200,Hee hee. Let's do our best together!
SK0201,201,Yeah. Let's do our best, Iris.
SK0201,202,Yep! I can work real hard because I'm with you, Mon Frère!

SK0202,14,I hope the new girl is cute.
SK0202,15,Mon Frère! Don’t you cheat on me!
SK0202,16,I-Iris! You're starting to sound just like Sakura now!
SK0202,17,I’m your girlfriend, of course I would!
SK0202,18,I don't know what she'll be like...

SK0202,23,The new girl isn't here yet.
SK0202,24,It's not even noon yet. Come on, let's go back inside.
SK0202,25,OK.
SK0202,26,No one's really around when the Flower Division's not putting on a play.
SK0202,27,Well, next month is the summer show. It’ll be full of people again when it starts.
SK0202,28,This place seems so lonely with no one around.
SK0202,29,Hey, Mon Frère, let's go somewhere else!
SK0202,30,Right, let's go.
SK0202,31,Hi there, Ogami! Would you like to buy something?
SK0202,32,Welcome, Ogami! Oh, is that Iris with you?
SK0202,33,Yep, I'm preparing a welcome party with Mon Frère!
SK0202,34,Oh, that's right, I heard from Yuri that there's a new member joining the team.
SK0202,35,Good luck with your preparations, you two!
SK0202,36,Yeah. I’ll do my best!
SK0202,37,Oh, Iris, let me tell you something.
SK0202,38,The first photo Ogami bought when he came back to the theater was yours.
SK0202,39,What? Mon Frère, is that true?
SK0202,40,Oh, yes. That's right.
SK0202,41,Thank you, Mon Frère. I'm... I'm so happy!
SK0202,42,If there was a photo of you, Mon Frère, I'd definitely buy one.
SK0202,43,Hmmm. I don't think my photos would sell very well.
SK0202,44,That’s not true. I'm sure that everyone in the Flower Division would buy one, at least.
SK0202,45,That's right! I'd use my pocket money to buy a whooole bunch of them!
SK0202,46,Hahaha, thank you, Iris.
SK0202,47,By the way, Ogami. What can I do for you?
SK0202,48,Buy a photo
SK0202,49,Talk to Tsubaki
SK0202,50,Leave
SK0202,51,Could I buy a photo?
SK0202,52,Sorry, Ogami. I can only sell one photo to a customer per month.
SK0202,53,Please understand, we need to keep some for the other patrons.
SK0202,54,You'd like to buy a photo? Thank you very much!
SK0202,55,That's a photo of Sakura.
SK0202,56,Let's see... Sakura's photo, right?
SK0202,57,That'll be 50 sen. Thank you very much!
SK0202,58,That's a photo of Sumire.

SK0202,68,Mon Frère, are you going to buy my photo?
SK0202,69,All right, I'll take one of Iris.
SK0202,70,Really? Yay! Yay!
SK0202,71,It's a cute photo. I'll treasure it.
SK0202,72,Thank you, Mon Frère.
SK0202,73,I wish they had your photo, so I could buy it, too...
SK0202,74,Hmm, a photo of me? I don't think they'd sell very well.
SK0202,75,That’s not true. I'm sure that everyone in the Flower Division would buy one, at least.
SK0202,76,That's right! I'd use my pocket money to buy a whooole bunch of them!
SK0202,77,Thank you, Iris.
SK0202,78,OK, Tsubaki, here's the money for the photo. It's 50 sen, right?
SK0202,79,Yes! Thank you as always!
SK0202,80,That's a photo of Kohran.
SK0202,81,Let's see... Kohran's photo, right?
SK0202,82,That'll be 50 sen. Thank you very much!
SK0202,83,That's a photo of Orihime.
SK0202,84,Orihime's photo is finally available for purchase! Don't miss your chance to buy it!
SK0202,85,Let's see... Orihime's photo, right?
SK0202,86,That'll be 50 sen. Thank you very much!
SK0202,87,Oh, so you're not going to buy any?
SK0202,88,Oh right, Tsubaki. We're having a welcome party for the new member backstage at 12 o'clock.
SK0202,89,You should definitely come, too!
SK0202,90,OK, got it! 12 o'clock backstage, right?
SK0202,91,The gift shop closes at noon for lunch, so I'll definitely be there.
SK0202,92,Things always get busy for me when we get new members. 
SK0202,93,I have to make new pamphlets and photos to sell.
SK0202,94,I see. A new photo, huh...?
SK0202,95,I'm sure they'll be ready by next month, so please look forward to them.
SK0202,96,I wonder what time the new member will arrive?
SK0202,97,Well, I should get going. Keep up the good work.
SK0202,98,Thank you, come again! Good luck with preparing for the welcoming party!
SK0202,99,Thank you! Good luck with preparing for the welcoming party!
SK0202,100,Oh right, Tsubaki. We're having a welcome party for the new member backstage at 12 o'clock.
SK0202,101,You should definitely come, too!
SK0202,102,OK, got it! 12 o'clock backstage, right?
SK0202,103,The gift shop closes at noon for lunch, so I'll definitely be there.
SK0202,104,Mon Frère, are you hungry?
SK0202,105,We'll have lots of food at the welcome party, so you'll have to wait.
SK0202,106,Hahaha, right.
SK0202,107,OK, let's get going. We're still getting things ready.
SK0202,108,No one's here. Let's go somewhere else.
SK0202,109,Who was that person just a second ago?
SK0202,110,Ugh, Mon Frère! You always get so lovestruck when you see a pretty woman.
SK0202,111,I-I wouldn't call it "lovestruck" or anything...
SK0202,112,But if she's a guest, I can't be rude to her, right?
SK0202,113,That's true, but...
SK0202,114,...
SK0202,115,Mon Frère, do you like older women?
SK0202,116,I prefer older women.
SK0202,117,I prefer younger women.
SK0202,118,I prefer older women.
SK0202,119,I prefer younger women.
SK0202,120,I don't care about age.
SK0202,121,It'd be nice to be spoiled by an older woman.
SK0202,122,I knew it. So you like them older, don't you, Mon Frère?
SK0202,123,No, no, Iris. I didn't mean anything by it.
SK0202,124,Just you wait. In another ten years, I'll be a grown woman, too!
SK0202,125,So don't cheat on me, Mon Frère!
SK0202,126,Hahaha, OK, I got it, Iris.
SK0202,127,I think I like younger girls better.
SK0202,128,Really!? Yayyy!
SK0202,129,I love you, too, Mon Frère!
SK0202,130,I don't care how old they are.
SK0202,131,That's right. As long as there's love, any difference in age doesn't matter, right?
SK0202,132,Yeah, you're right. Where did you learn to say that?
SK0202,133,Heheh, that's a secret.
SK0202,134,...
SK0202,135,...What's wrong? Did I say something weird?
SK0202,136,It's nothing. I was just thinking about something.
SK0202,137,Thank goodness. I was worried about you.
SK0202,138,Come on, Mon Frère. Let's find the plates and get backstage.
SK0202,139,...Yeah. Plates, plates, plates...
SK0202,140,...
SK0202,141,OK, Iris, there we go.
SK0202,142,Yay! Let's go back to the room, Mon Frère!
SK0202,143,Yes, let's do that. We just take these back, and we're all set.
SK0202,144,Don't take any, Mon Frère!
SK0202,145,There's going to be a lot of food at the welcome party, so let's be patient.
SK0202,146,...I guess so. I'll just have to tough it out.
SK0202,147,Hey there, handsome.
SK0202,148,Can I ask you something?
SK0202,149,S-Sure. What is it?
SK0202,150,Is this the Grand Imperial Theater?
SK0202,151,Yes, it is...
SK0202,152,Thank you very much. Here's a little token of my appreciation.
SK0202,153,*mwah*
SK0202,154,Huh!?
SK0202,155,*GASP*
SK0202,156,Oh my, you're so shy. You're a cutie. I like that.
SK0202,157,Hey, are you free right now? Why don't we go someplace a little nicer?
SK0202,158,I'm working!
SK0202,159,I'd like to get to know you first.
SK0202,160,Yes, let's go!
SK0202,161,I'm working!
SK0202,162,I'd like to get to know you first.
SK0202,163,I'm working right now! I can't just leave!
SK0202,164,Besides, we've only just met.
SK0202,165,You're so cool, Mon Frère.
SK0202,166,Oh my, so uptight... I like you even more now.
SK0202,167,Er, what?
SK0202,168,I'd like to get to know you first...
SK0202,169,Are you for real? C'mon, Mon Frère, what are you saying?
SK0202,170,Get to know me? Mmmmm... OK, I'll tell you all about myself later.
SK0202,171,So how about we go someplace nice together?
SK0202,172,Er, um, well... I...
SK0202,173,No! Mon Frère is with me!!
SK0202,174,Oh my, I'm so sorry. I forgot all about you.
SK0202,175,...
SK0202,176,C'mon, say something, Mon Frère!
SK0202,177,S-Sorry. It was all so sudden... I don't know what to say.
SK0202,178,My, my... You're so innocent. And cute, too.
SK0202,179,Sure, let's go right now. I'd go anywhere with a beautiful lady like you!
SK0202,180,Mon Frère! We're getting ready for the welcome party!
SK0202,181,Oh dear. I must have offended your pretty little girlfriend there.
SK0202,182,That's too bad. Let's do this another time.
SK0202,183,Who are you, lady? Stop bothering Mon Frère!
SK0202,184,I'm sorry, sweetheart, I was just kidding.
SK0202,185,I'll see you around, "Mon Frère."
SK0202,186,What was with that lady? Everyone knows you're MY boyfriend!
SK0202,187,Huh... Just who was she, anyway?
SK0202,188,That woman from before, did she leave already?
SK0202,189,Come on, Mon Frère. What's so great about her, anyway?
SK0202,190,Y-You've got it all wrong, Iris. I was just wondering what she wanted.
SK0202,191,Now that you mention it, what WAS she doing here?
SK0202,192,That woman... What do you think she was here for?
SK0202,193,Was she the new member of the team?
SK0202,194,Was she a visitor?
SK0202,195,Was she a burglar?
SK0202,196,Was she the new member of the team?
SK0202,197,Was she a visitor?
SK0202,198,Was she a burglar?
SK0202,199,Was she the new member of the team?
SK0202,200,Was she a visitor?
SK0202,201,She was pretty, though, wasn't she?
SK0202,202,Perhaps that lady was our new team member?
SK0202,203,What!? You really think so?
SK0202,204,That was just a guess, but it's possible, isn't it?
SK0202,205,Hmmm, I'm starting to think so too.
SK0202,206,Maybe she was just a visitor?
SK0202,207,I think so too.
SK0202,208,She must have come to buy a photo or something.
SK0202,209,Could it be that she was a burglar?
SK0202,210,What?!
SK0202,211,M-Mon Frère... What if she really was a burglar? What do we do?
SK0202,212,On second thought, no thief would walk right in during the middle of the day.
SK0202,213,Y-Yeah, you're right! Whew, I was scared for a second.
SK0202,214,She was pretty, though, wasn't she?
SK0202,215,Mon Frère, you're my boyfriend, right?
SK0202,216,Don't go cheating on me!
SK0202,217,Oh, sorry. I shouldn't joke around so much.
SK0202,218,...
SK0202,219,What's wrong, Mon Frère? You got quiet all of a sudden.
SK0202,220,Oh, sorry. I was just thinking about who that girl was.
SK0202,221,Well, it's no use thinking about it too much. Let's go somewhere else.
SK0202,222,Yeah. Let's go, Mon Frère.
SK0202,223,That lady from before isn't here.
SK0202,224,What are you standing around here for, Mon Frère? Come onnnn, let's go!
SK0202,225,Ah... Sorry, I got sidetracked, didn't I?
SK0202,226,Hello, Yuri, Kasumi.
SK0202,227,Oh, Ogami! Have you heard?
SK0202,228,Yes, I have.
SK0202,229,...About what?
SK0202,230,About the new member, right? I just heard from the manager.
SK0202,231,What? You already know?
SK0202,232,Aww, it was a juicy story, too... Oh well.
SK0202,233,Heheh! Mon Frère beat you to it!
SK0202,234,...About what?
SK0202,235,Eheheh, well, you know...
SK0202,236,We're getting a new member for the troupe!
SK0202,237,Oh, you mean that? We're getting ready for the welcome party now.
SK0202,238,Oh my, you heard the news before Yuri.
SK0202,239,Oh gosh, you knew already? I thought I was the only one...
SK0202,240,Heheh, Mon Frère beat you to it!
SK0202,241,...
SK0202,242,I know! You mean the new girl, right?
SK0202,243,Oh gosh, even Iris knows?
SK0202,244,Aww, it was a juicy story, too... Oh well.
SK0202,245,Hahaha, that's too bad. We're preparing for the welcome party right now.
SK0202,246,So, everyone knew about it after all... You beat me this time.
SK0202,247,Hahaha, it's not the end of the world.
SK0202,248,You know her, she takes an awful lot of pride in her gossip.
SK0202,249,All right then, Ogami, do you want to hear about any other interesting rumors?
SK0202,250,Listen to a rumor.
SK0202,251,Tell them your business.
SK0202,252,Tell me some gossip.
SK0202,253,I'll come back later.
SK0202,254,So about the new member coming today...
SK0202,255,I hear she's a former member of the European Star Division, just like Orihime.
SK0202,256,Oh, if she used to be in the Star Division, that must mean she's an experienced pilot.
SK0202,257,I wonder what she's like? I'm getting excited just thinking about it!
SK0202,258,Ok, so listen, there's a new clerical worker coming to the theater.
SK0202,259,So she's going to work in this office with you two?
SK0202,260,No, the new person won't be working in the office.
SK0202,261,Huh? What do you mean?
SK0202,262,She's going to work as a secretary for Mr. Yoneda!
SK0202,263,Ogami, have you ever heard Orihime play the piano?
SK0202,264,I heard it the other day when I was passing the music room.
SK0202,265,Orihime's piano skills, they were so elegant and beautiful.
SK0202,266,I didn't expect that from her!
SK0202,267,Oh, Yuri. It's not unexpected at all.
SK0202,268,Orihime is a very nice, sensitive, and polite girl.
SK0202,269,Wh-Whaaaat?! Sensitive? Polite?
SK0202,270,...And very nice?
SK0202,271,That's right. Remember, Ogami, Orihime is still new to the theater...
SK0202,272,So please, try to take care of her.
SK0202,273,S-Sure...
SK0202,274,Oh, by the way, Ogami, I heard you got some communication device from Kohran. 
SK0202,275,Communication device? Oh, you mean the Cinematron.
SK0202,276,It's an amazing invention. You can actually see the other person's face while you're talking to them.
SK0202,277,Wow, that sounds great. Maybe I'll ask Kohran to make one for me.
SK0202,278,Kohran and I joined the troupe around the same time. I'd love to talk to her about the Hanayashiki Branch.
SK0202,279,Oh, Ogami, I hear that Orihime's been giving you a hard time. She really dislikes you.
SK0202,280,You must have done something to make her hate you, right?
SK0202,281,O-Of course not!
SK0202,282,Besides, Orihime says she hates all Japanese men.
SK0202,283,Huh... It sounds like she's got her reasons.
SK0202,284,Maybe she got rejected by a Japanese guy once. Yeah, that must be it!
SK0202,285,I wonder what kind of relationships she's had with Japanese men before getting here.
SK0202,286,Now, Yuri, you're assuming that she's been in a relationship with one, aren't you?
SK0202,287,Remember, Orihime is a bit younger than the other girls in the Flower Division.
SK0202,288,Oh, but age is just a number when it comes to love.
SK0202,289,I'm sure she's been rejected, and that's why she doesn't like Japanese men. Oh, poor thing...
SK0202,290,By the way, I read in this morning's issue of the Capital Daily Report...
SK0202,291,...that a large part of Tokyo Bay is going to be reclaimed.
SK0202,292,Oh, so there's more land for us to use.
SK0202,293,Wow, Kasumi, you read the newspaper? There's so many words in there.
SK0202,294,I only read fashion magazines...
SK0202,295,Well, nowadays, women are working in society just like men.
SK0202,296,You need to be more aware of current events, Yuri.
SK0202,297,Heheh, I already know what's going on in society from my magazines. I'll pass on the newspapers.
SK0202,298,Ogami, the renovations for the basement are finally done.  You can go down there, now.
SK0202,299,Oh yeah, Ogami, speaking of the basement, we also got a big bathroom now.
SK0202,300,Wow, that's great. I can rest and relax in there, now.
SK0202,301,Heehe, just don't peek on anyone in the bath, OK, Ogami?
SK0202,302,Iris, you seem happy to be with Ogami today, don't you?
SK0202,303,Uh-huh! That's because I'm his girlfriend!
SK0202,304,I see. You're a smooth one, aren't you, Ogami?
SK0202,305,Ogami and Iris, getting closer... Ooh, this is the best gossip I've had in ages!
SK0202,306,H-Hey, hey! Don't spread rumors like that all willy-nilly!
SK0202,307,It's OK, Mon Frère! It's the truth!
SK0202,308,Oh?
SK0202,309,Did you buy Maria's photo, Ogami?
SK0202,310,I figured I'd buy her photo since we're so far apart for now.
SK0202,311,Buying her photo because she's so far away? That's so sad!
SK0202,312,I know! I'll give you her contact number!
SK0202,313,Huh? R-Really?!
SK0202,314,Of course! You ready? Maria's number is "13900."
SK0202,315,If you dial 13900 on the Cinematron, you can talk to Maria.
SK0202,316,This is Maria we're talking about, so I don't think she's lonely or anything...
SK0202,317,But since you two are so far apart, why don't you show your face to her for a bit?
SK0202,318,I think I will. Thanks, Yuri.
SK0202,319,Oh?
SK0202,320,Ogami, you bought Kanna's photo, didn't you?
SK0202,321,I figured I'd buy her photo since we're so far apart for now.
SK0202,322,Right. The theater seems to have lost its pizzazz without Kanna.
SK0202,323,I know, Ogami, I'll tell you her contact number!
SK0202,324,Huh? R-Really?!
SK0202,325,Of course! You ready? Kanna's number is "14000."
SK0202,326,If you dial 14000 on the Cinematron, you can talk to Kanna.
SK0202,327,You do want to hear Kanna's cheerful voice, right, Ogami?
SK0202,328,Yeah, of course. Thanks, Yuri.
SK0202,329,Oh?
SK0202,330,You bought Sumire's photo, didn't you?
SK0202,331,Yeah. You know how Sumire's back at home for now?
SK0202,332,I figured I should at least get her photo, in the meantime.
SK0202,333,Wow, I didn't take you for a romantic, Ogami. I had no idea.
SK0202,334,No, no, that's not what I meant.
SK0202,335,Heehee, you don't have to be shy.
SK0202,336,Hey, I know, I'll give you Sumire's contact number!
SK0202,337,Huh? R-Really?!
SK0202,338,Of course! You ready? Sumire's number is "13800."
SK0202,339,If you dial 13800 on the Cinematron, you can get through to Sumire.
SK0202,340,Take your time, Ogami.
SK0202,341,All right, got it. Thank you, Yuri.
SK0202,342,More importantly, Sakura asked me to come get you guys.
SK0202,343,We're having a welcome party for the new recruit backstage at noon, so you all should come.
SK0202,344,Is that so? Thank you for coming all this way.
SK0202,345,We take our lunch break at noon, so we'll pay you all a visit then.
SK0202,346,I wonder what kind of person this newcomer is? Ohhhh, I can't wait for it to be noon!
SK0202,347,Well, we'll see you at 12 o'clock. Good luck with the rest of your work.
SK0202,348,See ya later! Bye-bye!
SK0202,349,I'll be back. Good luck with the rest of your work.
SK0202,350,Alrighty! Please do your best to prepare for the welcome party, you two.
SK0202,351,Yep! See you later, Auntie Yuri!
SK0202,352,Oh, Ogami. Is there something you need?
SK0202,353,If you want, I can tell you some interesting gossip.
SK0202,354,Oh Ogami. Thank you for preparing the welcome party.
SK0202,355,If you're asking about rumors, I'm all out. Sorry.
SK0202,356,I see. That's too bad.
SK0202,357,I'll have some more interesting tidbits for you some other time, so look forward to it!
SK0202,358,OK, don't forget to meet us backstage at noon.
SK0202,359,Yeah, we know. Come back soon.
SK0202,360,I'm sorry, I'm all out of things to gossip about.
SK0202,361,I see. That's too bad.
SK0202,362,I'll have some more interesting tidbits for you some other time, so look forward to it!
SK0202,363,Mr. Yoneda... I wonder if he's in?
SK0202,364,...I think we should go somewhere else.
SK0202,365,Oh, you're not going to see him?
SK0202,366,Uncle Yoneda isn't there, huh?
SK0202,367,Maybe he's still in the Command Room.
SK0202,368,It's Ogami.
SK0202,369,Sorry, can you come back later?
SK0202,370,...Yes, sir. Understood.
SK0202,371,Oh well. Come on, Mon Frère.
SK0202,372,It's Ogami. Mr. Yoneda, are you there?
SK0202,373,Ogami? Door's open.
SK0202,374,OK sir, I'm coming in.
SK0202,375,Uncle Yoneda, we're all getting ready for the welcome party.
SK0202,376,O-Oh, I see... That's great, Iris.
SK0202,377,...
SK0202,378,Uncle Yoneda?
SK0202,379,Mon Frère, I wonder what's wrong with Uncle Yoneda.
SK0202,380,He's not his usual cheerful self.
SK0202,381,Iris...
SK0202,382,Let's ask him why.
SK0202,383,You see, it's about that Yamazaki guy...
SK0202,384,Let's leave him be.
SK0202,385,He must not be doing well. Let's ask him what's wrong.
SK0202,386,OK...
SK0202,387,Mr. Yoneda. You're not looking so good, is something the matter?
SK0202,388,...What did you say?
SK0202,389,Did you bring Iris all the way here just to ask me that?
SK0202,390,I'm busy. If you don't need anything, then get out.
SK0202,391,Y-Yes, sir. Excuse me, sir.
SK0202,392,I think you made him mad, Mon Frère...
SK0202,393,I guess I shouldn't have asked...
SK0202,394,Oh well, can't do anything about that now. Let's go somewhere else.
SK0202,395,Well, Mr. Yoneda has been thinking about Yamazaki-
SK0202,396,Oy, Ogami! Not another word!
SK0202,397,I'm busy! If you don't need me, then get out!
SK0202,398,Oh... E-Excuse me, sir! I'll be going!
SK0202,399,I think you made him mad, Mon Frère...
SK0202,400,Let's go. There's no point in staying here.
SK0202,401,...Let's just leave him be, Iris.
SK0202,402,People can have a lot of things on their mind, you know?
SK0202,403,...OK, I get it.
SK0202,404,We're gonna go now, Uncle Yoneda...
SK0202,405,We're holding a welcome party for the new member at noon. You should come too.
SK0202,406,...Ah, right, right. Got it. Thanks, Iris.
SK0202,407,Well, Mr. Yoneda, if you'll excuse us.
SK0202,408,Come on, Iris. Let's go somewhere else.
SK0202,409,OK, Mon Frère.
SK0202,410,...
SK0202,411,Iris, we're still in the middle of getting the party ready, so let's get going.
SK0202,412,What? We just got here and now we're leaving?
SK0202,413,Yeah. Let's go.
SK0202,414,Well, Mr. Yoneda, if you'll excuse us.
SK0202,415,...Mhmm.
SK0202,416,You left without talking to him? That's weird.
SK0202,417,...It's all right, Iris.
SK0202,418,Come on, let's go. We don't have much time left before noon.
SK0202,419,Wow, there's always so many costumes in here.
SK0202,420,Hey, Mon Frère, it'd be so nice if they made a stage costume for you to wear.
SK0202,421,Hahaha, no way. I'm not an actor...
SK0202,422,Oh, Mon Frère, did you forget something? We were just here earlier.
SK0202,423,N-No... I just kinda wandered in here.
SK0202,424,We don't need anything here, so let's go.
SK0202,425,...There's no one here.
SK0202,426,There's no use staying here. Let's go to another room.
SK0202,427,Oh, it's Orihime! She's playing the piano.
SK0202,428,Hi, Orihime.
SK0202,429,...Oh, it's you. And Iris, too?
SK0202,430,How's it going with the party preparations?
SK0202,431,We're almost done.
SK0202,432,Hmm... I think it's going to take a little bit longer.
SK0202,433,Orihime, were you practicing the piano?
SK0202,434,I wasn't practicing. My technique is already perfect.
SK0202,435,I play the piano to enhance my imagination.
SK0202,436,Imagination is very important for acting on stage.
SK0202,437,That's so like you.
SK0202,438,Don't you ever practice your lines?
SK0202,439,I see, that's so like you, Orihime. I guess everyone has their own way of doing things.
SK0202,440,Oh, that's surprising, coming from you. That's exactly right.
SK0202,441,The best way to do anything is whichever way best suits you, that's what I think.
SK0202,442,That's why I don't see any point in practicing my lines, either.
SK0202,443,I see. You've got a point.
SK0202,444,So is that why you don't practice your lines?
SK0202,445,Yeah, it's important to practice!
SK0202,446,I'll practice my dance moves with everyone else, of course.
SK0202,447,But when it comes to enhancing my imagination, I do things my way.
SK0202,448,I think the best way to do anything is whichever way best suits you.
SK0202,449,That's why I don't see any point in practicing my lines, either.
SK0202,450,I see. You've got a point.
SK0202,451,It must be a hard concept for you to understand.
SK0202,452,...I've lost all my focus ever since you came in here.
SK0202,453,I'm out of here.
SK0202,454,Oh, Orihime!
SK0202,455,*sigh* She's gone.
SK0202,456,Sheesh. Orihime still marching to the beat of her own drum, eh?
SK0202,457,Nothing we can do about it. Let's go, Iris.
SK0202,458,OK!
SK0202,459,There's no one here.
SK0202,460,Let's go somewhere else.
SK0202,461,Ok, let's go, Mon Frère!
SK0202,462,Oh, Ogami, did you bring the plates from the kitchen?
SK0202,463,Oh... Sorry, not yet.
SK0202,464,C'mon, Mon Frère! Let's hurry up and get them.
SK0202,465,A-All right. I'm off, Sakura.
SK0202,466,Sakuraaa! We brought the plates!
SK0202,467,Thank you, Iris. Can you leave them there?
SK0202,468,Here you go!
SK0202,469,What do you plan on doing now, Ogami?
SK0202,470,I'll wait here.
SK0202,471,I've still got places to check out.
SK0202,472,I'll wait here. There's nothing else to do.
SK0202,473,Then I'll stay here, too!
SK0202,474,OK, we'll wait for the others to get back, then.
SK0202,475,I still need to check some other places out first.
SK0202,476,Ok, I understand. Just be back here by 12 o'clock.
SK0202,477,Yes, of course.
SK0202,478,I'll come along, too!
SK0202,479,Hahaha, all right, let's go, Iris.
SK0202,480,OK!
SK0202,481,Oh, Ogami, have you talked to Kasumi and Tsubaki, yet?
SK0202,482,Yes, I told them about the welcome party.
SK0202,483,Already taken care of, Sakura!
SK0202,484,Thank you very much! You saved me a lot of time.
SK0202,485,What do you plan on doing now, Ogami?
SK0202,486,I'll wait here.
SK0202,487,I've still got places to check out.
SK0202,488,I'll wait here. There's nothing else to do.
SK0202,489,Then I'll stay here, too!
SK0202,490,OK, we'll wait for the others to get back, then.
SK0202,491,I still need to check some other places out first.
SK0202,492,Ok, I understand. Just be back here by 12 o'clock.
SK0202,493,Yes, of course.
SK0202,494,I'll come along, too!
SK0202,495,Hahaha. All right, let's go, Iris.
SK0202,496,OK!
SK0202,497,Oh, Ogami, have you talked to Kasumi and Tsubaki yet?
SK0202,498,Oh... Sorry, not yet.
SK0202,499,We still have some time, so if you could please do that.
SK0202,500,Oh, Ogami, what's the matter?
SK0202,501,Nothing, I just thought everyone would be here by now.
SK0202,502,No, not yet. There's still time before the party, after all.
SK0202,503,If you need anything, please let me know.
SK0202,504,I see. Well then, Iris, shall we go?
SK0202,505,OK!
SK0202,506,Where is everybody? If they don't hurry, our new member will show up before them!
SK0202,507,We still have time, Iris, don't worry.
SK0202,508,I wonder if we got here too early?
SK0202,509,Oh, you're all here. Boy, you guys are fast.
SK0202,510,I thought I'd be the first one here, but wow, you're fast.
SK0202,511,It was all thanks to Ogami and Iris's help.
SK0202,512,Excuse us!
SK0202,513,Oh, everyone, welcome.
SK0202,514,Hurry up! Let's start the welcome party!
SK0202,515,Looks like everything's all ready.
SK0202,516,I thought I'd be the first one here, but wow, you're fast.
SK0202,517,It was all thanks to Ogami and Iris's help.
SK0202,518,...Nobody's here.
SK0202,519,We're not in the middle of a performance, so that's why there's no one here.
SK0202,520,Let's go, Iris.
SK0202,521,No one's here. Let's go somewhere else.
SK0202,522,Whoa, it's a mess back here, the set and the props are all scattered around.
SK0202,523,We'll have to clean up before our next performance...
SK0202,524,It's so messy, hide-and-seek would be really tough in this room.
SK0202,525,Well, it certainly does look like a storage room in here.
SK0202,526,I can't wait to see all the members of the Flower Division on this stage.
SK0202,527,We're putting on our summer performance next month, so don't you worry!
SK0202,528,The summer performance, huh? Can't wait.
SK0202,529,It's so sad seeing the stage so empty right now.
SK0202,530,...Let's go.
SK0202,531,It's so creepy to be in an empty auditorium like this.
SK0202,532,Aah! Mon Frère, behind you!
SK0202,533,HUH?! What is it!?
SK0202,534,Heheheh. Just kidding!
SK0202,535,D-Don't scare me like that, Iris.
SK0202,536,These seats will be filled with people once the show starts.
SK0202,537,OK, let's go.
SK0202,538,Ah, it's a beautiful day.
SK0202,539,Yep, being outside on a day like this is the greatest.
SK0202,540,Hmm, I agree. If I could, I'd take a nap out here.
SK0202,541,But we'd be late for the welcome party. Let's go, Iris.
SK0202,542,Ok, Mon Frère.
SK0202,543,Ah, it's so warm. It feels so good!
SK0202,544,I know, Mon Frère, let's take a nap!
SK0202,545,We can't, Iris. We'd end up late for the welcome party!
SK0202,546,Oh yeah. OK, let's go somewhere else, then!
SK0202,547,Oh, Mon Frère, let me see your watch!
SK0202,548,5 minutes to go until it's 12. The welcome party is about to start!
SK0202,549,It's that time already? OK, we need to rush back, then.
SK0202,550,Wooooow. From up here, I can see the street in front of the theater.
SK0202,551,I wonder if the new girl will be coming down that path.
SK0202,552,Hmm. We'll be able to see her from up here.
SK0202,553,Ooh! Hehehe, I've got a great idea!
SK0202,554,What's this great idea you got?
SK0202,555,That's. A. Secret! I'll tell you in a bit. Come on, let's go somewhere else.
SK0202,556,I hope the new girl will arrive soon. And then I...
SK0202,557,And then...?
SK0202,558,Hehehe. Still a secret!
SK0202,559,It's really quiet without a show being put on.
SK0202,560,There's no audience. I can't wait to do a play for them.
SK0202,561,There's won't be very many visitors this month. It's so quiet without them.
SK0202,562,No one seems to be here. Let's go.
SK0202,563,Ogami.
SK0202,564,Oh, Sakura. Did you find Orihime?
SK0202,565,Yes! I was on my way to the music room and bumped into her.
SK0202,566,It's thanks to your help I was able to find her.
SK0202,567,Really? That's great. Did Orihime help you out?
SK0202,568,Yes. I asked her, and she said "I understand."
SK0202,569,(I don't know. I feel like she's just saying that.)
SK0202,570,Well, I still have things to get ready, so gotta go.
SK0202,571,Hey, Mon Frère. Let's go somewhere else.
SK0202,572,OK, let's go.
SK0202,573,Well, she wasn't in the music room.
SK0202,574,I see. I'm sorry, I must have given you the wrong information...
SK0202,575,I'm still getting things ready, so I need to get going.
SK0202,576,Hey, Mon Frère. Let's go somewhere else.
SK0202,577,OK, let's go.
SK0202,578,Yes! Just a moment ago. We bumped into each other in front of her room.
SK0202,579,It's thanks to your help I was able to find her.
SK0202,580,Really? That's great. Did Orihime help you out?
SK0202,581,Yes. I asked her, and she said "I understand."
SK0202,582,(I don't know. I feel like she's just saying that.)
SK0202,583,Well, I still have things to get ready, so I gotta go.
SK0202,584,Hey, Mon Frère. Let's go somewhere else.
SK0202,585,OK, let's go.
SK0202,586,Well, she wasn't in her room...
SK0202,587,I see. I'm sorry, I must have given you the wrong information...
SK0202,588,I'm still getting things ready, so I need to get going.
SK0202,589,Hey, Mon Frère. Let's go somewhere else.
SK0202,590,OK, let's go.
SK0202,591,Yes, we bumped into each other in front of the stairs a moment ago.
SK0202,592,It's thanks to your help I was able to find her.
SK0202,593,Really? That's great. Did Orihime help you out?
SK0202,594,She actually got really upset when I said you told me she was in the attic.
SK0202,595,Did something happen?
SK0202,596,Orihime probably wanted you to keep it a secret.
SK0202,597,Ah, yeah... Oops.
SK0202,598,Well, I still have things to get ready, so I gotta go.
SK0202,599,Hey, Mon Frère. Let's go somewhere else.
SK0202,600,OK, let's go.
SK0202,601,Hmm, she wasn't in the attic.
SK0202,602,I see. I'm sorry, I must have given you the wrong information...
SK0202,603,I'm still getting things ready, so I need to get going.
SK0202,604,Hey, Mon Frère. Let's go somewhere else.
SK0202,605,OK, let's go.
SK0202,606,No... I couldn't find her.
SK0202,607,But, Orihime... She's helping out somewhere.
SK0202,608,(Hmm.... I sure hope she is.)
SK0202,609,Well, I still have things to get ready, so I gotta go.
SK0202,610,Hey, Mon Frère. Let's go somewhere else.
SK0202,611,OK, let's go.
SK0202,612,For once in Iris's life I'd like to see my performance from here.
SK0202,613,Hahaha... I see. But it's not so easy.
SK0202,614,There's no one here.
SK0202,615,Let's go to the other room, Iris.
SK0202,616,Yeah.
SK0202,617,Oh, Ogami.
SK0202,618,What's wrong, Sakura?
SK0202,619,Have you two seen Orihime?
SK0202,620,I thought I'd ask her for help, so I'm looking for her.
SK0202,621,She was in the music room.
SK0202,622,She was in her room.
SK0202,623,She was in the attic.
SK0202,624,If it's Orihime you need, I just saw her in the music room.
SK0202,625,I see. Thank you very much. I'll take a look.
SK0202,626,I think she was in the music room. Well... Maybe.
SK0202,627,I see. Thank you very much. I'll take a look.
SK0202,628,Orihime's in her room.
SK0202,629,I see. Thank you very much. I'll go look.
SK0202,630,I think she's in her room. Well... Maybe.
SK0202,631,I see. Thank you very much. I'll go look.
SK0202,632,Orihime's in the attic.
SK0202,633,I see. Thank you very much. I'll go look.
SK0202,634,I think she was in the attic. Well... Maybe.
SK0202,635,I see. Thank you very much. I'll go look.
SK0202,636,I'm sorry, I don't know where she is.
SK0202,637,I see. Thanks anyway. I'll go look for her some more.
SK0202,638,I should go, then. Keep it up, you two.
SK0202,639,Yeah. See you later.
SK0202,640,Nobody's here.
SK0202,641,Let's go somewhere else. We don't have much time before noon.
SK0202,642,Yeah! Come on, Mon Frère.
SK0202,643,I hate this room! I can't reach up there!
SK0202,644,Mon Frère, let's go to another room!
SK0202,645,O-OK, got it. Let's go, Iris.
SK0202,646,I thought Orihime might be here, but it doesn't look like it.
SK0202,647,Let's go somewhere else. We don't have much time before noon.
SK0202,648,Yay! It's Mon Frère's room!
SK0202,649,Hahaha. Come on in.
SK0202,650,Huh? What's that machine, Mon Frère?
SK0202,651,Oh, this? It's a communication device called the Cinematron.
SK0202,652,I can use it talk to people from far away.
SK0202,653,Wow, that's so cool! Hey, Mon Frère, let me see!
SK0202,654,Hey, Mon Frère, are you going to call someone?
SK0202,655,What should I do...
SK0202,656,Make a call.
SK0202,657,Maybe next time.
SK0202,658,OK, then. Let's do it.
SK0202,659,Yay! C'mon, hurry!
SK0202,660,We don't have much time. Let's do it another day.
SK0202,661,Boo... That's boring.
SK0202,662,Well, we shouldn't be playing around with this while Sakura and the others are getting ready, right?
SK0202,663,Oh, OK. I'll wait, then.
SK0202,664,That's good to hear, Iris. Let's go.
SK0202,665,...This was Ayame's room, wasn't it?
SK0202,666,We may never see Ayame again...
SK0202,667,But she'll always be in our hearts. Isn't that right, Iris?
SK0202,668,Yeah... That's right.
SK0202,669,All right, let's go. Ayame will get mad at us for looking so sad.
SK0202,670,Let's go, Iris. We've got other things to do now.
SK0202,671,There's no one here.
SK0202,672,There's no use staying here. Let's go to another room.
SK0202,673,Huh? Why is Orihime here?
SK0202,674,You're right. Orihime, what's wrong?
SK0202,675,Hey, Orihime! What are you doing?
SK0202,676,Eek!!
SK0202,677,W-What do you want from me?
SK0202,678,No, it's not like that...
SK0202,679,Hey, Orihime. What are you doing up here?
SK0202,680,I-It's none of your business. Why do you care?
SK0202,681,If you don't need me for anything, then I'll be leaving.
SK0202,682,Ah, Orihime! W-Wait!
SK0202,683,...She's gone.
SK0202,684,What was she doing up here, anyway?
SK0202,685,Hmm, I'm curious, but I don't think she's going to tell us.
SK0202,686,Anyway, let's go back downstairs. There's no point in staying up here.
SK0202,687,Orihime's gone. I wonder what she was doing just now.
SK0202,688,I don't know. Let's go back downstairs for now.
SK0202,689,What kind of books do you like, Iris?
SK0202,690,Well, I like books with lots of pretty pictures.
SK0202,691,Hahaha, I see. I'll read some to you later.
SK0202,692,Maria's always reading in here.
SK0202,693,That sure sounds like Maria. I'm sure she's reading a lot of books in New York.
SK0202,694,I wonder if this is the new girl's room.
SK0202,695,When Orihime came, she had so much stuff delivered to her room.
SK0202,696,Nothing seems to have come in today.
SK0202,697,Maybe she doesn't keep very many things in her room.
SK0202,698,There's no one here, yet, Mon Frère. Let's go.
SK0202,699,Yeah, I guess so. Let's go to aother room.
SK0202,700,I wonder if Sakura's in her room?
SK0202,701,(What a cute, girlish nameplate.)
SK0202,702,Hey, Mon Frère, aren't you supposed to be helping Sakura?
SK0202,703,Sakura's getting ready for the welcome party. I'm sure she wouldn't be in her room.
SK0202,704,Then we probably shouldn't have come here in the first place.
SK0202,705,Doesn't look like Sakura is here.
SK0202,706,She's been preparing for the welcome party. I guess she's not in her room.
SK0202,707,OK, we should get going, too.
SK0202,708,Kanna's gone to Okinawa for training. She's not here right now.
SK0202,709,But if Kanna was here, the preparations for the welcome party would have been over quick.
SK0202,710,Indeed... The hard work would have been done in no time.
SK0202,711,Kanna... I hope she'll come home soon.
SK0202,712,She'll be back in summer right? Summer's right around the corner.
SK0202,713,...Yeah, I guess so.
SK0202,714,Orihime... Is she in her room?
SK0202,715,This is Orihime's name plate.
SK0202,716,Hey, Mon Frère, did you need Orihime for something?
SK0202,717,No... I figured we probably shouldn't disturb her.
SK0202,718,Come on, Iris.
SK0202,719,...She's not here.
SK0202,720,Orihime said she was going somewhere, right?
SK0202,721,Hmmm, now that you mention it, that's right.
SK0202,722,Hey there, Orihime. I was just about to knock on your door.
SK0202,723,Ensign?
SK0202,724,I have nothing to talk to you about.
SK0202,725,I have stuff to do so I'll be off.
SK0202,726,Ah... Orihime!
SK0202,727,Orihime... She's gone.
SK0202,728,Oh, well... Let's go, Iris.
SK0202,729,...Who's there? Orihime's not here.
SK0202,730,Oh, she's still not home...
SK0202,731,Then who is this?
SK0202,732,Oh, she's still not home...
SK0202,733,Mon Frère! You just heard her, of course she's home!
SK0202,734,O-Oh, I see... You're right.
SK0202,735,Hmph! You must really be hopeless if even Iris is making fun of you.
SK0202,736,I can't believe you fell for that. You're pretty stupid, aren't you?
SK0202,737,S-Stupid?!
SK0202,738,*sigh* I still can't believe a guy like you is the captain of the Flower Division.
SK0202,739,Then, prepare for the welcome party.
SK0202,740,Ah, Orihime...
SK0202,741,Whose voice is that, then?
SK0202,742,You're in there, aren't you, Orihime? Open the door!
SK0202,743,...Ugh! You're so obnoxious!
SK0202,744,Ensign? Iris? What do you want?
SK0202,745,Orihime, you're in there, aren't you? Come on, open the door!
SK0202,746,Oh, is that you, Iris? Just a second...
SK0202,747,Ah! Ensign?! I thought Iris was alone!
SK0202,748,You're in there, aren't you, Orihime? You shouldn't pretend you're out when you're not.
SK0202,749,If there's anyone who'd fall for that trick, I'd like to meet him.
SK0202,750,That's right! Hey, Orihime. Let me see what's in your room.
SK0202,751,...My room?
SK0202,752,I still haven't seen what your room looks like! Can I? Please?
SK0202,753,Well, if you want to see it so badly, then I guess I don't have a choice.
SK0202,754,Fine, I'll let you see it, just this once.
SK0202,755,Yaaaay! Coming iiiin!
SK0202,756,Wowww... What a beautiful room!
SK0202,757,I understand why you'd be gawking at my room...
SK0202,758,But you can't stay here too long, so please leave before too long, OK?
SK0202,759,What's this...?
SK0202,760,It's an interior design that also serves as curtains.
SK0202,761,It uses the flag of a certain country as a motif. Do you know what flag, Ensign?
SK0202,762,It's the flag of France.
SK0202,763,It's the flag of Italy.
SK0202,764,It's the flag of England.
SK0202,765,It's the flag of France. Isn't it famous for the tricolor flag?
SK0202,766,Wrong! Japanese men really are stupid.
SK0202,767,It's based on the flag of my home country, Italy.
SK0202,768,Mon Frère. The French flag is blue, white, and red.
SK0202,769,R-Really? That was careless of me.
SK0202,770,It's the Italian flag. That's where you're from, right, Orihime?
SK0202,771,Well, you seem to know your stuff, despite being a Japanese man.
SK0202,772,That's Mon Frère for you! He's so smart.
SK0202,773,I'm pretty sure it's... the British flag, right?
SK0202,774,That's not it at all. Japanese men really are stupid.
SK0202,775,It's based on the flag of my home country, Italy.
SK0202,776,R-Really? That was careless of me.
SK0202,777,...Which flag is it?
SK0202,778,It's based on the flag of my home country, Italy.
SK0202,779,Frankly speaking, that sort of thing should be common knowledge.
SK0202,780,(Decorating with the curtains like this sure makes for an interesting layout.)
SK0202,781,(What a fancy-looking bed. Is that what Orihime sleeps on...?)
SK0202,782,Don't stare at people's beds like that!
SK0202,783,Oh... S-Sorry.
SK0202,784,How many times do I have to tell you?!
SK0202,785,You keep staring and staring and staring at my bed! You're so shameless!
SK0202,786,Get out of here!
SK0202,787,O-Orihime! Wait a minute...
SK0202,788,I'm not listening! Hurry up and get out!
SK0202,789,I knew letting a Japanese man into my room was a mistake. Now goodbye!
SK0202,790,Mon Frère... She kicked us out.
SK0202,791,Oh well. Let's go to another room.
SK0202,792,(A mirror stand, huh? There's some expensive cosmetics there.)
SK0202,793,Hey, Orihime! Teach me how to put on make up, too.
SK0202,794,I don't think there's any point for a child like Iris to wear makeup.
SK0202,795,HEYYY! I'm not a little kid!
SK0202,796,(There's a photo frame...)
SK0202,797,What's this picture?
SK0202,798,I can't show you this picture, Ensign.
SK0202,799,What? Why not? Let me see it, Orihime.
SK0202,800,No means no! Don't touch it!
SK0202,801,Pick it up
SK0202,802,(There's a beautiful woman in the picture...)
SK0202,803,Don't touch people's things without permission!
SK0202,804,Oh... I'm sorry. I just couldn't help myself.
SK0202,805,Seriously, the nerve of Japanese men! They really have no sense of decency!
SK0202,806,Get out of here!
SK0202,807,O-Orihime! Wait a minute...
SK0202,808,I'm not listening! Hurry up and get out!
SK0202,809,I knew letting a Japanese man into my room was a mistake. Now goodbye!
SK0202,810,Mon Frère... She kicked us out.
SK0202,811,Oh well. Let's go to another room.
SK0202,812,(No... I guess I'll give up)
SK0202,813,Aw... I wanted to see...
SK0202,814,(Seems she hates it so I guess I'll give up)
SK0202,815,(A landscape? Where is it from?)
SK0202,816,This is a landscape of my hometown.
SK0202,817,Huh, really?
SK0202,818,(I wonder what kind of place Orihime's hometown is?)
SK0202,819,Wow! What a pretty painting!
SK0202,820,You've got good taste if that picture caught your eye.
SK0202,821,This is a piece painted by Renoir.
SK0202,822,Renoir? Is that someone famous?
SK0202,823,He's a famous painter.
SK0202,824,By the way, Ensign, speaking of Renoir...
SK0202,825,Do you know what movement he belonged to?
SK0202,826,Impressionist, I think.
SK0202,827,Romanticist, I think.
SK0202,828,Direct style, of course!
SK0202,829,Impressionist, I think.
SK0202,830,Romanticist, I think.
SK0202,831,Uhh... Playful style?
SK0202,832,He was... An Impressionist, right?
SK0202,833,Wow, you're pretty knowledgeable.
SK0202,834,I have a tiiiiiiny bit more respect for you now, Ensign.
SK0202,835,You really know everything, Mon Frère!
SK0202,836,He was... A Romanticist, right?
SK0202,837,Wow, I'm surprised you know about that.
SK0202,838,But you're wrong. Renoir was an Impressionist.
SK0202,839,Oh... Is that right?
SK0202,840,Wow, there's stuff even you don't know, Mon Frère.
SK0202,841,Direct style, of course! A real hardliner, as all men should be!
SK0202,842,...Ensign? Do you even know what I'm asking about?
SK0202,843,Renoir was an impressionist. You really have no common sense at all, Ensign. Non ha senso!
SK0202,844,Uhhh... Playful style?
SK0202,845,Even if you were joking, Ensign, that's not funny.
SK0202,846,It's the only thing I could think of...
SK0202,847,Renoir was an impressionist. You really have no common sense at all, Ensign. Non ha senso!
SK0202,848,...Hmm. I don't know much about painting.
SK0202,849,I'll tell you, then. Renoir was what is called an Impressionist.
SK0202,850,You should study art some more, Ensign.
SK0202,851,(When I look at a good painting I just feel... so calm.)
SK0202,852,This luxury chandelier I brought is Italian-made!
SK0202,853,You brought that all the way from Italy? That's amazing.
SK0202,854,(Made in Italy... They sure make them different overseas.) 
SK0202,855,Iris, I think we should get going.
SK0202,856,Yeah, OK. Let's go, Mon Frère.
SK0202,857,Thank you for showing us your room. Maybe you can invite us over again sometime?
SK0202,858,Don't push your luck. Today was an exception because Iris was with you.
SK0202,859,Well then, I have things I need to do, so I'll be going.
SK0202,860,We should go, too, Iris.
SK0202,861,OK!
SK0202,862,Ensign... Are you just going to loiter around here or what?
SK0202,863,Right. We should get going, Iris.
SK0202,864,Yeah. Thanks for showing us your room, Orihime.
SK0202,865,You two should make a note of my immaculate taste for future reference.
SK0202,866,Thank you for showing us your room. Maybe you can invite us over again sometime?
SK0202,867,Don't push your luck. Today was an exception because Iris was with you.
SK0202,868,Well then, I have things I need to do, so I'll be going.
SK0202,869,We should go, too, Iris.
SK0202,870,OK!
SK0202,871,Maria's in America... That's so far away...
SK0202,872,Hey, Mon Frère, which is farther from here, France or America?
SK0202,873,Hmm. France might be farther, if we go by boat.
SK0202,874,Hmm... I hope Maria comes back soon.
SK0202,875,Yeah... Come on, Iris, let's go somewhere else.
SK0202,876,This is Maria's room. She's in America right now.
SK0202,877,There's no point in staying here. Let's go, Mon Frère.
SK0202,878,Hey, Mon Frère. Don't you wanna see my new room?
SK0202,879,Huh? Are you sure?
SK0202,880,Yeah! Come in!
SK0202,881,OK, I'll drop in. Just for a second, though, since we're still preparing for the welcoming party.
SK0202,882,Welcome to my room, Mon Frère!
SK0202,883,Hahaha, all right then, show me around a little.
SK0202,884,You sure have a lot of stuffed animals.
SK0202,885,Heh heh. They're all my dear friends!
SK0202,886,Wow, so they must all have names, huh?
SK0202,887,Of course they do! I'll introduce you.
SK0202,888,This is Anjou, and this is Lune, Paul, François...
SK0202,889,And this is, uh... Oh, that's right!
SK0202,890,I only just got this bunny, so he doesn't have a name yet.
SK0202,891,Can you give this one a name, Mon Frère?
SK0202,892,Hmmm... This is tough.
SK0202,893,What about Marie?
SK0202,894,How about Pierre?
SK0202,895,How about Hogehoge?
SK0202,896,How about "Marie"?
SK0202,897,What? That's a girl's name! This one's a boy!
SK0202,898,I played a girl named Marie on stage before!
SK0202,899,W-Well, it's cute, so that should still be fine, right?
SK0202,900,Y-You think so?
SK0202,901,Let's go with Marie, Iris.
SK0202,902,Hmmm... OK, then! I'll name him Marie!
SK0202,903,Well... How about "Pierre"?
SK0202,904,Wow! That's so cool! I'll go with that, Mon Frère!
SK0202,905,That's his name, then. Pierre!
SK0202,906,Thanks for giving him such a cool name, Mon Frère!
SK0202,907,Hmm... What about "Hogehoge"?
SK0202,908,Hogehoge? What does that mean? I have no idea!
SK0202,909,There isn't really a meaning. I just thought of it on the spot.
SK0202,910,I'll call him Hogehoge, then! It sounds funny.
SK0202,911,Starting today, you are Hogehoge. Nice to meet you, Hogehoge.
SK0202,912,Thanks for giving him such a funny name, Mon Frère!
SK0202,913,Hmm, I can't think of a good name...
SK0202,914,I know! I'll give him your name, "Ichiro"!
SK0202,915,Huh? I guess I don't mind, but...
SK0202,916,Yeah, of course! OK, his name will be Ichiro, then!
SK0202,917,You can properly introduce yourself the next time you come to my room.
SK0202,918,(Iris sure loves stuffed animals, huh?)
SK0202,919,That's a big chest of drawers. Is it all clothes in there?
SK0202,920,Yep, that's right. I love clothes.
SK0202,921,Heheh... Mon Frère. Which of my clothes do you like best?
SK0202,922,I like the one you're wearing now.
SK0202,923,I think I like your battle uniform.
SK0202,924,It's not the clothes that make a person attractive.
SK0202,925,I like the one you're wearing now.
SK0202,926,I think I like your battle uniform.
SK0202,927,I like your swimsuit.
SK0202,928,I like the one you're wearing now.
SK0202,929,I think I like your battle uniform.
SK0202,930,I'd rather you wear nothing at all...
SK0202,931,I like what you're wearing right now. It looks really good on you.
SK0202,932,Yeah! This is my favorite outfit, too.
SK0202,933,Thank you, Mon Frère! I'm so happy!
SK0202,934,I'd say your battle uniform. It's so cool and sleek.
SK0202,935,Thanks, Mon Frère. Eheheh, I'm so happy!
SK0202,936,Your battle suit is also really cool!
SK0202,937,Iris, a person's charm is not determined by their clothes.
SK0202,938,Hmm... I guess. Boring...
SK0202,939,I like swimsuits. I want to see you in a swimsuit.
SK0202,940,Huh?! That's bold of you, Mon Frère.
SK0202,941,OK then, I'll show you my swimsuit in the summer!
SK0202,942,I... I'd rather you wear nothing at all...
SK0202,943,Mon Frère, if you don't take this seriously, I'm gonna get mad!
SK0202,944,Oh... S-Sorry. Uhh... Which one's the best...
SK0202,945,Oh, never mind! You're such a perv, Mon Frère!
SK0202,946,...
SK0202,947,Oh, I get it! I look good in anything, so you don't know what to say, huh?
SK0202,948,Huh? I-I guess so.
SK0202,949,(So, Iris's various clothes are in here...)
SK0202,950,(Does Iris sleep together with Jean-Paul?)
SK0202,951,Iris, is Jean-Paul with you when you go to bed, too?
SK0202,952,Yep! Jean-Paul and I are always together.
SK0202,953,Even in the bath?
SK0202,954,Jean-Paul's a boy, so we can't take baths together.
SK0202,955,I-I see...
SK0202,956,(That's a huge pillow...)
SK0202,957,(That's a huge cushion...)
SK0202,958,That's a huge pillow. It looks so comfortable.
SK0202,959,That's called a "cushion", Mon Frère.
SK0202,960,Huh, really?
SK0202,961,(This looks like a picture of Iris's parents.)
SK0202,962,Hey Iris, what's this picture?
SK0202,963,That's my papa and mama.
SK0202,964,They told me to look at this picture whenever I feel lonely.
SK0202,965,That way I'm never lonely!
SK0202,966,I'm always with my papa and mama whenever I'm in this room.
SK0202,967,I see...
SK0202,968,(That's a nice smelling flower. I wonder what it's called?)
SK0202,969,This flower smells really nice. What's its name?
SK0202,970,Hmmm.... What's it called, again...?
SK0202,971,I'm sorry, I forgot. Orihime gave it to me. What was it called, anyway?
SK0202,972,Huh, Orihime gave you that flower? That's surprising.
SK0202,973,(I wonder how this curtain opens up.)
SK0202,974,How do you open this curtain?
SK0202,975,Oh, this? It lifts up, like a stage curtain.
SK0202,976,Wow... That's strange.
SK0202,977,(It's an unusual but stylish curtain.)
SK0202,978,We should get back to getting ready for the welcome party.
SK0202,979,Thanks for inviting me in, Iris.
SK0202,980,Sure! I hope you'll come again!
SK0202,981,Oh, is it that time already?
SK0202,982,Thanks for inviting me in, Iris.
SK0202,983,Sure! I hope you'll come again!
SK0202,984,We were just here, Mon Frère.
SK0202,985,We're preparing for the welcome party. Let's go somewhere else.
SK0202,986,...I guess so. Let's go, then.
SK0202,987,Kohran would definitely liven up the welcome party if she were here.
SK0202,988,She'd make some kind of new machine and make a big commotion.
SK0202,989,I'm tired of the explosions, though.
SK0202,990,Mon Frère, Kohran's not here cause she's at the Hanayashiki Branch.
SK0202,991,Oh, that's right. Totally slipped my mind.
SK0202,992,Sumire went back home, right?
SK0202,993,Yeah, but she said she'll be back soon.
SK0202,994,That's right. I'm sure it'll be even more lively around here once Sumire gets back.
SK0202,995,I hope Sumire comes back soon.
SK0202,996,Yeah. I hope the day comes soon where everyone in the Flower Division will be back together again.
SK0202,997,Oh, Mon Frère, let me see your watch!
SK0202,998,5 minutes to go until it's 12. The welcome party is about to start!
SK0202,999,It's that time already? OK, we need to rush back, then.
SK0202,1000,Are you still here, sir?
SK0202,1001,Ogami? Just the man I wanted to see. I've got a question for ya.
SK0202,1002,Sorry, Iris, but could you wait outside for a moment?
SK0202,1003,Huh? Boooriiiing. I'm staying right here!
SK0202,1004,Sorry, Iris. We won't be long.
SK0202,1005,Boo. All right.
SK0202,1006,What is it you wanted to ask me, sir?
SK0202,1007,Yamazaki attacked us specifically... And not just him, but that masked man, too.
SK0202,1008,You know what that means? To them, we're a thorn in their side.
SK0202,1009,Yeah. In order to bring chaos to the capital, they have to take out the Imperial Assault Troupe first.
SK0202,1010,Exactly. So, if it were up to you, what would you do to beat the enemy this time?
SK0202,1011,I'd attack the enemy's base.
SK0202,1012,I'd fortify the Imperial Theater's defenses.
SK0202,1013,I'd gather information on the enemy.
SK0202,1014,I would attack the enemy's base. A good offense is the best defense.
SK0202,1015,Oh? But we don't even know where they are. Where the hell do you plan on going?
SK0202,1016,Uh, well...
SK0202,1017,Remember this. There's no point in recklessly attacking.
SK0202,1018,Attack when the right opportunity comes. That way you'll achieve the greatest results with the least amount of force.
SK0202,1019,Yes, sir. I understand.
SK0202,1020,I'd fortify the theater's defenses. We don't know when the enemy will strike.
SK0202,1021,Oh? Even if the capital is reduced to ashes? What will we be defending then?
SK0202,1022,Uh, well...
SK0202,1023,Ogami, it's true that protecting the Imperial Theater is also important.
SK0202,1024,But our mission is to protect the capital. Never forget that.
SK0202,1025,...Yes, sir. I understand.
SK0202,1026,I'd gather information on the enemy. If you know your enemy and know yourself, you can fight a hundred battles without fear.
SK0202,1027,Oh? Really now? So where are you going to get this intel, and how?
SK0202,1028,Uh, well...
SK0202,1029,Gathering information is the foundation of strategy, but that's not the Flower Division's job.
SK0202,1030,The Imperial Assault Troupe has a secret intelligence unit called the Moon Division.
SK0202,1031,If we leave it up to them, we're bound to get some information sooner or later.
SK0202,1032,Ogami, I understand your frustration at not knowing who our enemy is, but you have to calm down.
SK0202,1033,...Yes, sir. I understand.
SK0202,1034,I don't know. So... I'd wait for now.
SK0202,1035,Oh, and then?
SK0202,1036,If we don't know who the enemy is, we can't make any move.
SK0202,1037,Heh, you're starting to understand what strategy is, aren't you?
SK0202,1038,For now, we have to patiently hold out for the right opportunity. 
SK0202,1039,...Yes, sir. I understand.
SK0202,1040,Wait for the right moment, look for the right opportunity, fight with all your spirit. Do that and you'll never lose.
SK0202,1041,Don't let the tragedy of losing your friends repeat itself...
SK0202,1042,...Yes, sir.
SK0202,1043,Well, I'm off. Say hi to Iris for me.
SK0202,1044,Manager Yoneda...
SK0202,1045,Hey, Mon Frère. Are you finished talking?
SK0202,1046,Uncle Yoneda was looking kinda sad. Is he OK?
SK0202,1047,It's OK, Iris, don't worry about it. All right, let's go.
SK0202,1048,Manager Yoneda... I guess he's not here anymore.
SK0202,1049,Let's go to another room, Mon Frère.
SK0202,1050,So this is the troupe's prized steam processor...
SK0202,1051,Uncle Yoneda said there are only two or three of them in Japan.
SK0202,1052,This and the command center next door are the heart of the Assault Troupe.
SK0202,1053,Even with this steam processor, we still don't know anything about our enemy, do we?
SK0202,1054,Demon King"... Who the hell is he?
SK0202,1055,This is... the infirmary, eh?
SK0202,1056,If you're injured, this is where you can get treated.
SK0202,1057,If you get hurt badly, you can go to the intensive care unit in the back.
SK0202,1058,But the ICU is usually off-limits.
SK0202,1059,I see... I'll keep that in mind.
SK0202,1060,I hate this disinfectant smell!
SK0202,1061,Hahaha. Let's go, then.
SK0202,1062,Look, Mon Frère. This is the new bathroom.
SK0202,1063,It used to be a shower room, but they rebuilt it and turned it into a bath.
SK0202,1064,Stretching your arms and legs out as you soak in the tub feels so revitalizing.
SK0202,1065,Yep! The tub's so big, it makes me want to go swimming in it!
SK0202,1066,Doesn't it make you wanna swim too, Mon Frère?
SK0202,1067,Well...
SK0202,1068,It makes me want to swim.
SK0202,1069,It makes me want to sing.
SK0202,1070,It makes me want to swim.
SK0202,1071,It makes me want to take a peek inside.
SK0202,1072,It makes me want to sing.
SK0202,1073,It's so big, it makes me want to swim, too.
SK0202,1074,You too, Mon Frère? Eheheh, we're on the same page!
SK0202,1075,But when I took a bath with Sakura the other day, she got mad at me for swimming.
SK0202,1076,She said "go in the pool next door if you want to swim."
SK0202,1077,I see... Yeah, that's true.
SK0202,1078,It makes me want to sing. It feels great to sing in the bath.
SK0202,1079,Uncle Yoneda sings a lot when he takes a bath, too.
SK0202,1080,Maybe I'll try singing next time?
SK0202,1081,It... makes me want to take a peek inside...
SK0202,1082,You're so gross, Mon Frère!
SK0202,1083,I hate it when you say that!
SK0202,1084,Oh... Kidding, just kidding. Don't be so mad, Iris.
SK0202,1085,I'm not really into swimming...
SK0202,1086,Nothing feels better than taking your time and washing yourself off in peace.
SK0202,1087,I always make sure to count to ten before I get out of the bath, too.
SK0202,1088,Hahaha, I see. If you don't warm up properly, you'll catch a cold.
SK0202,1089,I'll take a bath later. Let's go somewhere else, Mon Frère.
SK0202,1090,Yeah, you're right. Let's go.
SK0202,1091,There's still nobody in the bath, Mon Frère.
SK0202,1092,That's right. Let's go.
SK0202,1093,This is the changing room. This is where you change when you go to the pool or bath.
SK0202,1094,I see...
SK0202,1095,Don't peek in the bath, Mon Frère!
SK0202,1096,Why do you keep coming to the changing room?
SK0202,1097,You're not thinking of something nasty, are you?
SK0202,1098,No, not at all. I just happened to come here, that's all.
SK0202,1099,Look, Mon Frère! We got a new pool.
SK0202,1100,It's got warm water, too, so you can swim even in winter.
SK0202,1101,I heard it also has training mines!
SK0202,1102,I see... It's cutting edge, just as you'd expect from the troupe.
SK0202,1103,Do you like the pool, Iris?
SK0202,1104,Yeah, I love it! My feet don't reach the bottom, though, so I have to use a pool ring...
SK0202,1105,But I can swim halfway across the pool without one!
SK0202,1106,Wow, that's amazing. You're doing great, Iris.
SK0202,1107,Heheh, yep!
SK0202,1108,So this is the training room... Iris, you want to work out a bit?
SK0202,1109,Hmmm... Maybe later. We have the welcome party today.
SK0202,1110,You're right. We'll do this some other time.
SK0202,1111,We were just here, Mon Frère. Did you need something?
SK0202,1112,No... No, not really. Let's go, then.
SK0202,1113,Oh, it's Sakura.
SK0202,1114,Oh, Ogami, Iris.
SK0202,1115,What's up? What are you doing here?
SK0202,1116,I'm looking for some decorations for the welcome party.
SK0202,1117,I know, maybe you could help me?
SK0202,1118,Sure, no problem.
SK0202,1119,What a pain...
SK0202,1120,Searching through all this junk... What a pain...
SK0202,1121,...Fine, then. I'll look for it by myself.
SK0202,1122,You should've helped her, Mon Frère...
SK0202,1123,She looks so sad all by herself...
SK0202,1124,Sure, no problem. Right, Iris?
SK0202,1125,Yes! Let's do our best, Mon Frère!
SK0202,1126,Thank you! I appreciate it.
SK0202,1127,Let's help her out, Mon Frère.
SK0202,1128,...You're right. I should be moving, not standing around thinking.
SK0202,1129,Thank you. I appreciate it.
SK0202,1130,We're looking for a kusudama, Ogami. I appreciate your help!
SK0202,1131,OK, got it!
SK0202,1132,We're looking for a flower vase, Ogami. I appreciate your help!
SK0202,1133,OK, got it!
SK0202,1134,We're looking for a hanging banner, Ogami. I appreciate your help!
SK0202,1135,OK, got it!
SK0202,1136,We just looked there, Mon Frère!
SK0202,1137,We gotta search properly!
SK0202,1138,Did you see it there, Ogami?
SK0202,1139,Pull yourself together, Ogami!
SK0202,1140,Ah, that's it! Thank goodness we found it.
SK0202,1141,What's this? Oh, a kusudama.
SK0202,1142,Oh, Ogami! I was looking for a kusudama, too. All that's left is...
SK0202,1143,Ah, there you are! That's where you've been hiding.
SK0202,1144,A flower vase? That's not it.
SK0202,1145,I'm sorry, Ogami. I was actually looking for the vase, too.
SK0202,1146,Ah, that's it! Thank goodness we found it.
SK0202,1147,A hanging banner? Nope...
SK0202,1148,A banner? We'll need that, too.
SK0202,1149,I just looked in that box, Mon Frère.
SK0202,1150,...Props from "Dinosaur Island"? That takes me back.
SK0202,1151,What's this? Machine parts? Doesn't look like it's here.
SK0202,1152,I already checked here, Ogami.
SK0202,1153,What's this... A poster for "For Love"? That takes me back.
SK0202,1154,A Koubu part? Maybe it's inside... Nah, there's no way.
SK0202,1155,Maybe it's in the locker... Or not.
SK0202,1156,What's this room for? No good... It's locked.
SK0202,1157,Not here... Oh, what's this?
SK0202,1158,...
SK0202,1159,Hey, Mon Frère! What are you doing?
SK0202,1160,No slacking off!
SK0202,1161,We don't have time, Ogami... Please take this seriously.
SK0202,1162,S-Sorry. I got caught up in reading this...
SK0202,1163,We've looked so hard, and yet we still can't find what we need...
SK0202,1164,We've found a bunch of other stuff, too. Where haven't we looked yet?
SK0202,1165,I'll look around a bit more. I'll be fine on my own.
SK0202,1166,No, I'm sorry I couldn't be of more help.
SK0202,1167,Good luck, Sakura.
SK0202,1168,I can't believe we still couldn't find it...
SK0202,1169,Seriously... Where could it be?
SK0202,1170,I'll look for it a bit more.
SK0202,1171,I'm so sorry to have taken up your time.
SK0202,1172,No, I'm sorry I couldn't be of more help.
SK0202,1173,Good luck, Sakura.
SK0202,1174,Iris, Ogami. Thank you very much. You were a great help.
SK0202,1175,Nah, it was nothing.
SK0202,1176,That was fun, kinda like playing hide-and-seek.
SK0202,1177,I'll take these back to the dressing room. If you'll excuse me...
SK0202,1178,OK, Iris. We should go, too.
SK0202,1179,OK!
SK0202,1180,Iris, Ogami. Thank you very much.
SK0202,1181,Thanks to you, Ogami, we found everything I was looking for
SK0202,1182,You're amazing, Mon Frère! You're a genius at finding things!
SK0202,1183,I'll take these back to the dressing room. If you'll excuse me...
SK0202,1184,OK, Iris. We should go, too.
SK0202,1185,OK!
SK0202,1186,Oh, Ogami and Iris. I looked around a bit longer and I managed to find it.
SK0202,1187,Really? That's great, Sakura.
SK0202,1188,That's great, Sakura!
SK0202,1189,I'll take these back to the dressing room. If you'll excuse me...
SK0202,1190,OK, Iris. We should go, too.
SK0202,1191,OK!
SK0202,1192,Sakura, isn't here anymore. I wonder if she went back to her dressing room.
SK0202,1193,I'm sure she did. Let's go somewhere else too.
SK0202,1194,OK!
SK0202,1195,This is the hangar. My Koubu's kept in here, too.
SK0202,1196,Nobody would ever guess there's a facility like this below the Imperial Theater.
SK0202,1197,Hey, do you know what Orihime's spirit armor is called?
SK0202,1198,Orihime's Spirit Armor? I believe it was...
SK0202,1199,Eisenkleid.
SK0202,1200,Eisenkride.
SK0202,1201,Eisencloud.
SK0202,1202,Eisenkleid.
SK0202,1203,Bingo! You remembered! Just as I expected, Mon Frère!
SK0202,1204,I am the captain of the Flower Division, after all. It's only natural.
SK0202,1205,Eisenkride.
SK0202,1206,Close! It's "Kleid", not "Kride!"
SK0202,1207,Was that it? I have a hard time remembering foreign names.
SK0202,1208,Eisencloud.
SK0202,1209,Close! It's "Kleid", not "Cloud!"
SK0202,1210,Was that it? I have a hard time remembering foreign names.
SK0202,1211,...Huh? What was it called again?
SK0202,1212,Bzzt, time's up! Did you forget, Mon Frère?
SK0202,1213,Orihime's spirit armor is called an "Eisenkleid!"
SK0202,1214,W-Was that it? I have a hard time remembering foreign names.
SK0202,1215,I heard "Eisenkleid" means "Iron dress."
SK0202,1216,Orihime's been riding in it ever since she was in the Star Division.
SK0202,1217,Iron dress... What an interesting name.
SK0202,1218,My Koubu's yellow, just like my battle uniform.
SK0202,1219,Your white Koubu matches your uniform too, it's so cool.
SK0202,1220,Hahaha, thank you, Iris.
SK0202,1221,Oh, Mon Frère, let me see your watch!
SK0202,1222,5 minutes to go until it's 12. The welcome party is about to start!
SK0202,1223,It's that time already? OK, we need to rush back, then.
SK0202,1224,Wow... Amazing!
SK0202,1225,It looks like we're all set for the welcome party.
SK0202,1226,Hey, you're here.
SK0202,1227,We've been waiting for you.
SK0202,1228,Ogami, Iris, thank you for your hard work.
SK0202,1229,You too, Sakura. Thank you for the getting everything ready.
SK0202,1230,Heehee... I like doing this kind of preparation.
SK0202,1231,Besides, you all helped me...
SK0202,1232,It's all thanks to you. Thank you so much.
SK0202,1233,Oh, it was nothing, right Iris?
SK0202,1234,Yep! It was a lot of fun being with my Mon Frère!
SK0202,1235,Speaking of which, I asked you to bring some plates.
SK0202,1236,Yeah, I brought them with us. Sorry we're a little late with them.
SK0202,1237,Oh, you didn't forget. I'm glad.
SK0202,1238,It's a little late, but you were a big help. Thank you very much.
SK0202,1239,Oh, it was nothing, right Iris?
SK0202,1240,Yep! It was a lot of fun being with my Mon Frère!
SK0202,1241,Speaking of which, I asked you to bring some plates.
SK0202,1242,Ah?! Oh, that's right...
SK0202,1243,Huh!? You didn't bring them!?
SK0202,1244,Sorry... I totally forgot.
SK0202,1245,I forgot, too. I'm sorry, Sakura.
SK0202,1246,...Oh well. Everyone forgets sometimes.
SK0202,1247,I'll go get the plates. Now, everyone please come in.
SK0202,1248,Excuse us!
SK0202,1249,Oh, everyone, welcome.
SK0202,1250,Ogami and Iris asked us to stop by.
SK0202,1251,Thank you, Iris and Ogami!
SK0202,1252,You told them just like I asked, Ogami. Thank you.
SK0202,1253,Oh, it was nothing, right Iris?
SK0202,1254,Yep! It was a lot of fun being with my Mon Frère!
SK0202,1255,Excuse us!
SK0202,1256,Well, now... What beautiful decorations.
SK0202,1257,...Oh? What's wrong with Tsubaki?
SK0202,1258,Ah?! I forgot to tell Tsubaki!
SK0202,1259,Oh, really? Oh, no...
SK0202,1260,I forgot, too. I'm sorry, Sakura.
SK0202,1261,...OK, I'll go get her later.
SK0202,1262,We can all be forgetful sometimes. Don't worry about it.
SK0202,1263,...Thank you, Sakura. That's really nice of you to say. I appreciate it.
SK0202,1264,Excuse me. Wow, what beautiful decorations!
SK0202,1265,...Oh? Where are Kasumi and Yuri? Is something the matter with them?
SK0202,1266,Oh! I forgot to tell them!
SK0202,1267,Oh, really? Oh, no...
SK0202,1268,I forgot, too. I'm sorry, Sakura.
SK0202,1269,...OK, I'll go get them later.
SK0202,1270,We can all be forgetful sometimes. Don't worry about it.
SK0202,1271,...Thank you, Sakura. That's really nice of you to say. I appreciate it.
SK0202,1272,It's almost noon... Are Kasumi and the others not coming?
SK0202,1273,Ah... That's right, I totally forgot to tell them!
SK0202,1274,Huh!? Really?!
SK0202,1275,I forgot, too. I'm sorry, Sakura.
SK0202,1276,...OK, I'll go get them later.
SK0202,1277,We can all be forgetful sometimes...
SK0202,1278,But I can't believe you didn't tell any of them. You've got to get your act together, Ogami.
SK0202,1279,S-Sorry. I'll be careful from now on
SK0202,1280,Well then, all that's left now is to wait for them to show up.
SK0202,1281,I know! Why don't we greet them by the entrance?
SK0202,1282,That's a great idea. I'm sure our new member will be thrilled.
SK0202,1283,Yay! Let's go greet them, let's go!
SK0202,1284,Hmhm... So much noise for a simple newcomer.
SK0202,1285,I'll be waiting here. I'll leave it to you all to go greet them.
SK0202,1286,Understood. OK, let's go.
SK0202,1287,Hey, Mon Frère...
SK0202,1288,What's up, Iris?
SK0202,1289,Let's go to the terrace together to greet them!
SK0202,1290,If we shout "welcome" at them from up on the terrace, they'll be so surprised!
SK0202,1291,All right, let's go.
SK0202,1292,Let's greet them by the entrance.
SK0202,1293,...All right, let's go. I'm spending the whole day with you.
SK0202,1294,Yay! I get to be with my Mon Frère again!
SK0202,1295,You sure like hanging around Japanese men...
SK0202,1296,...OK then, the manager and I will wait by the entrance.
SK0202,1297,Thanks, I'll leave it to you.
SK0202,1298,OK, Mon Frère, let's hurry up and go!
SK0202,1299,Let's meet everyone at the door. I'll meet you at the door.
SK0202,1300,No! I want to be alone with you!
SK0202,1301,Sheesh, what's so great about Japanese men, anyway?
SK0202,1302,...Oh well. Iris won't budge once she has her mind set on it.
SK0202,1303,Ogami, please go with her.
SK0202,1304,The manager and I will greet them by the entrance.
SK0202,1305,Really? OK, I'll leave it to you.
SK0202,1306,Yay, it's decided! OK, let's go, Mon Frère!
SK0202,1307,Hmmm... What should I do?
SK0202,1308,C'mon, Mon Frère, let's go together!
SK0202,1309,Even if you say no, I'm taking you with me!
SK0202,1310,H-Hey, Iris! Don't pull so hard!
SK0202,1311,S-Sakura, greet them at the door for me!
SK0202,1312,O-OK, understood!
SK0202,1313,I'm sorry, Ogami, but each customer is only allowed to purchase one photo at a time.
SK0202,1314,I see. That's too bad.
SK0202,1315,Sorry, Ogami, but each customer is only allowed to purchase one photo at a time.

SK0203,2,A break in the clouds...? How do you break a cloud?
SK0203,3,It means to have a good change in the weather.
SK0203,4,This time of year is the rainy season in Japan, so we always appreciate a sunny day amidst the storms.

SK0203,10,Oh well. I guess we'll have to go meet them in the entryway.
SK0203,11,Oh, Sakura. Do you know where that Ogami got off to? I told him we had a new member coming in today.
SK0203,12,I think he's probably up on the second floor with Iris.
SK0203,13,I'll go and get him for you.
SK0203,14,Yaaay, they're here! What kind of person she is. I'm so excited!
SK0203,15,Mon Frère, I'm gonna go ahead!

SK0203,18,...Y-Yeah.
SK0203,19,Ah, good...

SK0203,21,... Yes.
SK0203,22,This is Reni Milchstraße, a former member of the Star Division like Orihime.
SK0203,23,I'm Ichiro Ogami, captain of the Flower Division. It's nice to meet you.
SK0203,24,... Likewise.
SK0203,25,Hee hee, I'm Iris! And this here is my best friend Jean-Paul. Please be nice to him!
SK0203,26,...
SK0203,27,At any rate, how surprising to have a boy as a new member of the troupe!
SK0203,28,For sure. So then, Reni...
SK0203,29,Let's work hard together!
SK0203,30,Not much of a talker?
SK0203,31,You're a part of the Flower Division starting today, so let's both work hard together.
SK0203,32,... Yes.
SK0203,33,You're... not much of a talker, are you?
SK0203,34,...
SK0203,35,S-Sorry. I suppose it's none of my business. I didn't offend you, did I?
SK0203,36,Not particularly...
SK0203,37,...
SK0203,38,...
SK0203,39,...
SK0203,40,...
SK0203,41,... Goodbye, then.
SK0203,42,H-Hang on! Where are you going, Reni?
SK0203,43,... I will be on standby in my room until receiving orders.
SK0203,44,Additionally, there is no need for you to associate so closely with me.
SK0203,45,Oh... Sure.
SK0203,46,Um, Reni? Actually, we've prepared a welcome party for you backstage.
SK0203,47,Would you like to come? We want to introduce you to everyone in the troupe.
SK0203,48,Let's go, Reni! Everyone's waiting!
SK0203,49,...
SK0203,50,What're you so quiet for? C'mon, let's gooo!
SK0203,51,Iris, Reni only just arrived, so I'm sure he doesn't know quite where to go yet.
SK0203,52,Come on, we'll show you the way there. Follow us.
SK0203,53,... Yes.
SK0203,54,Now then, these are your fellow Flower Division members.
SK0203,55,This is Orihime Soletta.
SK0203,56,Reni! Ciao! It's been a while!
SK0203,57,Yes.
SK0203,58,Oh, that's right, you two were originally in the Star Division together.
SK0203,59,These two are Kasumi Fujii and Yuri Sakakibara. They take care of office work.
SK0203,60,And this is Tsubaki Takamura, who runs the gift shop.
SK0203,61,... Likewise.
SK0203,62,Everyone, this is our newest addition to the Flower Division, Reni...
SK0203,63,Mihilstraße.
SK0203,64,Milchstraze.
SK0203,65,Milchstraße.
SK0203,66,Mihilstraße. Everyone, please be kind to him.
SK0203,67,Milchstraze. Everyone, please be kind to him.
SK0203,68,O-Ogami, Reni's last name is Milchstraße.
SK0203,69,You cannot even remember a person's name? Just like I thought, Ensign, you're even more uncouth than a monkey!
SK0203,70,I'm sorry, Reni. How rude of me to misremember your name...
SK0203,71,It's fine... A name is nothing more than a signifier.
SK0203,72,R-Right...
SK0203,73,Milchstraße. Everyone, please be kind to him.
SK0203,74,Er, wait... What was it?
SK0203,75,Ogami, it's Milchstraße.
SK0203,76,How crass you are, to forget someone's name! You have no tactful bones in your body!
SK0203,77,I'm sorry, Reni. How rude of me to forget your name...
SK0203,78,It's fine... A name is nothing more than a signifier.
SK0203,79,R-Right...
SK0203,80,If I recall, Reni was born in Germany.
SK0203,81,In German, "Milch" means "milk", and "straße" is "road"...
SK0203,82,So it means "Milky Way" like the galaxy, or "ama no gawa" in your Japanese.
SK0203,83,I see. What a lovely name.
SK0203,84,Well, it's quite a tongue-twister of a name, that. So why don't we just stick with Reni for now?
SK0203,85,... Yes.
SK0203,86,We've also got one more new person coming to work in the office with us.
SK0203,87,She was referred to us by the Army... Here, come on in. 
SK0203,88,Saki Kageyama, reporting for duty at the Grand Imperial Theater starting today.
SK0203,89,It's very nice to meet you all.
SK0203,90,Ah! You're the lady from before!
SK0203,91,Oh, you're...!
SK0203,92,Ah, it's you... Hmhm, we met earlier today, didn't we?
SK0203,93,I wanted to thank you for your kindness before. It left me with such a warm feeling in my heart.
SK0203,94,... You're pretty quick with the ladies, Ogami.
SK0203,95,Eep?! H-Hang on Sakura, this is just a misunderstanding!
SK0203,96,...I don't even want to know!
SK0203,97,(Oh man, what kind of weird ideas does she have about me now?)
SK0203,98,Ah, could it be that you're the Flower Division's captain, then?
SK0203,99,Y-Yes. Ichiro Ogami, captain of the Imperial Assault Troupe, Flower Division. Good to meet you.
SK0203,100,How gallant you seem. And far, far more handsome than I expected.
SK0203,101,It's nice to meet you, Ogami. I hope we get along well.
SK0203,102,Y-Yes, I hope we do.
SK0203,103,Goodness, Ogami. You certainly seem pleased with this, don't you?
SK0203,104,N-No, I... It's just your imagination, I swear.
SK0203,105,All right, that's enough stuffy introductions for now. Let's get the festivities going!
SK0203,106,And what was so stuffy about them?
SK0203,107,Don't you worry about that, now! This is a party! Everyone, let loose!
SK0203,108,Ahaha.
SK0203,109,Yaay! Yaay! It's a party, it's a party!
SK0203,110,Aww... So much for our party.
SK0203,111,What's this alarm?
SK0203,112,It's to warn us of an attack.
SK0203,113,This alarm is the Flower Division's cue to change from the Imperial Assault Troupe into the Imperial Assault Troop.
SK0203,114,Then what is the scope of our enemy? Location of appearance? What weaponry do they use?
SK0203,115,Huh? We don't know any of that just yet...
SK0203,116,R-Reni, where are you going?!
SK0203,117,Where is the Flower Division rendezvous point? Where is my Eisenkleid?
SK0203,118,Th-They're both in the basement. But first, we'll meet up in the tactics and command room.
SK0203,119,That is all I need to know. Going on ahead.
SK0203,120,Reni, hold on a minute!
SK0203,121,Ah... There he goes.
SK0203,122,Reni seems like a different person now, doesn't he-
SK0203,123,Hahaha. That's our Reni for you.
SK0203,124,The rest of us should get going too, Ogami.
SK0203,125,You're right. OK everyone, let's go!
SK0203,126,The Imperial Assault Troupe, Flower Division has assembled!
SK0203,127,Good. I see Reni arrived here particularly fast.
SK0203,128,More importantly Commander, do we know the enemy's location or number?
SK0203,129,The number of enemies is still unknown, but it seems they've appeared at a resort in Uguisudani.
SK0203,130,Uguisu... dani?
SK0203,131,Uguisudani is a neighborhood located in the northeastern part of the capital.
SK0203,132,According to reports, a great number of citizens, including children, are attempting to evacuate the area.
SK0203,133,Oh no! If we don't hurry, all those townspeople could become victims...
SK0203,134,Reni, I know it's pretty sudden to have to dispatch on a mission right after arriving here...
SK0203,135,... but please, lend us your strength! For the sake of the capital's citizens!
SK0203,136,...
SK0203,137,I have acknowledged that this battle's objective is to protect the citizens.
SK0203,138,However, when it comes to battle, the most critical objective remains to win.
SK0203,139,We should consider that our top priority.
SK0203,140,R-Reni...
SK0203,141,Ensign, the only thing that matters to Reni in a battle is winning or losing.
SK0203,142,Reni never brings human emotions into a battle...
SK0203,143,So even if you give the order to protect the citizens, I don't believe it will have much effect.
SK0203,144,I-I see.
SK0203,145,All right, Ogami, time to mobilize!
SK0203,146,The Soaring Whale is ready for departure.
SK0203,147,The "Soaring Whale"? Now, what could that be?
SK0203,148,It's a huuuge flying ship! It can hold a whole bunch of Koubu!
SK0203,149,Now, Ogami. I need you to decide on the strategy for this mission.
SK0203,150,If we focus on offense, the Soaring Whale will provide backup via air bombardment.
SK0203,151,If we focus on defense, the Soaring Whale can airdrop healing supplies for you.
SK0203,152,So, Ogami. What will we do?
SK0203,153,Let's focus our strategy on offense!
SK0203,154,Let's focus our strategy on defense!
SK0203,155,Let's focus our strategy on offense! I want to try and take out all the weaker enemies in one blow with a bombardment.
SK0203,156,All right, then. Leave the bombardment to us!
SK0203,157,Let's focus our strategy on defense! I want us to fight carefully using those healing supplies.
SK0203,158,All right, then. The Soaring Whale will be sure to airdrop those provisions for you.
SK0203,159,Ogami, please give the order to move out!
SK0203,160,Imperial Assault Troupe, move out!
SK0203,161,Reni, give it your all!
SK0203,162,Imperial Assault Troupe, move out! Our destination is Uguisudani!
SK0203,163,Understood.
SK0203,164,Everyone, give it your all!
SK0203,165,I'm going to do my best, too!
SK0203,166,I'm looking forward to seeing just how skilled this next foe will be!
SK0203,167,Reni, this may be your first battle with us, but give it your all!
SK0203,168,Captain, all I need you to do is provide me with precise orders.
SK0203,169,It would be best if you all tried not to distract me too much from the battle.
SK0203,170,R-Right...
SK0203,171,Ogami! Please stop standing there with your mouth hanging open and give the order to move out!
SK0203,172,Uh... R-Right.
SK0203,173,I-Imperial Assault Troupe, move out! Our destination is, uh... Where was it, again?
SK0203,174,...Captain. At this rate, we'll all be killed.
SK0203,175,Reni, you can find our Eisenkleids over this way.
SK0203,176,... I know. After their activation, I will remain on standby until stowage in the Soaring Whale is complete.
SK0203,177,All right Reni, Orihime! Eisenklieds, move out!

SK0205,1,Phew, a new member arrived today, and we fought a battle. This has been quite a day.
SK0205,2,(Hm? It seems like someone's here.)
SK0205,3,Um... It's Sakura. Is now a good time, Ogami?
SK0205,4,Sakura? The door's unlocked, so come in.
SK0205,5,All right. Pardon me.
SK0205,6,Nice work today. What did you need?
SK0205,7,It's about Reni's welcome party...
SK0205,8,It was interrupted partway through due to the Black Demon Society's attack.
SK0205,9,I thought perhaps we could continue the party in the salon.
SK0205,10,So I came to ask if you'd like to attend as well.
SK0205,11,Sure, let's go.
SK0205,12,What a pain...
SK0205,13,Sure, let's go. It'd be a shame if we never got to finish the party just because of that.
SK0205,14,Yes. I want to put on a proper welcome party for him.
SK0205,15,Then let's get going. Everyone else is already there.
SK0205,16,What a pain... We had the party earlier, isn't that good enough?
SK0205,17,Ogami, come on, don't you feel even a little bad for Reni?
SK0205,18,Just come with me. Everyone is already gathered in the salon.
SK0205,19,I-I get it. We're going, we're going.
SK0205,20,...
SK0205,21,I understand that you're tired, but don't you think you could come for Reni's sake? Please?
SK0205,22,All right. Let's head over.
SK0205,23,OK. Thanks so much.
SK0205,24,Thanks for waiting, everyone. Well then, let's continue the party.
SK0205,25,Yeah! I brought some sweets with me.
SK0205,26,Ah, these are cookies from Linz, is that not right? I will have one, thank you!
SK0205,27,Hey, Reni, you try one, too!
SK0205,28,...
SK0205,29,What do you think? Yummy, right?
SK0205,30,...It has little nutritional value.
SK0205,31,Th-That's Reni for you...
SK0205,32,How did you come upon these sweets, Iris?
SK0205,33,So, my papa sent them to me, along with a letter he wrote!
SK0205,34,Oh, so your parents sent them to you from France. I was just thinking how rare it is to see sweets like this.
SK0205,35,Yep! I love my papa a whole lot!
SK0205,36,...
SK0205,37,How wonderful, Iris.
SK0205,38,Who do you like more, your papa, or me?
SK0205,39,How wonderful, Iris.
SK0205,40,Who do you like more, your papa, or me?
SK0205,41,...Orihime?
SK0205,42,How wonderful, Iris. He sent you a letter, and even some sweets to go with it.
SK0205,43,Uh-huh! Whenever I read a letter from my papa, it really lifts my spirits!
SK0205,44,I bet your papa is waiting to get a letter from you, too.
SK0205,45,Yeah, I have to send a letter back to him!
SK0205,46,So Iris, who do you like more? Your papa, or me?
SK0205,47,Uhmm... Hmmm...
SK0205,48,Ogami, it's a little mean of you to tease her like that.
SK0205,49,Y-Yeah, you're right. Sorry, Iris.
SK0205,50,It's OK! I love both you and my papa a whoooole bunch!
SK0205,51,...Orihime, is something wrong? That look on your face...
SK0205,52,It is nothing. Nothing at all.
SK0205,53,A letter from your father, huh...
SK0205,54,(Oh, that's right, Sakura's father has already passed away.)
SK0205,55,Oh... Sorry, Sakura.
SK0205,56,Please, don't worry about it. I was just thinking about how nice it must be.
SK0205,57,I'm sorry, Iris. Now I'm the one pouring cold water on things...
SK0205,58,...
SK0205,59,My goodness, all you have blathered about this whole time has been "papa" this, "papa" that. How nonsensical!
SK0205,60,Huh?!
SK0205,61,Orihime?
SK0205,62,Hmph.
SK0205,63,Orihime...
SK0205,64,Apologize to Iris.
SK0205,65,Why are you so upset?
SK0205,66,Orihime, apologize to Iris.
SK0205,67,No matter how you look at it, you went too far.
SK0205,68,Ahh, enough of you! This is exactly why I hate Japanese men!
SK0205,69,If you think that acting so important and righteous will endear you to me, you are quite mistaken!
SK0205,70,Orihime...
SK0205,71,Why are you so upset? You seemed fine just a minute ago...
SK0205,72,Oh no, I am not particularly upset about anything at all.
SK0205,73,And anyway, I would rather not hear you making assumptions about my mood, Ensign!
SK0205,74,Orihime...
SK0205,75,Orihime, do you really need to speak like that?
SK0205,76,My my, what is so wrong with speaking one's mind?
SK0205,77,Orihime, what's gotten into you all of a sudden?
SK0205,78,Why, nothing much at all.
SK0205,79,I was simply thinking of how strange it is to be so over the moon about a letter from your papa.
SK0205,80,So what? It's normal, right? I've waited a long time for him to send me a letter!
SK0205,81,Iris, do you not hate being treated like a child?
SK0205,82,Enough of this silliness. I think you would be better off without hanging onto your parents.
SK0205,83,...
SK0205,84,It's because... 'Cause...
SK0205,85,I... I wanna... I wanna be with papa and mama!
SK0205,86,I... I hate all of you!!
SK0205,87,Whoaaaa!!
SK0205,88,Wh-What is this?!
SK0205,89,Oh no! Iris's powers...
SK0205,90,Iris, calm down!
SK0205,91,You don't know how I feel at all!
SK0205,92,I hate you, stupid Orihime!!
SK0205,93,Uwaahhhh!!
SK0205,94,Ogami, are you all right?
SK0205,95,Y-Yeah... I'm fine.
SK0205,96,Where's Iris?!
SK0205,97,She rushed out of the room by herself...
SK0205,98,What in the world was all of that?
SK0205,99,Spiritual power. And a tremendous one, at that.
SK0205,100,Yes, that's it exactly. The very same power that allows us to pilot the Koubu...
SK0205,101,When Iris gets too worked up, she has trouble controlling her powers.
SK0205,102,We had an incident in Asakusa a while back because of that.
SK0205,103,Ogami, let's go look for Iris.
SK0205,104,She must still be somewhere in the theater.
SK0205,105,Go search for Iris.
SK0205,106,Have a word with Orihime.
SK0205,107,All right, let's split up and search.
SK0205,108,Right!
SK0205,109,Orihime, what's going on? Ever since Iris spoke about her father's letter, you've been acting strange.
SK0205,110,I do not believe I said anything that was wrong.
SK0205,111,Everyone has different circumstances in life. Iris is no exception.
SK0205,112,Speak for yourself, Ensign. Do not talk to me as if you understand!
SK0205,113,Mamma mia, I cannot stand to deal with you any more!
SK0205,114,Ah, Orihime!
SK0205,115,Ogami, please go search for Iris. She must still be somewhere in the theater...
SK0205,116,Right.
SK0205,117,...
SK0205,118,Ogami, let's hurry. If we split up and search, I'm sure we'll find her.
SK0205,119,R-Right.

SK0205,163,... "" "" () - . , ! ? ?! !!
SK0206,1,It's locked, so she must be somewhere in the theater.
SK0206,2,She's not here. Where could she have gone?
SK0206,3,Ah, Ogami... Have you found Iris yet?
SK0206,4,No, not yet.
SK0206,5,I see.
SK0206,6,I wonder why she snapped like that.
SK0206,7,I do think Orihime went too far... 
SK0206,8,But it's not often you see Iris lose her temper that badly.
SK0206,9,She was in a good mood earlier today, too...
SK0206,10,Maybe she just happened to be in a bad mood.
SK0206,11,She was in a good mood earlier today, too...
SK0206,12,Maybe she just happened to be in a bad mood.
SK0206,13,Come to think of it, after the battle...
SK0206,14,She seemed to be in a good mood earlier when we were getting ready for the party.
SK0206,15,Yes. I wonder, what on earth could be the reason for it?
SK0206,16,Well, there's no point wondering about it until we can have a talk with her.
SK0206,17,Right. In that case, I'll try searching a bit more.
SK0206,18,Who knows? Maybe she just happened to be in a bad mood.
SK0206,19,Maybe so, but I feel like there must be some reason for it.
SK0206,20,Well, there's no point wondering about it until we can have a talk with her.
SK0206,21,Right. In that case, I'll try searching a bit more.
SK0206,22,Hang on... Come to think of it, after the battle...
SK0206,23,...Iris seemed kind of down.
SK0206,24,Oh... Now I remember! She went back ahead of the rest of us.
SK0206,25,When she caught sight of one of the families we rescued, she suddenly got quiet.
SK0206,26,Maybe that has something to do with what just happened here.
SK0206,27,I'm impressed you noticed a tiny detail like that, Ogami. I wouldn't expect any less from you.
SK0206,28,No, it's nothing more than a guess right now.
SK0206,29,Well, there's no point wondering about it until we can have a talk with her.
SK0206,30,Right! In that case, I'll try searching a bit more.
SK0206,31,What could've gotten Iris so upset...? I'm not sure, myself.
SK0206,32,Still, there's no point wondering about it until we can have a talk with her.
SK0206,33,...Yes, that's true.
SK0206,34,In that case, I'll try searching a bit more. I'll see you later.
SK0206,35,Looks like Iris isn't here...
SK0206,36,I guess Tsubaki already went home for the day.
SK0206,37,If she were still here, I could've gotten her help with the search...
SK0206,38,It's just like Tsubaki to keep everything tidied up like this.
SK0206,39,...Er, I guess now's not the time to stand around here being impressed. I better look for Iris.
SK0206,40,The dining hall is so lonely when no one's here eating.
SK0206,41,Iris isn't here, either. I'll try looking in another room.
SK0206,42,Not in here... Well, if she were here, we'd have found her already.
SK0206,43,Earlier, she and I were in here to look for some plates to use at the party...
SK0206,44,I wouldn't have thought I'd be back here later looking for her, instead.
SK0206,45,I wonder if Iris is hiding somewhere out of sight...
SK0206,46,Shoot, she's not here. Guess I better go check a different room.
SK0206,47,The door's locked tight. I doubt she'd have been able to get outside from here.
SK0206,48,Which means... She must still be inside the theater somewhere.
SK0206,49,The door's locked. No one's left the building since I was here last.
SK0206,50,That means Iris is somewhere inside the theater.
SK0206,51,Looks like Kasumi and Yuri already went home for the day.
SK0206,52,If Yuri were around, I bet I could ask her where to find Iris.
SK0206,53,Iris isn't here. I'll go check a different room.
SK0206,54,Mr. Yoneda... Wonder if he's still up.
SK0206,55,Though I doubt he knows anything about where Iris could be...
SK0206,56,I should get a move on and keep looking for her.
SK0206,57,Mr. Yoneda, do you have a moment?
SK0206,58,Snooooore, snooooore...
SK0206,59,Ah, sounds like he's asleep.
SK0206,60,Oh well. I'll check somewhere else.
SK0206,61,Mr. Yoneda, are you in? It's Ogami.
SK0206,62,Oh, Ogami. Come on in, it's not locked.
SK0206,63,Right. Pardon me.
SK0206,64,How about it, boy? Want a drink?
SK0206,65,I-I appreciate the offer, sir, but I'm in something of a hurry right now...
SK0206,66,Ehn? You're talking about Iris, I bet?
SK0206,67,Wait, how did you know that?
SK0206,68,Even the thickest of blockheads couldn't have missed all the commotion she made.
SK0206,69,I'm so sorry I let things get this far.
SK0206,70,She was in a good mood earlier today, so I can't imagine why this happened...
SK0206,71,Ogami, just because someone's outwardly cheerful doesn't always mean they feel the same way on the inside.
SK0206,72,Consider this. Why did she act so pleasant during the day?
SK0206,73,Why did she suddenly seem depressed when she saw that family after the battle...
SK0206,74,...and how are you going to handle this going forward? Think it all over carefully.
SK0206,75,Right...
SK0206,76,Now, I've said my piece, so you need to get a move on and go look for Iris.
SK0206,77,I'm sure wherever she is, she's waiting for you to come find her.
SK0206,78,Yes, sir.
SK0206,79,Think it over carefully, huh? Hmm...
SK0206,80,Iris isn't here. I thought for sure she would be.
SK0206,81,Guess I'll go somewhere else.
SK0206,82,No one here. Maybe I'll try another room.
SK0206,83,(Wait, isn't that Orihime?)
SK0206,84,(She's coming out of the costume room. What was she doing in there?)
SK0206,85,...
SK0206,86,Speak to Orihime.
SK0206,87,Watch her quietly.
SK0206,88,Speak to Orihime.
SK0206,89,Watch her quietly.
SK0206,90,Cover her eyes and ask "Guess who?"
SK0206,91,Hey, Orihime.
SK0206,92,Kyah!
SK0206,93,Oh, so it's you, Ensign. I ask you do not startle me like that.
SK0206,94,Orihime, what are you doing here?
SK0206,95,...
SK0206,96,(Huh, now she's peeking inside the backstage room.)
SK0206,97,(She's been going around, looking in different rooms for a while now.)
SK0206,98,...Who's there?!
SK0206,99,(Oh crap, she found me!!)
SK0206,100,E-Ensign?!
SK0206,101,How disgusting you are! Sneaking around and spying on people!
SK0206,102,You have not a single ounce of regret for peeking into the bath, do you, you human refuse!
SK0206,103,I-I'm sorry. That wasn't my intention...
SK0206,104,In any case, just what were you doing around here, Orihime?
SK0206,105,...
SK0206,106,(I know. Why don't I tease her a little?)
SK0206,107,Guess whooo?
SK0206,108,Kyaahhh!!
SK0206,109,E-Ensign! What do you think you are doing, jumping out of nowhere?!
SK0206,110,Do not be touching me with your grimy little hands!
SK0206,111,I didn't mean... It was just a joke...
SK0206,112,There is quite a difference between the good jokes and the bad!
SK0206,113,Japanese men are truly ignorant, uncultured, shameless swine!
SK0206,114,Ooh, I cannot stand to see your face any more! I am excusing myself!
SK0206,115,Ah... She's gone. Maybe I went a bit too far?
SK0206,116,In any case, just what in the world was she doing over here?
SK0206,117,(I'll try watching her quietly.)
SK0206,118,(Anyway, searching for Iris should come first.)
SK0206,119,Were you looking for Iris?
SK0206,120,Helping with the nighttime patrol?
SK0206,121,Were you, by any chance, looking for Iris?
SK0206,122,...N-Not at all.
SK0206,123,OK then, what were you doing?
SK0206,124,...Whatever I was doing is no business of yours, Ensign!
SK0206,125,Why do you not save your breath, and go search for Iris yourself?
SK0206,126,You're right. If I have time to be standing around chatting like this, I should be off looking for her.
SK0206,127,Still though, just what were you doing, Orihime?
SK0206,128,Were you, by any chance, helping with the nighttime patrol?
SK0206,129,I am not so cruel as to take your precious chores away from you, Ensign.
SK0206,130,If I did it in place of you, you really would be useless.
SK0206,131,U-Useless?
SK0206,132,If you have the time to stand around and shoot breezes with me, would it not be better to go look for Iris?
SK0206,133,I will be going now, if you please.
SK0206,134,You're right. If I have time to be standing around chatting like this, I should be off looking for her.
SK0206,135,Still though, just what were you doing, Orihime?
SK0206,136,I think whatever I was doing has nothing to do with you.
SK0206,137,And now I will be going, so do pardon me.
SK0206,138,I do wonder what she was up to...
SK0206,139,Iris, if you're in here, please come out and talk to me.
SK0206,140,...
SK0206,141,No response. I suppose she isn't in here, then.
SK0206,142,No one's in here, and nothing has changed since the last time I was here.
SK0206,143,Guess I'll go check a different room.
SK0206,144,No Iris here. Hmm, where could she have gotten to?
SK0206,145,Well, I've got to keep searching. I'll try going somewhere else.
SK0206,146,Yeah, doesn't look like she's in here. I'll try another room.
SK0206,147,Iris was so cheerful earlier today. I wonder what happened?
SK0206,148,Doesn't seem like she's in here, either... Time to try somewhere else.
SK0206,149,I've already tried looking here. I'd better go somewhere else.
SK0206,150,This is where I had that strange encounter with Saki when she cornered me earlier.
SK0206,151,And on top of that, Kayama turned up in here, too...
SK0206,152,What was Kayama doing at the theater, anyway?
SK0206,153,She's not here behind the stage, it looks like.
SK0206,154,And I don't see anyone when I look out at the audience seating from here, either.
SK0206,155,Guess she isn't here. Time to search another room.
SK0206,156,Iris! Come on out!
SK0206,157,Iris!!
SK0206,158,...
SK0206,159,No good. I guess she isn't here.
SK0206,160,I can't find her anywhere. Just where did she go?
SK0206,161,Maybe she could be hiding in the shade of this tree?
SK0206,162,...She's not here.
SK0206,163,And... not over here, either.
SK0206,164,I've searched the courtyard pretty thoroughly, so she must not be here.
SK0206,165,Maybe I'll try looking one more time.
SK0206,166,...
SK0206,167,...
SK0206,168,Yeah, she's not here. I guess she didn't go to the courtyard.
SK0206,169,(Oh, it's Reni. It looks like he doesn't realize I'm here.)
SK0206,170,(He went downstairs. What's he going to do in the basement?)
SK0206,171,It's already 11 o'clock. I wonder where Iris could've gone.
SK0206,172,Wait. Kayama said something earlier...
SK0206,173,I think it was... "try going to the attic."
SK0206,174,Well, what have I got to lose? Guess I'll try the attic.
SK0206,175,(Hmm? Reni?)
SK0206,176,(What could he be doing here?)
SK0206,177,Say something.
SK0206,178,Leave.
SK0206,179,Cover his eyes and ask "Guess who?"
SK0206,180,Hey, Reni. What're you doing -
SK0206,181,...!
SK0206,182,Uwaaahhhh!!
SK0206,183,Yeowch...
SK0206,184,...Captain?
SK0206,185,R-Reni...
SK0206,186,There's no need... to send me flying...
SK0206,187,...You should not approach me from behind.
SK0206,188,My body moved on its own, which is why I threw you aside.
SK0206,189,I... I see...
SK0206,190,Goodbye, then.
SK0206,191,Ah, Reni!
SK0206,192,...There he goes.
SK0206,193,Still, I can't believe he tossed me aside like a piece of paper.
SK0206,194,Where the heck did he learn a move like that?
SK0206,195,(He looks lost in thought.)
SK0206,196,(I should leave him alone. Besides, I need to look for Iris right now.)
SK0206,197,(I know. I'll try teasing him a little.)
SK0206,198,Guess...
SK0206,199,...!
SK0206,200,...Whooooo?!!
SK0206,201,Yeowch...
SK0206,202,...Captain?
SK0206,203,R-Reni...
SK0206,204,There's no need... to send me flying...
SK0206,205,...You should not approach me from behind.
SK0206,206,My body moved on its own, which is why I threw you aside.
SK0206,207,I... I see...
SK0206,208,Goodbye, then.
SK0206,209,Still, I can't believe he tossed me aside like a piece of paper.
SK0206,210,Where the heck did he learn a move like that?
SK0206,211,...
SK0206,212,Who is it?
SK0206,213,Um, sorry... It's me, Reni.
SK0206,214,...
SK0206,215,Did you... need something?
SK0206,216,Well, I'm searching for Iris, and I was wondering if you've happened to have seen her?
SK0206,217,...I don't know.
SK0206,218,Goodbye, then.
SK0206,219,Reni, wait!
SK0206,220,And he's already gone... Oh well. I should get going, too.
SK0206,221,Iris doesn't seem to be here, either.
SK0206,222,Hmm, where could she have gone...
SK0206,223,There's no one here. Guess I should check someplace else.
SK0206,224,There's no way she'd hide in a place with such a great view.
SK0206,225,Iris... Where in the world could you have gone?
SK0206,226,Yeah, she's not here. She doesn't seem to be on the terrace, either.
SK0206,227,Hmm... Where's another place she could have gone...
SK0206,228,Iris! Iris, are you here?
SK0206,229,...No response. I looked over all the seats, but it doesn't seem like she's here.
SK0206,230,She's definitely not here. I even looked in between all the seats.
SK0206,231,It doesn't look like she's anywhere in the first floor seating, either.
SK0206,232,I'll tidy up the flower vases and chairs.
SK0206,233,Ogami, please see to Iris.
SK0206,234,Got it. I'll leave this place to you.
SK0206,235,The flower vases and chairs have been neatly put away. It must be thanks to Sakura's hard work.
SK0206,236,It doesn't look like Iris came back here. Maybe I should try searching a different room.
SK0206,237,I thought she may have returned, but I guess I was off the mark.
SK0206,238,Iris... Where in the world did she go?
SK0206,239,She went rushing out of the salon, so it seems pretty unlikely that she'd be in here.
SK0206,240,It'd be nice if I had some idea of whether she was on the first or second floor, though...
SK0206,241,Yeah, she isn't here. I'll try looking in another room.
SK0206,242,Phew... Maybe I'll head back to my room for a minute and take a breather.
SK0206,243,All right... What should I do from here?
SK0206,244,Make a call.
SK0206,245,Go search for Iris.
SK0206,246,Maybe calling someone would be a nice change of pace.
SK0206,247,OK, I've powered on the Cinematron, so... I wonder who I should call?
SK0206,248,OK. I'll try calling someone.
SK0206,249,Hmm... I getcha.
SK0206,250,Essentially, I...
SK0206,251,But ya see...
SK0206,252,Hey, that sounds like Sumire.
SK0206,253,Whoa, Chief? I'm gabbin' a bit with Sumire right now.
SK0206,254,Perfect timing. How's about the three of us chat?
SK0206,255,Kohran's not picking up. Maybe she isn't near the Cinematron.
SK0206,256,Essentially, I...
SK0206,257,But ya see...
SK0206,258,Hey, is that Kohran?
SK0206,259,Oh my... Ensign, is that you?
SK0206,260,How lovely. Why not join in our little discussion?
SK0206,261,Yes, hello?
SK0206,262,Hey, Sumire. It's Ogami.
SK0206,263,Oh my, Ensign?! Allow me to switch over my screen. Would you wait just one moment?
SK0206,264,Now then, was there something you needed?
SK0206,265,Yes, hello?
SK0206,266,Oh, Sumire! So this was your number, then?
SK0206,267,Ah, Ensign?! Then you can hear me. How lovely.
SK0206,268,Could you wait for just one moment? I will switch over my screen.
SK0206,269,Now then, was there something you needed?
SK0206,270,Yeah, I wanted to talk a bit.
SK0206,271,I wanted to wish you goodnight.
SK0206,272,It's a prank call.
SK0206,273,Yeah, I wanted to talk for a bit, if that's OK...
SK0206,274,I do hope you'll forgive me Ensign, but I must change and be away to bed soon.
SK0206,275,The hour grows quite late, after all. Could our conversation perhaps wait until tomorrow?
SK0206,276,I see... Sorry.
SK0206,277,Well then, Ensign, I bid you goodnight.
SK0206,278,Yeah, I guess calling people so late at night was probably a bad idea.
SK0206,279,Well, I just wanted to wish you goodnight.
SK0206,280,Goodness, Ensign, you went to all that trouble to call me for such a thing?
SK0206,281,Even so, I am rather touched by your consideration for me. Thank you very much.
SK0206,282,Well then, Ensign, I bid you goodnight.
SK0206,283,Yeah, good night.
SK0206,284,Sumire...
SK0206,285,Well... It's a prank call.
SK0206,286,Ohohoho. But when speaking via the Cinematron, you can see the other person's face.
SK0206,287,Thus revealing the identity of the prank caller, and rendering it rather moot.
SK0206,288,Oh, good point. You're absolutely right.
SK0206,289,Now then, I must get changed and be off to bed.
SK0206,290,Good evening to you, Ensign.
SK0206,291,Hmm... Seems like it'll be pretty tough to prank someone with the Cinematron.
SK0206,292,...Ensign, do say something, if you would.
SK0206,293,It is somewhat rude to call someone and then stay silent, don't you think?
SK0206,294,Oh... Sorry, sorry.
SK0206,295,If there is nothing you need, I must be off to bed. Do pardon me.
SK0206,296,Ahh, shoot. I bungled that one.
SK0206,297,...Sumire's not answering. Maybe she's already in bed.
SK0206,298,Kohran and I were just discussing the Flower Division.
SK0206,299,You guys had a dustup with the Black Demon Society today over in Uguisudani, am I right?
SK0206,300,So how'd it go, anyways?
SK0206,301,It was a surprisingly easy win.
SK0206,302,It was a pretty tough fight.
SK0206,303,They managed to "mech" a mess of things...
SK0206,304,It was a surprisingly easy win. Our newest member, Reni, really pulled his weight out there.
SK0206,305,Wowee, he sure does sound promising! I was getting a bit worried about you all, but hearing that makes me feel better.
SK0206,306,Still... How disappointing to hear that victory came so easily even without us.
SK0206,307,Ah, don't get all down in the dumps, Sumire. The important thing is that they won, not how they did it.
SK0206,308,It was a pretty tough fight. I'm sure if you two had been here, we would've had an easier time of it.
SK0206,309,I would imagine so. Without me there, the Flower Division cannot display its true power, after all.
SK0206,310,Hoo-wee... Just as full of can-do as ever, eh Sumire?
SK0206,311,Still, if it's enough to make the Chief worry...
SK0206,312,...then it sounds like these guys are nothing to sneeze at.
SK0206,313,They really managed to "mech" a mess of things.
SK0206,314,Ahahaha! Aw Chief, you're such a hoot!
SK0206,315,Look at you makin' puns... How do you come up with this stuff?
SK0206,316,You got my joke, huh? Thanks, Kohran.
SK0206,317,...Really, now. You know, they do say that puns are the lowest form of joke.
SK0206,318,I do wish you had more of a highbrow sense of humor.
SK0206,319,R-Right...
SK0206,320,Well, we've only fought them once so far, so I can't exactly say for sure.
SK0206,321,Yup, I do suppose that's true.
SK0206,322,Anywho, it's gonna be a bit longer before Sumire and me come on back to the theater...
SK0206,323,...so you take good care of things until then, Chief.
SK0206,324,Ensign, I trust that you will eagerly await my return.
SK0206,325,Yeah, of course.
SK0206,326,Now then, I must take my leave. Ensign, Kohran, I bid you good evening.
SK0206,327,Alrighty. See ya later, then!
SK0206,328,I've still got some work to finish up, so I'm gonna duck out and burn the midnight oil a bit longer.
SK0206,329,I see. Keep up the good work, Kohran.
SK0206,330,Thanks much! Have a good night.
SK0206,331,The Black Demon Society... We definitely need to watch out for them.
SK0206,332,Now then, should I call someone else?
SK0206,333,Kanna's not picking up. Maybe she's not around?
SK0206,334,Uhm... Hello?
SK0206,335,Oh, Kanna!
SK0206,336,Boss?! What the...
SK0206,337,Uhm... Hello?
SK0206,338,Kanna?! Oh, so this was your number, then?
SK0206,339,Boss?! What the...
SK0206,340,Yaaawn...
SK0206,341,Were you asleep, Kanna? Sorry.
SK0206,342,Yeah... I hit the sack early today.
SK0206,343,Hang up.
SK0206,344,Apologize, then hang up.
SK0206,345,I guess it is getting pretty late, huh? I'll hang up.
SK0206,346,Hey, man. What the heck did ya want from me?
SK0206,347,Ah, whatever. I'm beat. Night, Boss.
SK0206,348,Sorry, I wanted to talk to you, so I gave you a call.
SK0206,349,I guess it is pretty late, so I'll let you go.
SK0206,350,I see... Well, thanks for takin' the time to call me.
SK0206,351,But I'm dead tired, so why don't we talk tomorrow instead?
SK0206,352,Yeah, sure thing.
SK0206,353,Yaaawn... Well, g'night, Boss.
SK0206,354,So, Boss... Did ya need me for somethin'?
SK0206,355,Well, uh... Nothing in particular. I just wanted to talk to you.
SK0206,356,C'mon Boss, gimme a break. You got any idea what time it is?
SK0206,357,How 'bout we talk tomorrow? I'm... about to pass out, here...
SK0206,358,S-Sure. It is getting late, so let's do that.
SK0206,359,Yaaawn... Well, g'night, Boss.
SK0206,360,Man, she was asleep and everything. I wish I hadn't done that.
SK0206,361,It's that late already... What now?
SK0206,362,...She's not picking up. She must be asleep by now.
SK0206,363,Oh, Captain. Good morning.
SK0206,364,Hey, Maria.
SK0206,365,Thank you for taking the time to call me all the way here in New York.
SK0206,366,Why don't we talk for a few minutes, then?
SK0206,367,Oh, Captain. Good morning.
SK0206,368,Maria?! Oh, so this was your number, then?
SK0206,369,Yes, that's right. So you went to the trouble of looking it up?
SK0206,370,Why don't we talk for a few minutes, then?
SK0206,371,You know, isn't it kind of strange to say "good morning" at this hour?
SK0206,372,Haha... There's a 10-hour time difference between the capital and New York.
SK0206,373,It may be nighttime over there, but it's morning in New York.
SK0206,374,Oh, I see...
SK0206,375,...
SK0206,376,Was there something you needed, Captain?
SK0206,377,You seem to have a rather bleak expression on your face...
SK0206,378,Talk about Iris.
SK0206,379,Talk about Orihime.
SK0206,380,Actually... Iris got all worked up and made a mess of the salon.
SK0206,381,Then she ran off to hide somewhere. I'm searching for her now.
SK0206,382,...Wait, what?
SK0206,383,She was so bubbly when I spoke with her this afternoon. So why...
SK0206,384,Well, I'm not too sure, either.
SK0206,385,If that's the case, why are you calling me like there's nothing else going on right now?!
SK0206,386,Um... I wanted to ask you for advice, Maria...
SK0206,387,Get it together, Captain. Iris is waiting for you to go and support her.
SK0206,388,Think long and hard about why she was clinging to you earlier today.
SK0206,389,...
SK0206,390,You need to go find her right now. Hurry it up!
SK0206,391,R-Right.
SK0206,392,Man, she really let me have it.
SK0206,393,We had a new member named Orihime join the Flower Division recently.
SK0206,394,She hardly listens to a thing I say. I'm not sure how to handle her.
SK0206,395,I haven't met this Orihime myself, so I can't say anything for certain. However...
SK0206,396,If you can make it clear to her that you're a captain who cares for his subordinates, I'm certain she'll come around.
SK0206,397,Have confidence in yourself, Captain. I have faith that you can do this.
SK0206,398,All right. I'll give it some more time.
SK0206,399,Well, I must be going.
SK0206,400,It may be morning here, but have a good night, Captain.
SK0206,401,I know what she said, but something tells me it won't be that easy.
SK0206,402,No... Nothing in particular.
SK0206,403,Really? Are you taking care not to do anything that would cause me undue worry?
SK0206,404,Yes, we're fine here. Don't worry about a thing, Maria. Just focus on doing your best in New York.
SK0206,405,I see. All right, then.
SK0206,406,Well, I must be going.
SK0206,407,It may be morning here, but have a good night, Captain.
SK0206,408,Maria... I certainly don't want to make her worry about us.
SK0206,409,I'll figure things out with Iris, for sure.
SK0206,410,...Hello?
SK0206,411,Maria? It's Ogami.
SK0206,412,Captain! Why aren't you looking for Iris?!
SK0206,413,Get off the line with me and go find her, right now!
SK0206,414,O-OK, I get it.
SK0206,415,I guess I ought to do as she says and keep looking...
SK0206,416,...Maria's not picking up.
SK0206,417,Guess I'll have to give up on it for now.
SK0206,418,Maria's not picking up.
SK0206,419,It's morning where she is now. She probably went to eat breakfast or something.
SK0206,420,Good evening. It's time for Capital News.
SK0206,421,Hex Mechs appeared shortly after noon today among a crowd of vacationers in Uguisudani.
SK0206,422,They engaged in combat with the Imperial Assault Troupe, who were dispatched to the scene.
SK0206,423,At the time of the incident, a number of sightseers who had come to view the wisterias were present at the scene.
SK0206,424,Now, we'll hear comments from some people who witnessed the Hex Mechs.
SK0206,425,Yeah, I was just laying back, taking in the flowers and enjoying some sake when those things showed up out of nowhere.
SK0206,426,Sheesh, it completely killed my buzz. How're they planning to make up for this, huh?
SK0206,427,...You can hear the anger in his voice.
SK0206,428,Thanks to the efforts of the Imperial Assault Troupe...
SK0206,429,...the incident was put to rest without any casualties.
SK0206,430,The unusual Spirit Armor sighted during last month's battle in Ginza...
SK0206,431,...appears of a similar type to the one which showed up in Uguisudani.
SK0206,432,The Ministry of Communications recently instated regular airmail service for the capital, Osaka, and Fukuoka regions.
SK0206,433,Hopes are high that this will enable faster delivery of mail over long distances...
SK0206,434,But, due to high costs, it will likely be utilized primarily by government agencies and businesses.
SK0206,435,It may take some time for this next-generation airmail service to be useful to the general public.
SK0206,436,Finally, it's time for this week's weather forecast.
SK0206,437,A high-pressure system will advance over the Sea of Japan this week, leading to more clear early summer skies.
SK0206,438,However, there is speculation that turnouts of vacationers to resorts will be reduced...
SK0206,439,...in no small part due to the incident with today's Hex Mech attack.
SK0206,440,That's it for Capital News, brought to you by the Capital Daily Report.
SK0206,441,That concludes today's broadcast. We hope you will look forward to tomorrow's programming.
SK0206,442,A red shadow opposes the evildoers lurking in the darkness of the capital. His name is Masked Red!
SK0206,443,Masked Red, the boy wonder of justice! Today he continues his fight for peace in the capital!
SK0206,444,Serial Radio Drama Masked Red, The Terrifying Mummy, Part 1
SK0206,445,On a hot summer's eve, a girl walks briskly down a gloomy, barren street.
SK0206,446,Oh no. I'm going to be late for my koto lesson..."
SK0206,447,She turns down a narrow alleyway, only to find a figure standing there.
SK0206,448,Suddenly a huge man looms over her, standing at least 2 meters tall.
SK0206,449,What's more, for reasons unknown he's wrapped head to toe in pale brown bandages.
SK0206,450,The mystery figure's eye seems to glint red, and a massive hand reaches down for the girl!
SK0206,451,Eeeek! Someone, help me!" she screams. Then, at that very moment...
SK0206,452,Stop right there!" calls a voice from atop a blazing red steam bike!
SK0206,453,Oh, it's Masked Red!"<br>"No need to worry, Miss, I'm here to help!"
SK0206,454,Masked Red leaps from his bike, looking dashing as his cape billows in the wind.
SK0206,455,Will our hero be able to rescue this damsel in distress?
SK0206,456,Fight on, Masked Red! You're our hero, Masked Red!<br>The End
SK0206,457,Go, Masked Red! Fight on, Masked Red! Tune in next time!
SK0206,458,This isn't the time to be making calls.
SK0206,459,I need to look for Iris.
SK0206,460,Iris... Where could she have gone?
SK0206,461,...Ogami.
SK0206,462,Hm? Am I getting a call?
SK0206,463,No, Ogami. I'm right here, behind you.
SK0206,464,S-Saki? What is it?
SK0206,465,Well you see, I wanted to speak to you alone.
SK0206,466,But perhaps not here... Could you please follow me?
SK0206,467,Shoot, it's already this late?!
SK0206,468,I don't have time to be doing this. I have to look for Iris!
SK0206,469,If I recall, Kayama said to try going to the attic.
SK0206,470,Well, what have I got to lose? Guess I'll try the attic.
SK0206,471,This isn't the time to be loafing around.
SK0206,472,Right now as I'm standing here, Iris is all by herself, feeling lonely.
SK0206,473,OK, let's go. Wait for me, Iris. I'm on my way now.
SK0206,474,Just where could Iris have gone?
SK0206,475,Ayame... What should I do at a time like this?
SK0206,476,Just where could Iris have gone?
SK0206,477,...
SK0206,478,...You're pathetic, Ogami. You're the captain, so you'd better act like it!
SK0206,479,Ayame would scold me for behaving this way.
SK0206,480,The library... Iris doesn't usually come in here.
SK0206,481,It's going to be a pain, but I guess I have no choice but to go room by room and check for her.
SK0206,482,Just as I thought, it doesn't look like she's come here. I'll try searching another room.
SK0206,483,I wonder if Reni is in here...
SK0206,484,Reni's nameplate. It's just his name written on a piece of paper.
SK0206,485,Such a bland, spartan nameplate. It's very much Reni's style, I guess.
SK0206,486,...No time to be loitering around. I need to find Iris.
SK0206,487,Looks like Reni isn't here.
SK0206,488,Who's there?
SK0206,489,It's Ogami. Mind if I come in?
SK0206,490,...Go ahead.
SK0206,491,Thanks. Sorry to intrude.
SK0206,492,Wow, this is one bleak-looking room.
SK0206,493,...
SK0206,494,Uh, sorry. I didn't mean any offense.
SK0206,495,It's fine...
SK0206,496,In any case, did you need me?
SK0206,497,Have you seen Iris?
SK0206,498,Tell me about yourself, Reni.
SK0206,499,Have you seen Iris? She ran off, and we can't find her anywhere.
SK0206,500,...That has nothing to do with me.
SK0206,501,What do you mean, "nothing to do with you"? Iris is your teammate, isn't she?
SK0206,502,Aren't you worried about her?
SK0206,503,We are nothing more than combatants.
SK0206,504,Emotions are unneeded in battle. On the battlefield, excessive emotion can lead one to make mistakes.
SK0206,505,Reni...
SK0206,506,That isn't true!
SK0206,507,You have a point...
SK0206,508,Reni, that isn't true!
SK0206,509,To the Flower Division, there's nothing more important than our comrades' feelings.
SK0206,510,There is no such thing as "excessive emotion"!
SK0206,511,...How can you make sound decisions when you're that worked up?
SK0206,512,Uh...
SK0206,513,Well, there's somewhere I must go.
SK0206,514,You have a point. Excessive emotion can be deadly on the battlefield.
SK0206,515,Just as I'd expect from you, Reni. I'm impressed.
SK0206,516,...I also believe it is necessary to take a cautious attitude and question things.
SK0206,517,Uh...
SK0206,518,Well, there's somewhere I must go.
SK0206,519,If you have no need of me, there's somewhere I must go.
SK0206,520,Since I'm here, why not tell me about yourself, Reni?
SK0206,521,...About myself?
SK0206,522,Tell me about Germany, or your childhood, anything like that.
SK0206,523,...I don't know.
SK0206,524,Huh?!
SK0206,525,I don't know, so I have nothing to tell you.
SK0206,526,If you don't need anything else, there's somewhere I must go.
SK0206,527,H-Hey Reni, wait a second!
SK0206,528,...Gone already. He's a quick one, that's for sure.
SK0206,529,But still, I wonder what he meant by "I don't know."
SK0206,530,If you have no need of me, there's somewhere I must go.
SK0206,531,H-Hey Reni, wait a second!
SK0206,532,...Gone already. He's a quick one, that's for sure.
SK0206,533,Reni and Iris both... I wonder where they went.
SK0206,534,...!
SK0206,535,Oh, Sakura!
SK0206,536,Are you... angry about what happened earlier?
SK0206,537,No, not really.
SK0206,538,Well, excuse me.
SK0206,539,Uh...
SK0206,540,Explain what happened.
SK0206,541,Force her to stop.
SK0206,542,Explain what happened.
SK0206,543,Sakura, you don't have to open the door, but please, just listen to me.
SK0206,544,Saki and I were in the prop room together because she was asking me for advice.
SK0206,545,I can't exactly tell you what we talked about, but there was nothing untoward about it.
SK0206,546,Then Saki slipped and fell, and I had to help her get back up.
SK0206,547,Nothing else happened. You've got to believe me on that.
SK0206,548,...I see. Ogami, you are a pretty serious person.
SK0206,549,Is that really true? You tend to be pretty insincere around other people, Ogami.
SK0206,550,H-Hey, wait...
SK0206,551,...I'm sorry. I really do believe you.
SK0206,552,You're not the sort of person to lie about anything.
SK0206,553,But... I don't think I can face you with an honest smile.
SK0206,554,Sakura...
SK0206,555,So, I can't open the door. I'm sorry, Ogami.
SK0206,556,But by tomorrow, I'm sure I'll be able to greet you with a smile again.
SK0206,557,...OK.
SK0206,558,Well, I'll be going. See you in the morning, Sakura.
SK0206,559,Yes. Sorry, Ogami.
SK0206,560,Sakura, just listen to me!
SK0206,561,Ogami! What do you think you're doing, grabbing my sleeve like that?!
SK0206,562,I want to tell you what really happened.
SK0206,563,Saki and I were in the prop room together because she was asking me for advice.
SK0206,564,I can't exactly tell you what we talked about, but there was nothing untoward about it.
SK0206,565,Then Saki slipped and fell, and I had to help her get back up.
SK0206,566,Nothing else happened. You've got to believe me on that.
SK0206,567,...
SK0206,568,...Thank you. I really do believe you, Ogami.
SK0206,569,But... I don't think I can face you with an honest smile.
SK0206,570,Sakura...
SK0206,571,So... please excuse me for today.
SK0206,572,By tomorrow, I'm sure I'll be able to show you a smile again.
SK0206,573,...OK.
SK0206,574,Then, I'll be going. See you... in the morning.
SK0206,575,...Yes.
SK0206,576,(I should probably leave her be for now...)
SK0206,577,Sakura, I'll be going.
SK0206,578,But let's talk again in the morning.
SK0206,579,...
SK0206,580,Goodbye, then.
SK0206,581,Sakura is in her room, but... I should leave her alone right now.
SK0206,582,I wonder if Sakura is there?
SK0206,583,Sakura's nameplate. It has a very girlish design.
SK0206,584,...No response. I guess she's not in.
SK0206,585,I guess she must be out looking for Iris, too.
SK0206,586,Guess I'll try a different room.
SK0206,587,Kanna's room is locked, so I can't go inside.
SK0206,588,I wonder, what would Kanna do if she were here?
SK0206,589,The door is locked. There's no way Iris could get in.
SK0206,590,Orihime... Is she in her room?
SK0206,591,Orihime's nameplate. It's simple, but sophisticated.
SK0206,592,Guess I'll try a different room.
SK0206,593,I guess Orihime isn't here.
SK0206,594,(I did speak with Orihime earlier. And besides, finding Iris takes priority.)
SK0206,595,Yes, who is it?
SK0206,596,It's Ogami. Do you have a minute, Orihime?
SK0206,597,...Could that be you, Ensign?
SK0206,598,I do not have a word of anything to say to you.
SK0206,599,It is time for me to sleep, so be off with you now, quickly!
SK0206,600,H-Hey, Orihime!
SK0206,601,...
SK0206,602,Orihime?!
SK0206,603,Man, turned away at the door... I give up.
SK0206,604,Oh well. I'll go try another room.
SK0206,605,How rude you are, to be showing up at this hour of the night!
SK0206,606,What in this world could you want from me?
SK0206,607,Did you perhaps come here to talk about what happened with Iris?
SK0206,608,...
SK0206,609,Ask how she's doing.
SK0206,610,Give her a warning.
SK0206,611,Orihime, is something the matter? Earlier, you got so angry all of a sudden.
SK0206,612,...There is nothing, particularly.
SK0206,613,It sure seemed like there was something, if you ask me.
SK0206,614,You call me out here, and only for this, Ensign?!
SK0206,615,Having this discussion with you is only a waste of my time. I will be excusing myself.
SK0206,616,Shoot... No good.
SK0206,617,Oh well. I should get back to searching for Iris.
SK0206,618,Orihime, I don't know why you suddenly got so upset.
SK0206,619,But you took things too far with the way you acted towards Iris today.
SK0206,620,All of us are members of the Flower Division. So...
SK0206,621,Ohh yes, I did think you would be saying something like that.
SK0206,622,All the time, I am getting better at knowing what you will be thinking.
SK0206,623,O-Orihime...
SK0206,624,I cannot just be playing make-believe like we are friends.
SK0206,625,And now I will be excusing myself. Good night!
SK0206,626,Hmm... I wonder if she understood what I was trying to say.
SK0206,627,Oh well. Right now, looking for Iris is more important.
SK0206,628,...
SK0206,629,What is it? You call me out here, only to stand here like this. How angry you make me!
SK0206,630,How rude for you to treat someone this way, when they come out of their way to speak to you.
SK0206,631,Go ahead and stand there forever then, with your mouth sealed shut!
SK0206,632,Shoot... No good.
SK0206,633,Oh well. I should go somewhere else and keep looking for Iris.
SK0206,634,If Maria were here right now, she would...
SK0206,635,No. This isn't the time to be weak-hearted.
SK0206,636,Somehow or another, I have to lend Iris my strength.
SK0206,637,The door is locked. There's no way Iris could get in.
SK0206,638,...The door's open. Maybe she's inside?
SK0206,639,Nope, she's not in here.
SK0206,640,I thought she might've closed herself away in her room, but it looks like I was wrong.
SK0206,641,OK, time to try looking somewhere else.
SK0206,642,Maybe she's come back to her room by now?
SK0206,643,Nope, she's not here.
SK0206,644,Oh well. Time to go try another room.
SK0206,645,I bet if Kohran were here, she'd have some handy little person-locator robot she could whip out.
SK0206,646,But I guess there's no point thinking about stuff like that. I should get going.
SK0206,647,The door is locked. There's no way Iris could get in.
SK0206,648,I don't think she'll be in Sumire's room. It's locked, after all.
SK0206,649,OK, time to go search a different room.
SK0206,650,The door is locked. There's no way Iris could get in.
SK0206,651,Iris isn't here. I thought she might be, but...
SK0206,652,Oh well. I'll go somewhere else for now.
SK0206,653,(Ah, there's Iris!)
SK0206,654,...
SK0206,655,Iris, if you stay here too long, you're going to catch cold.
SK0206,656,Oh, Mon Frère...
SK0206,657,You... You came looking for me?
SK0206,658,Of course. I just had a feeling I might find you here.
SK0206,659,Mon Frère, thank you...
SK0206,660,(Ah, there's Iris!)
SK0206,661,...
SK0206,662,Iris, if you stay here too long, you're going to catch cold.
SK0206,663,Oh, Mon Frère...
SK0206,664,You... You came looking for me?
SK0206,665,Yeah. Sorry it took me some time to come.
SK0206,666,It's OK... I'm happy you came to get me.
SK0206,667,...I'm sorry, Mon Frère.
SK0206,668,We went to all that trouble for Reni's party, and then I messed it up.
SK0206,669,It's OK, Iris. I'm sure Reni wasn't bothered by it.
SK0206,670,Orihime may have said some nasty things...
SK0206,671,...but I don't think she meant anything by it. You should try and forgive her.
SK0206,672,...OK.
SK0206,673,I think maybe... I got a little bit too angry.
SK0206,674,I see.
SK0206,675,It's getting pretty late. Come on, let's get you back to your room.
SK0206,676,...OK.
SK0206,677,Oh yeah, I have to write back to papa and mama.
SK0206,678,Wait, you're going to write them now? But it's already time for bed.
SK0206,679,...No, I want to write it today.
SK0206,680,Ooh! Mon Frère, why don't you write them a letter, too!
SK0206,681,Hang on a sec! I can't exactly write in French!
SK0206,682,That's OK! You just tell me what you wanna say.
SK0206,683,And then I'll write it down for you.
SK0206,684,I'm gonna go get changed, and then I'll come to your room! I'll be right there, so please wait for me!
SK0206,685,H-Hey, Iris!
SK0206,686,Oh boy. She rushed off looking completely thrilled.
SK0206,687,I guess there's no helping it. I may as well spend the rest of the evening with Iris.
SK0206,688,OK, I'd better start cleaning off my desk.
SK0206,689,It's Iris. Can I come in?
SK0206,690,Yeah, go ahead. It's not locked.
SK0206,691,Okaaay! Coming in now!
SK0206,692,Hee hee. Thanks for waiting, Mon Frère.
SK0206,693,It's already 11 o'clock. I wonder where Iris could've gone.
SK0206,694,Wait. Kayama said something earlier...
SK0206,695,I think it was... "try going to the attic."
SK0206,696,Well, what have I got to lose? Guess I'll try the attic.
SK0206,697,I'm not sure if Iris would come to a place like this, but it wouldn't hurt to check.
SK0206,698,Yeah, she isn't here. I'll try a different room.
SK0206,699,If another enemy appeared right now, it would be pretty bad. I need to find her, fast.
SK0206,700,Where could Iris be, I wonder, and why did she get so agitated all of a sudden?
SK0206,701,There's only a few of these processing machines in Japan but I doubt even a machine this advanced could help me now.
SK0206,702,If only I could think as clearly as a machine to find a solution...
SK0206,703,No, that's no good. People can get stronger precisely because we struggle.
SK0206,704,And right now, what I need to do is lend Iris my strength.
SK0206,705,She's not here, either.
SK0206,706,Just to be certain, I'll try checking all the way in the back of the intensive care room.
SK0206,707,This room is ordinarily off-limits. It seems pretty suspicious...
SK0206,708,...
SK0206,709,Nope. She's not in here, after all.
SK0206,710,Yeah, definitely not in here. And it seems there's no sign of anyone else having entered this room, either.
SK0206,711,Oh well. I'll go try another room.
SK0206,712,Hm? Is someone taking a bath?
SK0206,713,Maybe it's Iris...
SK0206,714,Huh? Those flashy clothes, aren't these Orihime's?!
SK0206,715,S-So then... Orihime is in there r-right now.
SK0206,716,My body is moving towards the bathroom on its own...
SK0206,717,Go back outside.
SK0206,718,Oh no, my body is moving towards the bathroom on its own...
SK0206,719,Ahhh. I'm surprised; Japanese bathrooms aren't all that bad.
SK0206,720,(Orihime is... in the b-bath.)
SK0206,721,...! Is someone there?!
SK0206,722,(Crap, did she see me?!)
SK0206,723,Make an excuse.
SK0206,724,Run away.
SK0206,725,Make an excuse.
SK0206,726,H-Hey, Orihime.
SK0206,727,E-Ensign?!
SK0206,728,Um, y-you see, there's a reason I'm here.
SK0206,729,Do not feed me your excuses! Have a taste of this bucket!!
SK0206,730,Yeeeowch!
SK0206,731,I'm leaving right now! Please don't throw another bucket at me! Uwahhh, help!!
SK0206,732,Mamma mia, coming into the bathroom when someone is bathing... Are you all right in the head, Ensign?
SK0206,733,I'm sorry...
SK0206,734,Ohh, and I had just washed away all my feelings of irritation. Now I'm even angrier than before!!
SK0206,735,From now on, I will make sure to lock you in your room before I enter the bath.
SK0206,736,Oh yes. Maybe even to be safe, I will tie some rope around you as well!
SK0206,737,H-Hey, wait...
SK0206,738,Anyway, the next time you peek, you will wish I was using a bath bucket.
SK0206,739,Sheesh... I know I brought it on myself, but that was awful.
SK0206,740,(I gotta get out of here before she sees me!)
SK0206,741,Phew... I think I got away before she realized I was there.
SK0206,742,If I'd been just a moment slower, I might not have made it. That was too close...
SK0206,743,Wh-Who's there? Ensign, it couldn't be you, could it?!
SK0206,744,O-Orihime... Um, I...
SK0206,745,Just get yourself out of here, right away!
SK0206,746,Uh, s-sorry. I'm leaving right now.
SK0206,747,Mamma mia, coming into the bathroom when someone is bathing... Are you all right in the head, Ensign?
SK0206,748,I-I'm sorry, I wasn't trying to peek in on you...
SK0206,749,When I realized someone was in there, I just panicked and froze up.
SK0206,750,It is easy enough to see from here if someone is in the bath.
SK0206,751,Ohh, and I had just washed away all my feelings of irritation. Now I'm even angrier than before!!
SK0206,752,From now on, I will make sure to lock you in your room before I enter the bath.
SK0206,753,Oh yes. Maybe even to be safe, I will tie some rope around you as well!
SK0206,754,H-Hey, wait...
SK0206,755,Anyway, do not expect to be let off so easy the next time you peek.
SK0206,756,Sheesh... I know I brought it on myself, but that was awful.
SK0206,757,(I'd better get out of here before Orihime sees me.)
SK0206,758,...Looks like I got out without her realizing.
SK0206,759,If Orihime ever found me here like this, she'd never forgive me for it.
SK0206,760,I should get going. It doesn't look like Iris is in here, anyway.
SK0206,761,Ahh... I think it's about time I got out.
SK0206,762,(Oh crap!! It looks like she's getting out of the water!)
SK0206,763,(I gotta get out of here before she sees me!)
SK0206,764,Phew... I think I got away before she realized I was there.
SK0206,765,If I'd been just a moment slower, I might not have made it. That was too close...
SK0206,766,Ah, Ensign.
SK0206,767,H-Hey, Orihime. Were you taking a bath?
SK0206,768,Why, yes. I just got out.
SK0206,769,You would not happen to have been peeking inside, were you?
SK0206,770,When I was in the bath, I had a sense that someone was close by.
SK0206,771,N-No... Must've been your imagination.
SK0206,772,How very strange. I would have sworn that someone was in there.
SK0206,773,So, what do you think of Japanese baths?
SK0206,774,It wasn't as bad as I thought it would be, even if the picture of Mt. Fuji on the wall is nothing in the way of style.
SK0206,775,But my feelings of irritation have all washed away. I feel very refreshed.
SK0206,776,I will be going now, if you please.
SK0206,777,(Thank goodness, looks like she didn't notice anything.)
SK0206,778,OK, I should get back to searching for Iris.
SK0206,779,Looks like there's no one here.
SK0206,780,The bathroom seems to be totally empty. I should check somewhere else.
SK0206,781,Orihime was in here just a little while ago. It smells nice.
SK0206,782,...No, now's not the time for that. I need to keep looking for Iris.
SK0206,783,This soap smells really nice. I wonder who was using it?
SK0206,784,Well, it looks like no one's in here right now. I'd better look elsewhere.
SK0206,785,Maybe I should take a break and swim in the pool.
SK0206,786,She isn't here. Hmm... But where could she be, then?
SK0206,787,Doesn't seem to be anyone at the pool.
SK0206,788,Guess I'll go somewhere else.
SK0206,789,I doubt Iris would go someplace like this while she's upset.
SK0206,790,Hmm... Then, where WOULD she go?
SK0206,791,I'm back here again.
SK0206,792,There's no way Iris would be here. I must be pretty out of it.
SK0206,793,I really don't think she'd be in a place like this.
SK0206,794,I guess I'll go check another room.
SK0206,795,It doesn't seem like anyone's been in here at all, so I doubt Iris has, either.
SK0206,796,I guess no one's here. Oh well, I'll go try another room.
SK0206,797,Oh, looks like Reni is over there.
SK0206,798,Hey, Reni! What are you up to?
SK0206,799,...Captain.
SK0206,800,I am inspecting my Eisenkleid.
SK0206,801,I see, so you came here to check up on it after today's battle.
SK0206,802,You're pretty diligent about these things, aren't you?
SK0206,803,...
SK0206,804,Reni...
SK0206,805,Keep talking.
SK0206,806,Get out of his way.
SK0206,807,(I don't really have much to talk about.)
SK0206,808,(Oh, I know. I'll try asking him about machines.)
SK0206,809,Reni, do you like machines, by any chance?
SK0206,810,...Like?
SK0206,811,Yeah, like. Or, you know, have a fondness for?
SK0206,812,...
SK0206,813,...If nothing else, they make more sense to me than people. They are not ruled by emotions.
SK0206,814,I need to continue my inspection, so I'll be going.
SK0206,815,Good grief, he's just as blunt as ever.
SK0206,816,But I think I understand him a little better. It seems as though he doesn't dislike machines, at least.
SK0206,817,Well, take it easy, then. I'll bet you feel more at ease when you're alone, huh?
SK0206,818,...That is true.
SK0206,819,I need to continue my inspection, so I'll be going.
SK0206,820,Well, I guess I should go look for Iris, myself.
SK0206,821,If you have no need of me, I'll be going.
SK0206,822,H-Hey, Reni! Hold on a minute!
SK0206,823,...There he goes. Man, I couldn't really strike up a conversation with him at all.
SK0206,824,It looks like Reni is still performing his inspection.
SK0206,825,I should get back to searching for Iris, myself.
SK0206,826,(I wonder where Reni went off to.)
SK0206,827,(Looks like he went back downstairs. Is he headed for the hangar?)
SK0206,828,It's already 11 o'clock. I wonder where Iris could've gone.
SK0206,829,Wait. Kayama said something earlier...
SK0206,830,I think it was... "try going to the attic."
SK0206,831,Well, what have I got to lose? Guess I'll try the attic.
SK0206,832,Ogami...
SK0206,833,Hm?
SK0206,834,Oh, Saki. Did you need something?
SK0206,835,Well you see, I wanted to speak to you alone.
SK0206,836,But perhaps not here... Could you please follow me?
SK0206,837,Sure, no problem.
SK0206,838,I'm busy right now.
SK0206,839,Sure, no problem. I'll go wherever you'd like.
SK0206,840,Thank you ever so much. Well then, if you'd please follow me.
SK0206,841,I'm busy right now. Iris disappeared somewhere, so I'm trying to find her.
SK0206,842,I see, so Iris is more important to you than I am...
SK0206,843,H-Hey, that's not what I said.
SK0206,844,Then, you'll listen to what I have to say? Thank you, Ogami!
SK0206,845,Let's go, then. There are so many things I'd like to discuss, just you and me.
SK0206,846,H-Hey, Saki! Don't just drag me around like this!
SK0206,847,Hmhmhm... Follow me, if you would.
SK0206,848,Hmmm, what should I do?
SK0206,849,If you have the time to think about it, I'd like for you to hear me out.
SK0206,850,Let's go, then. There are so many things I'd like to discuss, just you and me.
SK0206,851,H-Hey, Saki! Don't just drag me around like this!
SK0206,852,Hmhmhm... Follow me, if you would.
SK0206,853,This is... the prop room. What in the world did you want to discuss in here?
SK0206,854,Ogami...
SK0206,855,Iris doesn't seem to be here, either.
SK0206,856,I wonder where she could've gone.
SK0206,857,Ogami...
SK0206,858,Hm?
SK0206,859,Oh, Saki. Did you need something?
SK0206,860,Ogami...
SK0206,861,Please... Hold me...
SK0206,862,Eeep?!
SK0206,863,S-Saki, where did this come from all of a sudden?
SK0206,864,I'm so clueless about everything when it comes to working at this theater. The anxiety is too much.
SK0206,865,Please, Ogami, don't say anything more. Just hold me...
SK0206,866,Hold her.
SK0206,867,Refuse.
SK0206,868,All right. If I can really help...
SK0206,869,Ogami...
SK0206,870,Ah... N-Not so hard...
SK0206,871,Eeek!
SK0206,872,S-Saki?!
SK0206,873,I understand how you're feeling, but I must refuse.
SK0206,874,Me doing this might seem like an easy fix for you, but all it would do is gloss over your troubles.
SK0206,875,You'll get used to being here soon enough. Your anxiety will clear away even without me holding you.
SK0206,876,Ogami...
SK0206,877,Well, I should go. I'm in the middle of searching for Iris.
SK0206,878,Ah, Ogami, please wait...
SK0206,879,Eeek!
SK0206,880,S-Saki?!
SK0206,881,Ogami, won't you answer me?
SK0206,882,Y-Yeah, this is bad.
SK0206,883,I'm supposed to be looking for Iris. I'm sorry, Saki.
SK0206,884,Ah, Ogami, please wait...
SK0206,885,Eeek!
SK0206,886,S-Saki?!
SK0206,887,Saki, are you all right?
SK0206,888,My foot slipped, and... I fell down.
SK0206,889,Ogami, could you please do something to help?
SK0206,890,(Do something to help, she says, but what?)
SK0206,891,Arm (look)
SK0206,892,Hair (look)
SK0206,893,Face (look)
SK0206,894,Mouth (talk)
SK0206,895,Ankle (look)
SK0206,896,Chest (peek)
SK0206,897,Hips (look)
SK0206,898,Leg (peek)
SK0206,899,High heels (look)
SK0206,900,Offscreen (walk)
SK0206,901,Ogami, my ankle hurts more than there. Could you massage it, please?
SK0206,902,(I should probably take her arm and try to help her stand.)
SK0206,903,Arm (grab)
SK0206,904,Saki, I'll lend you my arm. Here, try to stand up.
SK0206,905,Oh my, thank you very much.
SK0206,906,(She has gorgeous black hair.)
SK0206,907,Hair (press)
SK0206,908,Eek! Ogami, please, don't touch me there.
SK0206,909,(It must hurt when she fell. Her face is scrunched up in pain.)
SK0206,910,Oh no... Please, don't look at my face when I'm like this.
SK0206,911,My ankle hurts. I wonder if I twisted it.
SK0206,912,Ogami, could you please massage my ankle?
SK0206,913,Saki, can you stand?
SK0206,914,My ankle hurts. I don't think I can do it alone.
SK0206,915,(It seems like she might have twisted her ankle.)
SK0206,916,Ankle (press)
SK0206,917,Saki, is this where it hurts?
SK0206,918,Ah... Yes, there... Ohh, that feels good...
SK0206,919,Just keep going... Massage it softly... Like that...
SK0206,920,Ohh, how nice...
SK0206,921,A little... harder... Please...
SK0206,922,No... Don't press it that hard...
SK0206,923,Gently, Ogami...
SK0206,924,(Wow, her chest is quite large...)
SK0206,925,(...Come on, Ogami! Now's not the time to be thinking about that!)
SK0206,926,Chest (press)
SK0206,927,Saki, is this where it hurts?
SK0206,928,Ah, that's my chest.
SK0206,929,Ogami, you're unexpectedly bold.
SK0206,930,You mustn't take advantage of this situation to do anything strange.
SK0206,931,(Damn... She saw right through me.)
SK0206,932,Chest (peek)
SK0206,933,(Phew, it really is big...)
SK0206,934,Saki, is your hip OK?
SK0206,935,Yes, my ankle is what got injured.
SK0206,936,But since you're checking me over, would you mind massaging my hip as well?
SK0206,937,Huhh?! Ohh, shoot. What now?
SK0206,938,Hips (press)
SK0206,939,Ahh, yes... Softly... Like that...
SK0206,940,Mhmhm... Ogami, you give such lovely massages.
SK0206,941,Y-You think so? Hahaha...
SK0206,942,Ahh, yes... Softly... Like that...
SK0206,943,(Ohh man, this is getting pretty sensual...)
SK0206,944,Oh, Ogami, please don't look at me that way. It's embarrassing.
SK0206,945,Leg (press)
SK0206,946,Saki, is this where it hurts?
SK0206,947,Ah, lower... Right on my ankle...
SK0206,948,Ah... No... Ogami...
SK0206,949,Don't press right there...
SK0206,950,Ogami, where are you going?
SK0206,951,How cruel of you to leave me here, when I can't even walk!
SK0206,952,OK, OK. I'll stay a bit longer.
SK0206,953,Please, Ogami, stay by my side a little longer...
SK0206,954,Wearing shoes like these, it's no wonder you slipped and fell.
SK0206,955,Saki, do you think you can stand?
SK0206,956,Yes, I think so. And the pain in my ankle is starting to lessen.
SK0206,957,That's good. Looks like you can walk, too.
SK0206,958,Yes, it's thanks to you, Ogami.
SK0206,959,You stayed with me this whole time after I fell. You're ever so kind.
SK0206,960,And you held me so gently...
SK0206,961,It made me so happy that you rubbed my hurt ankle for me.
SK0206,962,You rubbed my hurt ankle with such tenderness that I am filled with joy.
SK0206,963,Though it was unacceptable of you to stare so lustily at my legs...
SK0206,964,Oh, and you even rubbed my leg for me, too. Hmhmhm, thank you.
SK0206,965,Oh, and you even rubbed my leg for me. So thoroughly, too.
SK0206,966,I'm so very happy. Thank you ever so much.
SK0206,967,And on top of that, you even massaged my hip. I'm rather moved.
SK0206,968,Though it was unacceptable of you to let your hand "slip" and touch my chest...
SK0206,969,Though it was unacceptable of you to keep letting your hand "slip" and touch my chest...
SK0206,970,So, Ogami, that's the sort of thing you and Saki were doing together, was it?
SK0206,971,Eep?! That voice...
SK0206,972,S... Sakura!!
SK0206,973,Iris has gone missing, and here you are, fooling around!
SK0206,974,It seems I've interrupted something important, so pardon me. I'll be in my room!
SK0206,975,Sakura, wait! Please, listen to me!
SK0206,976,My ankle appears to have made a complete recovery thanks to your efforts, Ogami.
SK0206,977,How dreadful that Sakura became angry with you, though. Well, I bid you goodnight.
SK0206,978,S-Saki...
SK0206,979,The only reason this happened in the first place is because Saki forced me to come along with her...
SK0206,980,...but I guess I did get a little too carried away.
SK0206,981,Even so, I wish Sakura hadn't lost her temper at me like that.
SK0206,982,Oh man, I give up.
SK0206,983,Why Ogami, it's been an age! How good it is to see you well. Yes, that puts a smile on my face!
SK0206,984,Wh-Who's there? Who're you?!
SK0206,985,What?! Oh come now, come now! Did you forget all about me? What sort of friend are you?
SK0206,986,How could you forget me, Yuichi Kayama? I sat right next to you during our time in the naval academy!
SK0206,987,...Kayama?!
SK0206,988,So it's you, Kayama! Wow, you're looking a lot cooler these days.
SK0206,989,Anyway, what are you doing in a place like this?
SK0206,990,Ahh, it puts a smile on my face to see an old classmate once again...
SK0206,991,Answer the question, Kayama! Why are you even here?
SK0206,992,Come now, those little details hardly matter, do they? No, not at all!
SK0206,993,More importantly, isn't it true what they say? How rare is unsullied joy.

SK0207,101,It's a bit short, but... what do you think?
SK0207,102,Thank you, Mon Frère...
SK0207,103,I'm sure Papa and Mama will be happy, too.
SK0207,104,I will do my best to discipline her."
SK0207,105,That sounds like I'm being a bad kid!
SK0207,106,And I'm not a kid anymore!
SK0207,107,Uh... OK. Let's change it to, "I will do my best to look after her."

SK0207,117,Huh? Why do you say that?
SK0207,118,You're living far away from your parents, but you're always cheerful.
SK0207,119,On top of that, you're writing letters like this to tell them that you're doing OK.
SK0207,120,...
SK0207,121,I'm not all that amazing...
SK0207,122,The thing is... I was locked inside a castle for a long time.
SK0207,123,...A castle?
SK0207,124,Yeah... When I was still a kid, I didn't know how to control my power.
SK0207,125,It was hurting other people, so I was always locked up in my room.
SK0207,126,I see...
SK0207,127,All I ever wanted was to go out and play with Papa and Mama...
SK0207,128,...but the only thing I could do was just talk to Jean-Paul and his friends.
SK0207,129,...
SK0207,130,I'm not great or amazing. The truth is... I'm just so lonely.
SK0207,131,Speak kindly to her.

SK0207,158,Mon Frère...
SK0207,159,Sorry, Iris. I can't find the right words to say, but...
SK0207,160,I'll try to look after you as much as I can.
SK0207,161,Mon Frère...
SK0207,162,I can't replace your parents...
SK0207,163,But I can always be by your side.

SK0207,203,...Huh? Mon Frère?
SK0207,204,Yaaaawn... So I was dreaming, huh.
SK0207,205,Morning, Iris. Did you sleep well?
SK0207,206,Yeah! I slept really well!
SK0207,207,Mon Frère, I saw you in my dream!
SK0207,208,Oh...
SK0207,209,What did you dream about?
SK0207,210,I had a dream, too.
SK0207,211,Should I ask for a performance fee?
SK0207,212,What did you dream about?
SK0207,213,I saw you in my dream, too.
SK0207,214,Should I ask for a performance fee?
SK0207,215,What did you dream about? 
SK0207,216,Tee-hee, it's a secret!
SK0207,217,OK. Then, was it a nice dream?
SK0207,218,Yeah. A super nice one!
SK0207,219,I think... I had a dream, too.
SK0207,220,You had a dream as well, Mon Frère? What did you dream about?
SK0207,221,Uhm... What was it...
SK0207,222,Huh. I think I forgot.
SK0207,223,You forgot? Aw... I wanted to hear about it.
SK0207,224,What was it like, huh? Should I ask for a performance fee?
SK0207,225,Whaaat!? Mon Frère, you meanie!!
SK0207,226,Hahaha, just kidding. As long it's not a bad dream, that's good enough for me.
SK0207,227,Yeah! Of course it was a good dream!
SK0207,228,Me too. I saw you in my dream last night.
SK0207,229,What? You saw me... in your dream?
SK0207,230,Yeah. I forgot how it went...
SK0207,231,...but the thing I remember most is seeing you.
SK0207,232,Perhaps we shared a dream last night.
SK0207,233,Yeah! I think so, too! That must be it!
SK0207,234,Mon Frère... Do you want to know what I dreamt about?
SK0207,235,I'd like to. But if you tell other people, your dream won't happen in real life.
SK0207,236,What, is that so!?
SK0207,237,Then I won't tell it! I absolutely, absolutely won't tell anyone!
SK0207,238,...
SK0207,239,Thank you, Mon Frère.
SK0207,240,I'm not... lonely anymore.
SK0207,241,...I see.
SK0207,242,Well, let's go for breakfast.
SK0207,243,Yeah!
SK0207,244,It's Sakura! Morning!!
SK0207,245,I-Iris...
SK0207,246,Good morning, Sakura. Looks like it'll be a pleasant morning.
SK0207,247,Ogami...
SK0207,248,Come on, you two! Let's eat breakfast right away!
SK0207,249,You're right. OK, let's eat!
SK0207,250,...Yeah!
SK0207,251,My... Good morning, everyone.
SK0207,252,Oh. You're early today, Ogami. About to have breakfast?
SK0207,253,Good morning, sir. You look sharp today. Are you about to go somewhere?
SK0207,254,Yep, got business with the Ministry of the Army. Saki's coming along, too.
SK0207,255,Iris, how about you ask the manager to help send your letter?
SK0207,256,A letter, huh? Yeah, I'll send it for you.
SK0207,257,Really? Are you sure, Uncle?!
SK0207,258,Why not? It's no problem to me, my dear Iris.
SK0207,259,Thank you so much, Uncle!
SK0207,260,The alarm?!
SK0207,261,It's early in the morning, but our enemies are still coming, huh.
SK0207,262,Ogami, I still need to head to the ministry, so please take care of the Flower Division.
SK0207,263,Understood, sir!
SK0207,264,Iris, I'll make sure to send this letter, so don't worry.
SK0207,265,Yeah! I'm counting on you, Uncle!
SK0207,266,Yeah, you can count on me. I'm off...
SK0207,267,Uh-oh.
SK0207,268,What's wrong, sir?
SK0207,269,Oh, my shoelace just snapped is all. Ah, it's not a big deal.
SK0207,270,Oh my. I'm afraid that's a sign of bad luck.
SK0207,271,We're heading out for our mission, Commander.
SK0207,272,OK. Watch yourself out there!
SK0207,273,Yeah! I'll do my best for today!
SK0207,274,It's time to move out! Let's go, Ogami, Iris!
SK0207,275,The Imperial Assault Troupe, Flower Division has assembled!
SK0207,276,Where's the enemy appeared at?
SK0207,277,According to intel, Shibuya.
SK0207,278,The Hex Mechs seem to be carrying a lot of material.
SK0207,279,If it's Shibuya, we can use the Thunderstrike to get there quick!
SK0207,280,Thunderstrike? What's that?
SK0207,281,It's an underground train for transporting Koubu, and the pride of Imperial Assault Troupe.
SK0207,282,It's a bullet train, so it can take us to our destination in no time.
SK0207,283,What do you think the enemy is planning with the all that material they're moving in?
SK0207,284,They have to be assembling something!
SK0207,285,We should wipe them out immediately while they're still busy!
SK0207,286,We could also wait and see what it is they're up to before deploying.
SK0207,287,(Hmm... Which strategy should we use?)
SK0207,288,Destroy enemies immediately.
SK0207,289,Wait and collect intel.
SK0207,290,We'll destroy the enemy immediately. We're not gonna just let the Black Demon Society do as they please!
SK0207,291,We'll also destroy all the material they've gathered.
SK0207,292,We better hold back and wait for more intel.
SK0207,293,We still don't know their objective yet, so we shouldn't make any careless moves.
SK0207,294,The troupe's intelligence team, the Moon Division, is currently doing recon for us.
SK0207,295,...
SK0207,296,We just received word from the Moon Division. The enemy's objective is... to build a forward operating base.
SK0207,297,So you just need to destroy those. Seems the material that must be destroyed has already been marked, so focus on those.
SK0207,298,Understood, destroying the marked supplies.
SK0207,299,Roger!
SK0207,300,Mon Frère, give the order, please!
SK0207,301,Imperial Assault Troupe, move out!
SK0207,302,We're headed out, Iris!
SK0207,303,Imperial Assault Troupe, we're moving out! Our destination is Shibuya!
SK0207,304,Let's do our best, Ogami!
SK0207,305,It's a perfect chance to move my body before breakfast!
SK0207,306,Preparation for sortie, completed.
SK0207,307,I absolutely won't lose, today!
SK0207,308,Mon Frère is with me, so I can't lose!
SK0207,309,We're going out, Iris. Are you ready?
SK0207,310,Yeah! I'm ready!
SK0207,311,Are you ready too, Mon Frère? Don't leave anything behind, OK?
SK0207,312,Hahaha. OK, we're moving out!
SK0207,313,Yaaaawn... Crap, that was quite the yawn.
SK0207,314,Ogami, don't tell me you were pulling an all-nighter.
SK0207,315,Actually, Sakura, last night Mon Frère was...
SK0207,316,Aaaaah! Iris, hold it!
SK0207,317,Oh... right. It's supposed to be a secret.
SK0207,318,...?
SK0207,319,A-Anyway, Imperial Assault Troupe, move out!
SK0207,320,OK. I'm done with my business. And I just sent out Iris's letter, too.
SK0207,321,I'm worried about this Black Demon Society business. Well, Ogami is taking care of them. I'm sure he has it handled.
SK0207,322,Now, back to the theater.
SK0207,323,D-Don't try to stop me. I-I need to... get back... to the... theater...
SK0207,324,My precious children... They're all... waiting for me there...

SK0208,3,And we got Reni as our new friend! I'm not lonely anymore!
SK0208,4,Well, in regards to Reni, that's good. However, I still don't think Japanese men are all that special.
SK0208,5,Hahaha. Harsh as usual, Orihime.
SK0208,6,Reni, our next battles may get harder, but let's keep doing our best, together.
SK0208,7,...I don't mind. I came here to fight, after all.
SK0208,8,With battles of this caliber, we can't afford to be anything less than perfect.
SK0208,9,Huh? Looks like there's someone contacting us.
SK0208,10,I'll check it now.
SK0208,11,Hehe! Mon Frère!
SK0208,12,What is it, Iris?
SK0208,13,Don't forget your pro-mise with me!
SK0208,14,Promise...?
SK0208,15,Oh, Mon Frère! You promised to play with me, remember?
SK0208,16,O-Oh. Right.
SK0208,17,OK! Once we got home, first we'll have a date! Tee-hee, it's a deal!
SK0208,18,Together we'll go shopping, have lunch and then, and then...
SK0208,19,We'll aaaalways be together, no matter what!
SK0208,20,Er, boy... I made quite the promise, didn't I?
SK0208,21,O-Ogami, everyone! We got a situation!!
SK0208,22,What's wrong, Sakura!? Is something wrong!?

SK0301,1,So, this... This is the hospital Mr. Yoneda was sent to, right?
SK0301,2,Ogami, Mr. Yoneda is safe now, right?
SK0301,3,Mr. Yoneda can't die now, he couldn't be, could he?
SK0301,4,...
SK0301,5,Anyway, let's hurry. We're racing against time.
SK0301,6,Ah, Saki!
SK0301,7,Everyone...
SK0301,8,Saki! How is Mr. Yoneda right now?
SK0301,9,He's in... critical condition.
SK0301,10,For now, he's stable and his vitals have gotten better, but he's currently in a coma.
SK0301,11,...Oh no!!
SK0301,12,Uncle was just talking with me this morning...
SK0301,13,He said that he was going to send my letter out... He was so cheerful!
SK0301,14,Uwaaaaah! Uncle Yoneda!!
SK0301,15,Who shot him!?
SK0301,16,We haven't been able to figure that out yet. The only thing we know for sure was that he was shot in front of the Army Ministry building.
SK0301,17,Forgive me... To think this happened while I was out with him.
SK0301,18,...Anyway, let's see how things look.
SK0301,19,...Agreed.
SK0301,20,Mr. Yoneda! Ichiro Ogami, reporting in.
SK0301,21,...!!
SK0301,22,Mr. Yoneda!
SK0301,23,Uncle! Uncleee Yoneda!
SK0301,24,The doctor told me that... the possibility of him regaining consciousness is close to zero.
SK0301,25,N-No...
SK0301,26,Uwaaaaaah! Uncle! Uncle!!
SK0301,27,...
SK0301,28,...
SK0301,29,Mr. Yoneda...
SK0301,30,Sorry Ogami, but each customer is only allowed to purchase one photo at a time.
SK0301,31,I see. That's too bad...
SK0301,32,I'm sorry, Ogami. I can only sell you one piece at a time to a customer.

SK0302,2,What will happen to this Imperial Assault Troupe if he's gone!?
SK0302,3,...
SK0302,4,No. I can't stay down like this forever.
SK0302,5,In times like this, it's my job to cheer everyone as the captain of Flower Division.
SK0302,6,They must be feeling down too. I gotta check on everyone else.
SK0302,7,There's no visitors. We wouldn't expect many until we put on our summer performance, so that makes sense.
SK0302,8,In a situation like this, it's a blessing that we're practically closed...
SK0302,9,It's empty here. No one's around.
SK0302,10,...It feels kind of lonely. I'll check another room.
SK0302,11,Looks like there's nobody here.
SK0302,12,I'll just have to check another room.
SK0302,13,Hello there, Ogami! Would you like to buy something?
SK0302,14,Buy a photo.
SK0302,15,Talk to Tsubaki.
SK0302,16,Leave.
SK0302,17,Could I buy a photo?

SK0302,38,That'll be 50 sen. Thank you very much!
SK0302,39,That's Orihime's photo, isn't it?
SK0302,40,Her photo is very popular right now.
SK0302,41,So make sure you grab it before it runs out!
SK0302,42,Let's see... Orihime's photo, right?
SK0302,43,That'll be 50 sen. Thank you very much!
SK0302,44,That's Reni's photo.
SK0302,45,We just put out that photo for sale, so make sure you get it fast!
SK0302,46,Let's see... Reni's photo, right?
SK0302,47,That'll be 50 sen. Thank you very much!
SK0302,48,Hm, so you're not going to buy any?
SK0302,49,You look cheerful, Tsubaki.
SK0302,50,Yes. Since this is the entrance to the theater...
SK0302,51,...times like these make me want to greet visitors with a smile even more.
SK0302,52,I see... You're very strong.
SK0302,53,Ehe... Thanks a lot.
SK0302,54,But... When visitors are few and I'm alone...
SK0302,55,I can't help but feel... lonely.
SK0302,56,...The manager will be fine. I'm sure that he'll come back here good as new.
SK0302,57,Please greet him with that smile when he gets back, Tsubaki.
SK0302,58,...Yes! You can count on me!
SK0302,59,I'm absolutely going to greet him with that bright smile!
SK0302,60,You can leave meeting the manager to me!
SK0302,61,Well, I should be going. Keep up the good work.
SK0302,62,Thank you very much! Come back soon!
SK0302,63,Tsubaki's surely doing her best to stay cheerful, although it must be hard for her.
SK0302,64,I have to hold myself together, just like her.
SK0302,65,Thank you very much! Come back and buy another photo next month!
SK0302,66,Tsubaki's surely doing her best to be cheerful.
SK0302,67,Looks like no one eats at this hour. Well, of course.
SK0302,68,There's no sign of anyone in the kitchen. Guess I'll check another room.
SK0302,69,Looks like no one's come in. Oh man, what a waste of effort.
SK0302,70,It's really hot and humid. Guess it is the rainy season.
SK0302,71,Looks like nobody's here, guess I'll check another room.
SK0302,72,No one's around. Looks like nobody's visiting the theater before the summer performance opens.
SK0302,73,Guess I'll check another room, then.
SK0302,74,Oh, Ogami. Is there something you need?
SK0302,75,Let me hear any new gossip.
SK0302,76,I'll come back later.
SK0302,77,Sorry, Ogami, but I'm afraid I don't much of anything to tell you about.
SK0302,78,After all of this gloomy news lately... I'm sorry.
SK0302,79,Seems that the culprit who shot Manager Yoneda hasn't been caught yet.
SK0302,80,Rumor has it that it was an assassination attempt organized by foreign operatives, but I wonder if that's true.
SK0302,81,Hmm, I wonder.
SK0302,82,About the enemy that showed up several days ago, they called themselves, "The Black Demon Society", correct?
SK0302,83,Yeah...
SK0302,84,The thing is we still don't know what exactly their motive is.
SK0302,85,How strange. What will happen to this city?
SK0302,86,On top of that, I wonder when Sumire will return...
SK0302,87,Right. She's been at her family's home for two months now. I'm worried about her.
SK0302,88,Kanna, Kohran, and even Maria haven't returned either... 
SK0302,89,What will happen to the Flower Division?
SK0302,90,I just noticed, Saki doesn't work in this room, right?
SK0302,91,That's correct. Saki is working as the manager's personal secretary.
SK0302,92,That's why she's not in our office.
SK0302,93,I'm sure that she's worried about Mr. Yoneda, too. To have such thing happened to him...
SK0302,94,We already scheduled "King Lear" for our next performance...
SK0302,95,But with our situation right now, can we even make it?
SK0302,96,I heard this earlier...
SK0302,97,People found Mr. Yoneda... covered with blood in front of the Army Ministry.
SK0302,98,They found him as if here were crawling on the ground to get somewhere before losing consciousness.
SK0302,99,He must have been desperately trying to return to the theater before he blacked out.
SK0302,100,Mr. Yoneda...
SK0302,101,Just as the Flower Division went out to battle, of all days...
SK0302,102,Usually he'd have come along on the mission with everyone.
SK0302,103,Somehow the culprit knew that the manager was headed to the Ministry.
SK0302,104,Where did they get that information from?
SK0302,105,It's said that Mr. Yoneda was shot from the building across from the Ministry of the Army.
SK0302,106,The singular bullet was able hit him from a very far distance...
SK0302,107,So the police believe that the culprit is quite an expert sniper.
SK0302,108,Additionally, there seems to be no clues at the crime scene that might lead us to the culprit.
SK0302,109,The investigation will be difficult.
SK0302,110,Oh... Ogami, have you bought Maria's photo?
SK0302,111,Since she's in America, I thought that at least I can get her photo, so...
SK0302,112,How about I give you Maria's call number, Ogami?
SK0302,113,Are you sure?
SK0302,114,She already gave me her number in case of emergency.
SK0302,115,I'm not sure if it's a good idea to tell her about this whole thing...
SK0302,116,But you can talk to her if you call "13900."
SK0302,117,13900, right? Thanks, Yuri.
SK0302,118,Oh... Ogami, have you bought Kanna's photo?
SK0302,119,Yeah. Since we're so far apart, I figured I should buy it.
SK0302,120,Right. The theater does feels desolate without her around.
SK0302,121,Oh, I know! Ogami, how about I give you Kanna's call number?
SK0302,122,Huh! Are you sure?!
SK0302,123,Of course! Now get ready, Kanna's number is "14000", got it?
SK0302,124,Tune the Cinematron to 14000 so you can talk to her. 
SK0302,125,Ogami, Kanna's in the middle of training, so reach out to her with the Cinematron.
SK0302,126,Tell her the whole story right away!
SK0302,127,Yeah, I got it! Thanks, Yuri.
SK0302,128,Oh, Ogami... Have you bought Sumire's photo?
SK0302,129,Yeah. Since she's back at her home, I thought I should at least have this for myself.
SK0302,130,Well, how about I give you her call number, Ogami?
SK0302,131,Are you sure?
SK0302,132,She already gave me her number in case of an emergency.
SK0302,133,I'm sure that she already heard about this incident...
SK0302,134,So try to talk with her for a bit, Ogami.
SK0302,135,You can speak to her if you dial, "13800" on the Cinematron.
SK0302,136,13800, is it? Thanks, Yuri.
SK0302,137,Sorry, I don't have any fun stories for this month...
SK0302,138,But I'm sure gossip will jump into my lap real soon!
SK0302,139,That's right. I heard the manager hasn't paid back the tab for all the liquor he drinks.
SK0302,140,Hahaha, then we really have to bring him back home.
SK0302,141,Well, I'm taking my leave now. Good luck with your work, you two.
SK0302,142,Yes. Thank you for all your hard work as well.
SK0302,143,Come again soon!
SK0302,144,Now, where should I go next?
SK0302,145,Please tell me if anything new happens to the manager, ladies.
SK0302,146,Yes. Thank you for all your hard work as well.
SK0302,147,Come again soon!
SK0302,148,Now, where should I go next?
SK0302,149,...
SK0302,150,Saki...
SK0302,151,Ah, Ogami?
SK0302,152,What are you doing here?
SK0302,153,I... I'm just wandering around in circles.
SK0302,154,The thing is, I was supposed to be helping the manager with his errands.
SK0302,155,To think that this whole incident happened while I was with him... I'm sorry.
SK0302,156,I left him for just a split-second... It's all so upsetting.
SK0302,157,...
SK0302,158,...Well, it's time for me to go. See you around, Ogami.
SK0302,159,Saki...
SK0302,160,Ah... Ogami.
SK0302,161,Sakura, something wrong?
SK0302,162,...I found this photo.
SK0302,163,A photo?
SK0302,164,Yes. I saw it sitting on the manager's desk.
SK0302,165,It's from when Yoneda was fighting alongside my father.
SK0302,166,My father is the one who's standing on the far left.
SK0302,167,He died during The Kouma War seven years ago...
SK0302,168,...
SK0302,169,Other than Mr. Yoneda, everyone's... gone.
SK0302,170,Sakura...
SK0302,171,If we lose Mr. Yoneda, too, I... I...
SK0302,172,Ogami! He's going to be OK, right?!
SK0302,173,He'll be back to his office for sure, soon!
SK0302,174,Yes. I'm certain he'll be back.
SK0302,175,It's hard to say...
SK0302,176,Yes. I'm certain he'll be back.
SK0302,177,It's hard to say...
SK0302,178,Yes. I'm certain he'll be back.
SK0302,179,It's hard to say...
SK0302,180,Slowly grab her shoulder.
SK0302,181,Yes, I'm sure he'll be back. There's no way a man like Mr. Yoneda would die like that.
SK0302,182,...You're right. He'll be back to work in his office in no time!
SK0302,183,I wonder, do you think he'll still be drinking as much as he usually does?
SK0302,184,Hehe. Come on, Ogami.
SK0302,185,Talking to you makes me feel better. Thank you so much, Ogami.
SK0302,186,Well, I'll be taking my leave now... Excuse me.
SK0302,187,Thanks goodness. I hope that cheers her up for a while.
SK0302,188,OK, now let's go to the others.
SK0302,189,...It's hard to say. There's a good chance that he won't regain consciousness.
SK0302,190,H-How could you say that?! I... I don't believe it!
SK0302,191,Yoneda... I know Mr. Yoneda will be back!
SK0302,192,S-Sakura!
SK0302,193,What have I done? In times like these, what I should be doing is lifting their spirits.
SK0302,194,...
SK0302,195,Ogami...
SK0302,196,...Everything will be fine, Sakura. I'm sure Manager Yoneda will come back.
SK0302,197,Let's take a good care of the theater while he's away.
SK0302,198,...Yes!
SK0302,199,Talking to you makes me feel better. Thank you so much, Ogami.
SK0302,200,Well, I'll be taking my leave now... Excuse me.
SK0302,201,Thanks goodness. I hope that cheers her up for a while.
SK0302,202,OK, now let's go to the others.
SK0302,203,...
SK0302,204,No matter how much we try to cheer each other up, without action, they might just end up being empty words.
SK0302,205,For now, let's think about what should we do to take care of the theater.
SK0302,206,...Yes.
SK0302,207,Well, I'll be taking my leave now... Excuse me.
SK0302,208,Let's go find the others, too.
SK0302,209,Looks like Saki has left already. Let's take a look at another room.
SK0302,210,We need to take good care of the theater until Mr. Yoneda comes back...
SK0302,211,No one's here. I thought Orihime would be, though.
SK0302,212,Oh well, I'll just check another room.
SK0302,213,Just as I thought, nobody's here. Let's go to another room.
SK0302,214,No one's here, huh. We don't use this room much when we don't have a play going on.
SK0302,215,When we held Reni's welcoming party here, the manager looked so cheerful...
SK0302,216,...Now's not the time to dwell on the past. I need to move forward.
SK0302,217,No one's here. Hmm...
SK0302,218,...Huh? I thought I heard something coming from the stage.
SK0302,219,It's Sakura, she's cleaning the stage floor.
SK0302,220,I have to keep my head up as well.
SK0302,221,No one's here. Let's check another room.
SK0302,222,No one's here. I don't even feel Kayama's presence like last time.
SK0302,223,What was he doing in this place, anyway?
SK0302,224,Ah... Is that you, Ogami?
SK0302,225,Sakura, what're you doing here?
SK0302,226,Well, I was cleaning up the stage floor.
SK0302,227,I just needed to do something with my hands to get my mind off things.
SK0302,228,You did great.
SK0302,229,Can I help?
SK0302,230,I see. You did a great job so far.
SK0302,231,Thanks!
SK0302,232,Please go talk with the others, Ogami. They need it.
SK0302,233,Yeah, just leave it to me!
SK0302,234,Whew... Now let's go check the others!
SK0302,235,Mind if I help you?
SK0302,236,Hehe, thank you for your consideration.
SK0302,237,But, I'm sorry...
SK0302,238,I just want to do things by myself for now.
SK0302,239,I see... Got it. I know how you feel.
SK0302,240,Keep doing your best then, Sakura.
SK0302,241,Yes! Thank you very much, Ogami.
SK0302,242,Doing things by oneself, huh?
SK0302,243,Maybe she's recalling memories with her father after seeing that picture earlier.
SK0302,244,...
SK0302,245,Ogami? Is there something wrong?
SK0302,246,No, it's nothing. How strong you are, Sakura, to be doing this after what's happened.
SK0302,247,No... I'm just a weakling.
SK0302,248,I'm still an immature little girl who can't stay still because of all this anxiety.
SK0302,249,My father would laugh seeing me like this.
SK0302,250,Sakura...
SK0302,251,I'm sure the others are feeling down as well. Please give them your support, Ogami.
SK0302,252,...Yeah, leave them to me!
SK0302,253,I'll be going.
SK0302,254,...Yes! See you later.
SK0302,255,Whew... Now let's go check the others!
SK0302,256,Oh, Ogami.
SK0302,257,Are you still cleaning up, Sakura?
SK0302,258,Yes... I just needed to do something with my hands to get my mind off things.
SK0302,259,...I see.
SK0302,260,I'll be going now. Keep at it.
SK0302,261,OK. Thank you so much.
SK0302,262,Sakura... She's trying her best to hide her sadness.
SK0302,263,I need to make sure everyone can rely on me.
SK0302,264,No one's here. Let's check another room.
SK0302,265,Our summer performance is coming this month, at last.
SK0302,266,It's bound to do something about the depressing mood this place has had lately. 
SK0302,267,I came here again just to be sure. No one's here.
SK0302,268,Sniff... Sniff...
SK0302,269,(...Iris?)
SK0302,270,Sniff... Uncle... *sob*
SK0302,271,...
SK0302,272,Say something.
SK0302,273,Iris... Sorry, I just noticed you were crying. 
SK0302,274,Ah... Mon Frère!
SK0302,275,I was thinking just to leave you alone for a bit...
SK0302,276,But after seeing you like that, I just not reach out for you.
SK0302,277,Mon Frère...
SK0302,278,I just... couldn't stop my tears no matter how hard I tried.
SK0302,279,Cheer up, Iris. A sad face doesn't suit you.
SK0302,280,A cheerful smile fits you the best.
SK0302,281,Uh-huh... Thanks, Mon Frère.
SK0302,282,I don't know if I can smile right away... but I'll try.
SK0302,283,I hope there's something I can do to bring back her smile...
SK0302,284,(Let's leave her be for now.)
SK0302,285,(This must be especially hard for her...)
SK0302,286,(That said, you're doing well, Iris.)
SK0302,287,Let's not go to the courtyard for now.
SK0302,288,No one's here, huh. Let's just get going.
SK0302,289,...
SK0302,290,Sakura...
SK0302,291,Ah! Ogami...
SK0302,292,(Sakura... Is she crying?)
SK0302,293,...
SK0302,294,Sorry, Sakura... I'll be going.
SK0302,295,Ogami, were you perhaps... worried about me?
SK0302,296,Y-Yeah. I thought that maybe you didn't want anyone seeing you crying.
SK0302,297,Ogami, you're so... That's very kind of you, Ogami.
SK0302,298,After I saw Iris just now, I couldn't hold my tears either...
SK0302,299,...I'll let you be. Take care.
SK0302,300,...Yes.
SK0302,301,(I-It's not the time to stare at her hair.)
SK0302,302,...
SK0302,303,Ogami, please don't stare at me.
SK0302,304,Oh, sorry...
SK0302,305,(Her tears, she's trying to stop them from rolling down her face...)
SK0302,306,I said don't stare at me!
SK0302,307,S-Sakura...
SK0302,308,I-I don't want you to see me like this...
SK0302,309,(Sakura doesn't want me looking her in the eye.)
SK0302,310,(She's on the verge of sobbing... I don't know where I should look when talking to her.)
SK0302,311,(J-Just where do I look in this situation!?)
SK0302,312,...
SK0302,313,(Oh no, Sakura looks really down...)
SK0302,314,(I better stop staring right now.)
SK0302,315,I-It's surprisingly sunny today, even though it's the rainy season. Wouldn't you say, Sakura?
SK0302,316,...
SK0302,317,(I don't know where I should look while talking to her. What should I do?)
SK0302,318,...
SK0302,319,After I saw Iris just now, I couldn't hold my tears either...
SK0302,320,Sorry, Ogami. I didn't mean to show you my face like this.
SK0302,321,...I'll be going.
SK0302,322,Ah... S-Sakura!
SK0302,323,I'm sorry!
SK0302,324,Sakura...
SK0302,325,I should've just left her alone...
SK0302,326,What a clear sky. It seems like there's a break in the rainy season.
SK0302,327,I hope everyone can be cheerful and bright again, just like this blue sky.
SK0302,328,...Hm? Iris and Sakura are talking to each other.
SK0302,329,There, there, Iris. Don't cry.
SK0302,330,Hic... But, but...
SK0302,331,Iris...
SK0302,332,Ah... Ogami.
SK0302,333,Mon Frère... Is Uncle gonna die?
SK0302,334,I don't want that to happen! Waaaaah!
SK0302,335,Cheer her up.
SK0302,336,Wipe her tears.
SK0302,337,Cheer her up.
SK0302,338,Impersonate her crying.
SK0302,339,It'll be OK, Iris. Cheer up.
SK0302,340,Mr. Yoneda won't die. He'll be back with us safe and sound soon enough.
SK0302,341,...Are you sure?
SK0302,342,Yeah, I'm sure of it.
SK0302,343,What Ogami said was true. It's great to hear that, isn't it, Iris?
SK0302,344,...Yeah.
SK0302,345,I'll try to stay stronger for a while. I'm going now.
SK0302,346,Seems that Iris managed to cheer up. Thank goodness.
SK0302,347,Thank you for consoling Iris, Ogami.
SK0302,348,I somehow feeling better, too.
SK0302,349,Is that so. I'm glad that helps.
SK0302,350,Well, I'm taking my leave too.
SK0302,351,I hope they can cheer up for a bit.
SK0302,352,Iris, here. I'll wipe your tears.
SK0302,353,Oh, Mon Frère...
SK0302,354,For now, let's hold our tears.
SK0302,355,...OK.
SK0302,356,Now, let's smile.
SK0302,357,...OK. Tee-hee, like this?
SK0302,358,Yup, that's great. Are you feeling better?
SK0302,359,Yeah... Thanks, Mon Frère and Sakura.
SK0302,360,I'll try to stay stronger for a while. I'm going now.
SK0302,361,Seems that Iris managed to cheer up. Thank goodness.
SK0302,362,Thank you for consoling Iris, Ogami.
SK0302,363,It touched my heart too.
SK0302,364,Is that so. I'm glad that helps.
SK0302,365,Well, I'm taking my leave too.
SK0302,366,I hope they can cheer up for a bit.
SK0302,367,I don't want Manager Yoneda to die! Uwaaaah!
SK0302,368,M... Mon Frère?!
SK0302,369,Hahaha. Sorry, my bad. I didn't mean to surprise you.
SK0302,370,But, you see, Iris, it was weird to see me crying, right?
SK0302,371,Y-Yeah...
SK0302,372,So, you shouldn't cry as well, Iris.
SK0302,373,Yeah... Thanks, Mon Frère and Sakura.
SK0302,374,I'll try to stay stronger for a while. I'm going now.
SK0302,375,Seems that Iris managed to cheer up. Thank goodness.
SK0302,376,Thank you for consoling Iris, Ogami.
SK0302,377,But I was really surprised to see you crying out of nowhere.
SK0302,378,Hahaha... It was too surprising, I guess.
SK0302,379,Well, I'm taking my leave too.
SK0302,380,I hope they can cheer up for a bit.
SK0302,381,Now, Iris. Don't cry. Ogami is watching.
SK0302,382,Huh... Hic...
SK0302,383,Let's get going now. I'm sure Manager Yoneda will be just fine.
SK0302,384,Yeah... Hic... OK.
SK0302,385,Well now, excuse us, Ogami.
SK0302,386,Oh, uh... Yeah...
SK0302,387,Ugh... I couldn't make myself be helpful for them. Let's just get going.
SK0302,388,No one's here.
SK0302,389,I wonder where everyone is. Let's check another room.
SK0302,390,The seats are empty.
SK0302,391,Everyone must be... having their state of mind empty like these seats.
SK0302,392,Looks like nobody's here. Better check another room.
SK0302,393,They're not here. I wonder if they are holing up in their rooms.
SK0302,394,They must be really shocked by this incident. That's likely to happen.
SK0302,395,No one comes here. Uh...
SK0302,396,Looks like no one's playing at this hour, after all.
SK0302,397,Of course there's no way I'm gonna play, too. Better get going.
SK0302,398,Nobody's here, after all. Guess I'll just get going.
SK0302,399,Now... What should I do?
SK0302,400,Make a call.
SK0302,401,Do it later.
SK0302,402,I gotta tell this to members that are being away, too.
SK0302,403,OK, I'm gonna call them.
SK0302,404,Now... Who should I call?

SK0302,429,Forgive me, Maria. I... I lied to her.
SK0302,430,It's fine, Captain. I would do the same thing to her.
SK0302,431,You lied so she won't need to worry... I'm sure that she'll understand.
SK0302,432,...
SK0302,433,The doctor said that... There's a chance he may be unable to... regain consciousness.
SK0302,434,I see... So he got hit... by a gunshot.

SK0302,441,I'm not sure, but...
SK0302,442,I just want everyone to know the whole story.
SK0302,443,...
SK0302,444,...
SK0302,445,Chief... Why did ya say nothing?
SK0302,446,...
SK0302,447,I understand... I'll try to pay him a visit soon.
SK0302,448,But... just who in the world that would shot our Manager Yoneda!?
SK0302,449,I absolutely... I absolutely gonna make them pay for it!
SK0302,450,Captain...
SK0302,451,I'm sorry, Maria. That's all I could do.
SK0302,452,...
SK0302,453,I can only pray for the manager, so...
SK0302,454,...please encourage everyone in there, Captain.
SK0302,455,OK, I got it.
SK0302,456,I ended up call Maria and Kohran...
SK0302,457,Kohran... She's not picking up.
SK0302,458,Wah! D-Don't ring so sudden in this situation!
SK0302,459,Huh, Kanna!? So this is your call number... Is something happened in your place?
SK0302,460,Oh, Boss! I'm dealing with a crowd of people right now. Sorry, I'm gonna disconnect.
SK0302,461,Wah! D-Don't ring so sudden in this situation!
SK0302,462,Kanna... Is something happened?
SK0302,463,Boss! I'm dealing with a crowd of people right now. Sorry, I'm gonna disconnect.
SK0302,464,Ah... She cut the call.
SK0302,465,It's no good... There's no response.
SK0302,466,Huh!? Whose number is it? But they're not picking it up.
SK0302,467,Sumire's not picking up. Maybe she's not in her room.
SK0302,468,Uh... No response after all.
SK0302,469,Hello, this is Maria Tachibana.
SK0302,470,Maria!? So this is your call number.
SK0302,471,Oh, Captain. I was just about to call you.

SK0302,476,Chief! And Maria, too!
SK0302,477,Great timing, please tell me the whole thing!
SK0302,478,Maria? It's Ogami.
SK0302,479,Captain, I heard the news about the menager from Count Hanakoji.
SK0302,480,It's midnight in here, but I thought that you may call me so I waited.
SK0302,481,This is the Hanayashiki Branch! Chief, are ya there!?

SK0302,487,Manager is doing fine. He's not in a terrible condition. Captain just told so.
SK0302,488,Ya sure? Yer serious, right?
SK0302,489,...Yes, I'm serious. When have I ever lied to you?
SK0302,490,You're right. You never lied before, Maria.
SK0302,491,What... I'm so relieved my tears just come out.
SK0302,492,...
SK0302,493,...
SK0302,494,Anyway, Captain... Should I return to Japan?
SK0302,495,Yeah... Please.
SK0302,496,Leave this to us.
SK0302,497,Yeah, please. I need you to help us.
SK0302,498,Wait, Maria. Chief may say so...
SK0302,499,...but right now yer still having an important duty of escorting Count Hanakoji, right?
SK0302,500,You can leave this matter to us.
SK0302,501,Kohran...
SK0302,502,...I understand. I'll stay in America for now.
SK0302,503,I get that you're worried, but you can leave this matter to us.
SK0302,504,We'll make sure to deal with this in your place.
SK0302,505,Captain...
SK0302,506,Way to go, Chief! Now that's our captain!
SK0302,507,Rest assured, Maria! Chief will take care of the theater.
SK0302,508,...I understand. I'll stay in America for now.
SK0302,509,Uh... What would be the best...
SK0302,510,Maria, leave this to us.
SK0302,511,I'm getting calm for a bit, and we have our chief, so I think we'll be fine.
SK0302,512,Now we're having a hard time, but let's do our best! OK, Chief?
SK0302,513,Kohran...
SK0302,514,...I understand. I'll stay in America for now.
SK0302,515,OK, I'm gonna back to work right now. See ya, guys.
SK0302,516,Hmhm... Kohran ended up consoled me.
SK0302,517,Maria...
SK0302,518,Please take care of everyone in the Flower Division, Captain.
SK0302,519,I'll pray for the manager's safety from America.
SK0302,520,I ended up call Maria and Kohran...
SK0302,521,Hello, this is Maria Tachibana.
SK0302,522,Oh, Maria!? So this is your number.
SK0302,523,Captain!? So you know my number.
SK0302,524,I'm going to turn the screen on. Please wait for a while.
SK0302,525,Is something the matter? Is there something urgent that you want to talk about?
SK0302,526,No, I just... wanted to talk with for a little more.
SK0302,527,I see... I was actually about to rest. It's already late in here.
SK0302,528,I see. It's midnight in America, isn't it?
SK0302,529,Yes. I'm sorry, but may I excuse myself?
SK0302,530,OK. Good night, Maria.
SK0302,531,Good night... Captain.
SK0302,532,I didn't put too much thought since Cinematron makes us can communicate directly, but...
SK0302,533,We're being far apart indeed. It's now midnight in America.
SK0302,534,Maria's not picking up.
SK0302,535,Good afternoon. This is Capital News.
SK0302,536,There has a new fact discovered regarding the Hex Mechs attack in Shibuya and Uguisudani.
SK0302,537,Both incidents have one thing in common, which is the appearance of the Hex Mechs doing destructive acts.
SK0302,538,The group behind these incident has been identified as, "Black Demon Society."
SK0302,539,This name was found in testimonies from witnesses in both incidents, which make it extremely credible.
SK0302,540,The Metropolitan Police Department and Army have set up task forces that seems to be their way of responding the situation.
SK0302,541,Next is the follow-up report regarding shooting incident of a Second Lieutenant in Army, Yoneda.
SK0302,542,After being shot by an unknown person, Second Lieutenant Yoneda has been hospitalized...
SK0302,543,...but until now he's still in a serious condition and hasn't regain consciousness.
SK0302,544,Regarding this incident, The Metropolitan Police Department has give their statement during press conference...
SK0302,545,...that they would proceed to investigate the case based on evidence found at the scene.
SK0302,546,However, given the fact that there are almost no witnesses, they expect that the investigation would be difficult.
SK0302,547,And lastly, we're bringing you weather forecast for this week.
SK0302,548,The seasonal rain front will stay stationary, so overcast will cover the skies throughout Japan.
SK0302,549,However, a patch of blue sky will reveal in Tokyo and its surroundings from today until tomorrow.
SK0302,550,Today we will have a sunny break over the rainy season, which will be perfect to do the laundry.
SK0302,551,That's it for Capital News, brought to you by the Capital Daily Report.
SK0302,552,That concludes today's broadcast. Stay tune for tomorrow's broadcast.
SK0302,553,A red shadow opposes the evildoers lurking in the darkness of the capital. His name is Masked Red!
SK0302,554,Masked Red, the boy wonder of justice! Today he continues his fight for peace in the capital!
SK0302,555,Serial Radio Drama Masked Red, The Terrifying Mummy, Part 2
SK0302,556,Creak... Creak... The mummy starts to move, making a creaking sound.
SK0302,557,The mummy releases his hands off the girl, turns it back and flees. 
SK0302,558,Hold it! Stop!!" Masked Red pulls the trigger of his two Colts. 
SK0302,559,Bang! Bang!<br>The mummy can still run away, even though bullets pierced it's body.
SK0302,560,The mummy vanishes into the dark. Masked Red straddles his steambike.
SK0302,561,Well, I'm going to after that strange mummy, Miss!"
SK0302,562,Ah, please be careful, Mr. Masked Red. Be safe on your way!"
SK0302,563,Thank you, young lady!"<br>He races Mach Red.<br>Vrooooommmm!
SK0302,564,The mummy is running amid the dark night. Mach Red's spotlight caught its back.
SK0302,565,Before long, they're inside the thicket. The mummy disappears into a mysterious western house at there.
SK0302,566,Could it be that it's the mummy's lair? What waits Masked Red in the old western house?
SK0302,567,Fight on, Masked Red! You're our hero, Masked Red!<br>-The End
SK0302,568,Go, Masked Red! Fight on, Masked Red! Tune in next time!
SK0302,569,I'm worried about the other members, so let's end this transmission.
SK0302,570,Now... Where should I head next?
SK0302,571,Huh? Looks like someone's coming.
SK0302,572,Guess I'll just stop the transmission.
SK0302,573,Excuse me, Ogami. I just got an announcement.
SK0302,574,Is that Kasumi? Wait a second, I'll open the door.
SK0302,575,What's wrong, Kasumi?
SK0302,576,Let's continue later. I'm focusing on consoling the members in here for now.
SK0302,577,Ayame used to live in this room, wasn't she?
SK0302,578,You right there... Is that you, Ensign?
SK0302,579,Hi, Orihime.
SK0302,580,...I heard that the previous deputy commander used to live in this room.
SK0302,581,Now that there's no deputy commander and Mr. Yoneda has collapsed, aren't you discouraged?
SK0302,582,It's just like you said.
SK0302,583,No, I don't feel like that.
SK0302,584,I have you, Orihime.
SK0302,585,It's just like you said. I'm worried about what can I do by myself from now on.
SK0302,586,Heh, just what I thought. Japanese men are so weak!
SK0302,587,In spite of being the captain, I can't believe you express you worry to your member!
SK0302,588,Uh... I-I was...
SK0302,589,In times like this, shouldn't you act more like a captain?
SK0302,590,Let me tell you, everyone's being spineless right now, so you got to set them straight! 
SK0302,591,Ah, Orihime...
SK0302,592,Oh boy... I was supposed to encourage her, but I ended up being encouraged by her instead.
SK0302,593,No, I don't feel like that. In times like this, I have to draw everyone together.
SK0302,594,Uh-huh... You're acting like a captain, for once.
SK0302,595,Careful not to put too much 
SK0302,596,Well... I need to respond this situation with calm attitude.
SK0302,597,OK... I'll keep this spirit and talk with the members. 
SK0302,598,I'm fine... I have you, Orihime.
SK0302,599,Huuuuh!? S-Stop joking!!
SK0302,600,I'm not joking, you know.
SK0302,601,J-Just stop it! It's so gross that I got goosebumps!
SK0302,602,Oh boy... She ran away at full speed.
SK0302,603,...Guess I'll get going too.
SK0302,604,Well, I'd be lying if I said that I'm not discouraged.
SK0302,605,But I'm sure that Ayame will say, "keep yourself together, Ogami"
SK0302,606,if she ever caught me saying things like that.
SK0302,607,Uh-huh...
SK0302,608,I think your way of saying it still sounds like a loser, though.
SK0302,609,Well, just keep at it.
SK0302,610,Now, I should get going too.
SK0302,611,This room is empty for now. Let's go check another room.
SK0302,612,...
SK0302,613,(Orihime? What is she doing in this place?)
SK0302,614,Please... Give me... Amen.
SK0302,615,(She's saying something...)
SK0302,616,...!? Who is it!?
SK0302,617,E-Ensign!? Since when you were there!?
SK0302,618,Well... I just got here.
SK0302,619,And what are you doing in this place, Orihime?
SK0302,620,T-That's none of your business! It has nothing to do with you!!
SK0302,621,Ah... She went away.
SK0302,622,If I'm not mistaken, something like this happened in here before... 
SK0302,623,I wonder what does Orihime do in the attic.
SK0302,624,Oh, w-what are you doing in here, Ensign?
SK0302,625,You too, Orihime. What are you doing here?
SK0302,626,Heheh! It has nothing to do with you!
SK0302,627,Now if you'll excuse me.
SK0302,628,What's with her... I'm getting curious.
SK0302,629,Orihime has went away, huh.
SK0302,630,Oh well, I'll just check another room.
SK0302,631,Nobody's here. I'll just have to check another room, then.
SK0302,632,In times like this, I want to read books slowly and forget the time.
SK0302,633,No. I gotta encourage the members first.
SK0302,634,Nobody's here, huh. There's nothing but reeks of mold.
SK0302,635,Reni... Is she inside?
SK0302,636,It's just a piece of paper from a notebook. I suppose that's fitting for someone like Reni.
SK0302,637,I better check another room, I guess.
SK0302,638,...Who's there?
SK0302,639,It's Ogami. Can I talk for a while?
SK0302,640,...
SK0302,641,OK, excuse me.
SK0302,642,Sorry, am I bothering you?
SK0302,643,Not particularly...
SK0302,644,(Guess I'll try to talk with her directly.)
SK0302,645,(Her gray hair looks unusual...)
SK0302,646,...
SK0302,647,(What a beautiul eyes... But, somehow I don't feel any emotion out of them)
SK0302,648,...
SK0302,649,...
SK0302,650,(He just keep staring me with those blank gaze, I accidentally averted my eyes away.)
SK0302,651,(Expressionless just like usual, huh...)
SK0302,652,...
SK0302,653,(His clothes are neat, looks like it make him easy to move. It fits him well.)
SK0302,654,...
SK0302,655,(I can't keep up with the conversation. Guess I should leave.)
SK0302,656,Thanks for having me, Reni. I gotta go now.
SK0302,657,...I have to go to somewhere else too.
SK0302,658,(What's that...? If it's a brooch, usually girls are the ones who wearing it.)
SK0302,659,(It's framing a jewel with the same color as Reni's eyes)
SK0302,660,...
SK0302,661,(Her room looks tasteless, though.)
SK0302,662,Reni... Where do you usually sleep?
SK0302,663,I sleep on the chair.
SK0302,664,Don't you have any other furniture, like a bed or a dresser?
SK0302,665,...I don't need such unnecessary things.
SK0302,666,O-OK...
SK0302,667,(It'd be rude for me to look all around here.)
SK0302,668,Reni, what's your opinion regarding today's incident?
SK0302,669,You must be shocked that Manager Yoneda got shot, so how's your condition?
SK0302,670,Consider the angle of the bullet that penetrated him, and　the degree of his wound... 
SK0302,671,By keeping those aspects on mind, I calculate that the culprit shooted from far away.
SK0302,672,It must have been done by a professional.
SK0302,673,How do you get that?
SK0302,674,It must have been done by a professional.
SK0302,675,How do you get that?
SK0302,676,T-That's not what I'm talking!
SK0302,677,So it must have been done... by a professional.
SK0302,678,True. It's possible that the culprit has undergone training for sharpshooting.
SK0302,679,Way to go, Reni. You're an expert on this kind of matter.
SK0302,680,How do you get that, Reni?
SK0302,681,I've also experienced in that.
SK0302,682,Huh?!
SK0302,683,T-That's not what I'm asking! What I want to ask is...
SK0302,684,Doesn't it shocks you... or something like that.
SK0302,685,...No.
SK0302,686,R-Reni...
SK0302,687,I answered your question. Is that enough?
SK0302,688,Oh, uh... Yeah...
SK0302,689,(I actually wanted to ask a different question...)
SK0302,690,I have to go to somewhere else.
SK0302,691,H-Hey, wait a minute...
SK0302,692,Ah, he went away.
SK0302,693,...
SK0302,694,He left me just like that. Guess I better get going too.
SK0302,695,...
SK0302,696,Looks like Reni's not here. He said about going somewhere, I guess.
SK0302,697,Looks like Reni's not here.
SK0302,698,Sakura... Is she inside?
SK0302,699,Too bad, she's not here.
SK0302,700,It's just like Sakura to have a cute nameplate like this.
SK0302,701,Let's go check another room.
SK0302,702,If Kanna was around, she would surely brighten up the mood.
SK0302,703,When she'll get back... Kanna...
SK0302,704,A nametag hangs on the door, almost as if it's guarding Kanna's room.
SK0302,705,There's no reason to hang around since Kanna's gone. I'll go somewhere else.
SK0302,706,Orihime... Is she inside?
SK0302,707,The nameplate has a simple design, but it sure looks high class.
SK0302,708,I better check another room, I guess.
SK0302,709,...Who is it?
SK0302,710,It's Ogami. Can I talk with you, Orihime?
SK0302,711,I refuse. It's time for my "siesta."
SK0302,712,What's a siesta?
SK0302,713,Have a nice nap.
SK0302,714,It's not the time for a nap!
SK0302,715,What's a siesta?
SK0302,716,Heheh! So you don't know about siesta, huh, Ensign?
SK0302,717,Siesta means, "taking a nap."
SK0302,718,My mood will get bad if I don't do it, so good night!
SK0302,719,H-Hey, Orihime!
SK0302,720,...
SK0302,721,Oh boy, she's really went sleep.
SK0302,722,Looks like it's not a good time for talk.
SK0302,723,Can't help it. Have a nice nap, Orihime.
SK0302,724,Good night! Don't dwell yourself too much, Ensign.
SK0302,725,It's good to have a nap sometimes.
SK0302,726,Oh boy, she's being so carefree.
SK0302,727,Orihime, now's not the time for having a nap!
SK0302,728,What a nuisance! Just when I'm about to have a nap!
SK0302,729,What's your deal, Ensign!?
SK0302,730,We got to do something after Manager Yoneda got shot!
SK0302,731,How can you taking a nap in times like this?
SK0302,732,Ugh... I've had enough of this!
SK0302,733,Do you actually think that Mr. Yoneda will recover if I stay awake?
SK0302,734,Taking a nap is the best way to rest. Don't just assuming things based on your imagination!
SK0302,735,I-I see...
SK0302,736,You're the captain, so you should calm down!
SK0302,737,I'm gonna have my siesta for now, so don't disturb me!
SK0302,738,Ugh... I ended up getting yelled at.
SK0302,739,You got nothing to talk about? OK, good night!
SK0302,740,I was about to talk with her, but let's do it later.
SK0302,741,Orihime is having her siesta right now, so let's just leave her be.
SK0302,742,There's no response. I wonder if Orihime is going somewhere.
SK0302,743,In times like this, having Maria with us could be more reassuring.
SK0302,744,She's in New York right now, so of course she's not here.
SK0302,745,It's Maria's nameplate.
SK0302,746,There's no reason to hang around since Maria's gone. I'll go somewhere else.
SK0302,747,Iris... Is she inside?
SK0302,748,So Iris's nameplate is shaped like Jean-Paul...
SK0302,749,I better check another room, I guess.
SK0302,750,Iris's not here. Where did she go?
SK0302,751,Kohran must've been shocked to hear about today's incident.
SK0302,752,She's at the Hanayashiki Branch, isn't she?
SK0302,753,A gear-shaped nameplate, huh? It's just like her.
SK0302,754,There's no point in staying here without Kohran around. Let's head to another place.
SK0302,755,Sumire might come back here soon, but...
SK0302,756,...she's still in her home.
SK0302,757,This is a pretty subtle design, considering it's Sumire.
SK0302,758,There's no reason to hang around since Sumire's gone. I'll go somewhere else.
SK0302,759,Manager Yoneda talked about Lieutenant Yamazaki in here some time ago.
SK0302,760,Manager was sad about Lieutenant Yamazaki's death, and now such a thing happened to him.
SK0302,761,We got to take care of this room until Manager Yoneda returns.
SK0302,762,I can't feel down right now. I just got to look forward!
SK0302,763,Oh, Ogami. Such a fantastic room we have here!
SK0302,764,Yeah. This steam processor is so great that there are only few of these in Japan.
SK0302,765,Too bad I don't understand what's so great about this place at all.
SK0302,766,I have the same thought. I don't understand what kind of move that would occur in which part.
SK0302,767,Well, it's nice too see strange things like this. I'll see you later, Ogami.
SK0302,768,Speaking of "strange", I guess there would be nothing as strange as this, though.
SK0302,769,Looks like Saki has already seen enough. Nobody's here anymore.
SK0302,770,I guess I better get going too.
SK0302,771,Even though we already have an intensive care unit in the theater, we ended up not using it now.
SK0302,772,Manager was sent to the Army Hospital right away, so we got no choice.
SK0302,773,Now that I think about it, I wonder if Manager Yoneda's doing fine right now...
SK0302,774,The scent of medicines reminds me of him in the hospital earlier.
SK0302,775,Manager Yoneda...
SK0302,776,Reni took her bath in here earlier.
SK0302,777,But jeez, I was really surprised to know that she's a girl.
SK0302,778,This humid weather makes me want to take a quick bath.
SK0302,779,No. Hold it, hold it. I got to encourage the members first.
SK0302,780,I want to take a quick bath, but... let's hold it for now.
SK0302,781,Right now I gotta talk to every members.
SK0302,782,Oh? Looks like someone's in the bathroom right now.
SK0302,783,These are Reni's clothes. He must have been sweating a lot after training.
SK0302,784,How's the water temperature?
SK0302,785,Let's check another room.
SK0302,786,How's the water temperature?
SK0302,787,Let's check another room.
SK0302,788,Let's take a quick bath too.
SK0302,789,Reni, how's the water temperature?
SK0302,790,...Good.
SK0302,791,Well, looks like he's relaxing himself.
SK0302,792,OK, now let's check the others.
SK0302,793,I'd feel bad for interrupting him while he's relaxing, so let's head to another room.
SK0302,794,OK, I'm gonna take a quick bath too.
SK0302,795,We're both boys, so I'll try to talk to him while washing his back.
SK0302,796,Hi, Reni. Is it OK to join you?
SK0302,797,...
SK0302,798,Wash his back.
SK0302,799,Soak in the bathtub.
SK0302,800,Sing.
SK0302,801,OK, Reni. Let me wash your back.
SK0302,802,Huh? I didn't expect your body would look so slender.
SK0302,803,You look like a girl.
SK0302,804,...
SK0302,805,And, is this just me, or does your chest...
SK0302,806,...
SK0302,807,R-Reni... D-Don't tell me you're actually, a...
SK0302,808,...I'm a girl.
SK0302,809,Wh-Whaaaaaaaatttt!?
SK0302,810,S-Sorry! I didn't know you were a girl! I'm sorry for barging in!
SK0302,811,...I'm not bothered. No need to apologize.
SK0302,812,There are still some functional difference between male and female.
SK0302,813,A-Anyway, I'm getting out right away. Sorry for barging in!!
SK0302,814,Huft... Huft... I thought my heart was going to jump out of my chest.
SK0302,815,But still... To think that Reni is a girl... Uh...
SK0302,816,Despite being a girl, how did she learn techniques and knowledge about warfare?
SK0302,817,I don't think she would answer even if I ask her. Uhm...
SK0302,818,Phew, this bath feels great.
SK0302,819,Somewhat I feel like it's warmth seeped into the bottom of my heart.
SK0302,820,...I'm getting out first, then.
SK0302,821,Getting out already? You should've just enjoy it for a while.
SK0302,822,The blood circulation in my muscles has improved by the effect of heat and increasing blood pressure. This is enough for me.
SK0302,823,Oh, jeez. That's just so like you.
SK0302,824,Phew, that was a great bath.
SK0302,825,Oh no, 15 minutes have passed! 
SK0302,826,Hmm hmm~ Hmm~ Hmm~
SK0302,827,Why don't you try singing too, Reni? It feels good to hear the echoes of your singing.
SK0302,828,I've never sung outside of my performances.
SK0302,829,Huh? So you've never humming or singing for yourself? 
SK0302,830,Yeah, since it's not necessary.
SK0302,831,I'm getting out first.
SK0302,832,Oh, jeez. That's just so like you.
SK0302,833,Phew, that was a great bath.
SK0302,834,Oh no, 15 minutes have passed! 
SK0302,835,...
SK0302,836,What?
SK0302,837,I-I just... You look like a girl from behind.
SK0302,838,And, is this just me, or does your chest...
SK0302,839,...
SK0302,840,R-Reni... D-Don't tell me you're actually, a...
SK0302,841,...I'm a girl.
SK0302,842,Wh-Whaaaaaaaatttt!?
SK0302,843,S-Sorry! I didn't know you were a girl! I'm sorry for barging in!
SK0302,844,...I'm not bothered. No need to apologize.
SK0302,845,There are still some functional difference between male and female.
SK0302,846,A-Anyway, I'm getting out right away. Sorry for barging in!!
SK0302,847,Huft... Huft... I thought my heart was going to jump out of my chest.
SK0302,848,But still... To think that Reni is a girl... Uh...
SK0302,849,Despite being a girl, how did she learn techniques and knowledge about warfare?
SK0302,850,I don't think she would answer even if I ask her. Uhm...
SK0302,851,...
SK0302,852,Reni...
SK0302,853,Sorry about earlier.
SK0302,854,So you're a girl...
SK0302,855,Let's get into the bath again.
SK0302,856,Sorry about earlier.
SK0302,857,It's cute when you put it that way.
SK0302,858,Let's get into the bath again.
SK0302,859,I'm sorry about earlier. I didn't realize that you were... a girl.
SK0302,860,...I don't mind.
SK0302,861,But... does everyone already know that you're a girl.
SK0302,862,I don't know. You can tell them if that's important to you.
SK0302,863,Is that... OK for you?
SK0302,864,I don't bother. I don't mind of things like gender.
SK0302,865,...I'm leaving.
SK0302,866,Reni...
SK0302,867,So you're a girl... Man, I was really surprised.
SK0302,868,Yeah. I don't mind about it, though.
SK0302,869,People just set on their mind that I'm a boy.
SK0302,870,Set on...? What's that supposed to mean?
SK0302,871,So you're a girl, huh... It's cute when you put it that way, though.
SK0302,872,Cute?
SK0302,873,Is that... a good thing?
SK0302,874,Y-Yeah... I was about to praise you here.
SK0302,875,OK, I'll take that as a good thing.
SK0302,876,So Reni is a girl, huh... I get it.
SK0302,877,I don't know how should I say this... but somehow, I'm happy.
SK0302,878,Since you said that gender has nothing do with you, how about we go to the bath... again?
SK0302,879,Just once is enough for me. I'm not doing wasteful thing.
SK0302,880,Ah... Did I went too far?
SK0302,881,If you got nothing to talk, I'm leaving.
SK0302,882,Ah, R-Reni!
SK0302,883,I should've just straightly apologize to her.
SK0302,884,Reni has gone. Perhaps she go to somewhere else after done changing.
SK0302,885,Guess I better get going too.
SK0302,886,I want to swim for a while to relieve my mind. The weather has been humid too.
SK0302,887,Let's not do it. I gotta consider the others' feelings.
SK0302,888,Nobody's here. Guess I'll just check another room.
SK0302,889,Hi, Reni. Are you training right now?
SK0302,890,...I'm about to finish.
SK0302,891,You're not acting different from usual. Aren't you depressed?
SK0302,892,Why?
SK0302,893,Why"? About Manager Yoneda who got shot, of course.
SK0302,894,...It can't be helped. It's his fault for putting his guard down.
SK0302,895,How could you say that?
SK0302,896,You may be right...
SK0302,897,How could you say things like that!? We're talking about a person who's hanging between life and death!
SK0302,898,But that's what happens in warfare.
SK0302,899,What's done is done. What matters is what we do next.
SK0302,900,If we think it without harboring any feeling, you may have a point, but...
SK0302,901,There's no place for emotion in warfare.
SK0302,902,You may be right. What matters is to prevent the same thing happen twice.
SK0302,903,We may have to steel ourselves so things like this won't happen again anymore.
SK0302,904,True.
SK0302,905,T-That's some way to say it, Reni.
SK0302,906,I'm just saying what's on my mind.
SK0302,907,What's done is done. What matters is what we do next.
SK0302,908,If we think it without harboring any feeling, you may have a point, but...
SK0302,909,There's no place for emotion in warfare.
SK0302,910,I'm going now.
SK0302,911,Ah, Reni!
SK0302,912,Ah, Reni went away.
SK0302,913,Nobody's here. Guess I'll check another room.
SK0302,914,Nobody's here. All I found are junks and reek of oil.
SK0302,915,My, Ogami. Fancy meeting you here.
SK0302,916,Oh, Saki. What're you doing in here?
SK0302,917,I came here to see the Koubu.
SK0302,918,Now that I'm working at this theater, I just want to look at everything.
SK0302,919,I see...
SK0302,920,Seeing these fancy things really is satisfying. Well, I'll see you later, Ogami.
SK0302,921,She's right. You can only see these thing in this hangar.
SK0302,922,There's nothing to do in here. Saki has gone too.
SK0302,923,...Ogami.
SK0302,924,What's wrong, Kasumi?
SK0302,925,I just got contacted by a person from the sponsors...
SK0302,926,He said that all of the sponsors will cut their supports to the theater altogether.
SK0302,927,Wh-What!? That's just so sudden. W-Why...
SK0302,928,I don't understand, but if it keeps going like this...
SK0302,929,The Imperial Assault Troupe will soon run out of funds.
SK0302,930,Damn it... Why now, of all times?!
SK0302,931,Ogami...
SK0302,932,What should we do about this?
SK0302,933,Hmm...
SK0302,934,Let's do our best on Summer performance!
SK0302,935,Let's endure it.
SK0302,936,We're done for.
SK0302,937,I know, let's do our best on Summer performance!
SK0302,938,If it success, many visitors will come to see it...
SK0302,939,...and we can manage the funding for sure!
SK0302,940,I see.... That's a great idea!
SK0302,941,What's more, we need to have an objective in order to shake off gloomy mood that shrouds everyone.
SK0302,942,If everyone give their all doing rehearsals for Summer performance, we can forget our sadness!
SK0302,943,For now, we have to endure it. We're just having a bad luck, so there's nothing we can do.
SK0302,944,We need to endure ourselves... until good luck comes.
SK0302,945,But Ogami, if we stay silent, our funds won't be enough.
SK0302,946,Is that so? Uh...
SK0302,947,Ogami, I have a suggestion.
SK0302,948,If our next Summer performance becomes a success, many visitor will come to see it, and we can manage the funds.
SK0302,949,Let's do our best for the Summer performance, so that we can drive away this depressing atmosphere.
SK0302,950,...You're right. Perhaps that'll be a good idea.
SK0302,951,We're done for. Why these bad stuffs are coming one after another...
SK0302,952,Ogami, please don't say something so discouraging.
SK0302,953,All of us, including me, are putting our hopes in you right now.
SK0302,954,Sorry... You're right, I was too weak-willed.
SK0302,955,But... how are we supposed to break ourselves from this situation?
SK0302,956,Ogami, I have a suggestion.
SK0302,957,If our next Summer performance becomes a success, many visitor will come to see it, and we can manage the funds.
SK0302,958,Let's do our best for the Summer performance, so that we can drive away this depressing atmosphere.
SK0302,959,...You're right. Perhaps that'll be a good idea.
SK0302,960,Ugh... What should we do!?
SK0302,961,Ogami, I have a suggestion.
SK0302,962,If our next Summer performance becomes a success, many visitor will come to see it, and we can manage the funds.
SK0302,963,Let's do our best for the Summer performance, so that we can drive away this depressing atmosphere.
SK0302,964,...You're right. Perhaps that'll be a good idea.
SK0302,965,Well, how about we gather everyone from the Flower Division in the Dressing Room?
SK0302,966,OK, Kasumi. Well, let's make the summer performance a success!
SK0302,967,Sorry Ogami, but each customer is only allowed to purchase one photo at a time.
SK0302,968,I see. That's too bad...
SK0302,969,I'm sorry, Ookami. I can only sell you one piece at a time to the same person.
SK0302,970,Oh, really? That's too bad...

SK0303,1,Is everyone here?
SK0303,2,What did you want to tell us, Ogami?
SK0303,3,The truth is, I have some bad news.
SK0303,4,The Imperial Assault Troupe's financial backers are going to discontinue their support all at once.
SK0303,5,What? But... why?!
SK0303,6,Discontinue... financial?
SK0303,7,It means that we will no longer be getting any more money.
SK0303,8,And I suppose that will be the last of this theater too...
SK0303,9,If our supplies are cut off, we will no longer be able to continue fighting.
SK0303,10,Ogami... What should we do?
SK0303,11,...
SK0303,12,(How should I discuss the performance with them?)
SK0303,13,Be hopeful and encouraging.
SK0303,14,Get them fired up.
SK0303,15,Aren't you all forgetting something important?
SK0303,16,WE are the "Imperial Assault Troupe." If we put on a show, people will come to see us.
SK0303,17,If the summer production is a success this month, our money problem will work itself out! Right, everyone?
SK0303,18,You're right! We can put on a play!
SK0303,19,Mon Frère, you're so smart!
SK0303,20,Well, I guess it is better than doing nothing at all.
SK0303,21,OK then. Let's get started on rehearsals for the summer production right away!
SK0303,22,Now's the time for all of us to give it everything we've got!
SK0303,23,If the summer production is successful, I'm sure we'll be able to get by financially.
SK0303,24,Let's shake off this foul mood and get ourselves fired up!
SK0303,25,You're right. The most important thing we can do right now is to keep moving forward!
SK0303,26,Yes. If we need supplies, let us procure them on our own.
SK0303,27,I'm gonna work real hard too!
SK0303,28,OK then. Let's get started on rehearsals for the summer production right away!
SK0303,29,...Are you serious, Ensign? Here you are, the captain, and yet you have given no thought to this at all?
SK0303,30,I... I have thought about it! I was just trying to figure out how to bring it up.
SK0303,31,I was just thinking that if we work hard enough at the summer production, we'll be able to get by financially...
SK0303,32,You're right. We could put on a play.
SK0303,33,Yeah! Let's all do our best!
SK0303,34,You should have said so in the first place instead of beating about the bush.
SK0303,35,Ah, don't be like that. Anyway, let's give the rehearsals for the summer production our all!
SK0303,36,Still, there is just one issue...
SK0303,37,What's that?
SK0303,38,We're scheduled to put on "King Lear" for our summer production...
SK0303,39,But right now, we don't have any performers suitable for playing a lead male part like that.
SK0303,40,With things as they are, we may not be able to hold the play at all.
SK0303,41,Oh no... We can't do the play? We won't have a summer performance at all?
SK0303,42,Does that mean... the troupe will break up?!
SK0303,43,I don't want that! I wanna stay together with all of you!
SK0303,44,...
SK0303,45,Aw, c'mon you guys! How can every last one of ya look so dang miserable?
SK0303,46,Huh? That voice...
SK0303,47,Whassamatter? You're the Flower Division, this ain't like you! Shape up, people!
SK0303,48,Kanna, is that you?!
SK0303,49,Yo, I'm back!
SK0303,50,Wahhh, Kanna!
SK0303,51,Aww, Iris... What's wrong?
SK0303,52,Kanna, the manager... Commander Yoneda was shot!
SK0303,53,Wh-What the hell?! How is he? Is he alive or dead?!
SK0303,54,Manager Yoneda is at the army hospital. He's confined to bed right now.
SK0303,55,Sorry, Kanna. This isn't a very warm welcome...
SK0303,56,I get how you're feelin', Boss. We just gotta figure out what to do from here.
SK0303,57,...
SK0303,58,By the way, what's with all the talk about holdin' a play at a time like this?
SK0303,59,It's pretty sudden, but... the troupe is going to lose all its outside funding.
SK0303,60,So we all wanted to do whatever we can while Yoneda is in the hospital.
SK0303,61,I gotcha, Boss.
SK0303,62,All right, enough with all this doom an' gloom!
SK0303,63,Let's put on a show that'll fill every seat in the house. That'll give ol' Yoneda one helluva surprise once he's back!
SK0303,64,An actress has to be able to smile, no matter how bad things get!
SK0303,65,Oh, we gotta couple o' new faces.
SK0303,66,This is Orihime Soletta and Reni Milchstraße, both originally from the Star Division.
SK0303,67,Nice to meetcha!
SK0303,68,Ciao!
SK0303,69,Likewise...
SK0303,70,Let's see, as for the others... I know Kohran's at Hanayashiki, and Maria's over in America...
SK0303,71,Wait a sec, I don't see Sumire anywhere.
SK0303,72,Sumire is at her family's home right now.
SK0303,73,Sheesh, and at a time like this. What kinda "top star" is she, anyway?!
SK0303,74,Hahaha, it really bothers you that Sumire's not here, doesn't it?
SK0303,75,C'mon, don't gimme that crap! Not like I care if she's around or not!
SK0303,76,Well, at least we have you back now, Kanna.
SK0303,77,With Kanna in the role of King Lear, we can finally put on our summer production!
SK0303,78,All right! Now that's decided, we better get training started right away!
SK0303,79,Kanna, it's not training, it's rehearsal!
SK0303,80,Ah shoot. I'm so used to talkin' about my karate training that it just slipped out.
SK0303,81,Anyways, it's rehearsal time, everyone! Let's do this!
SK0303,82,And with that, the rehearsal for the Flower Division's summer production was finally underway.
SK0303,83,Whoa, so you're a girl?
SK0303,84,I didn't realize at all...
SK0303,85,If that's the case, I wish you'd said something from the beginning...
SK0303,86,Living creatures all begin from the same place. Gender is only finalized during one's gestation in the womb.
SK0303,87,In that sense, gender means little when examining one individual among a species.
SK0303,88,Aw, forget it. I got no idea what you're talkin' about.
SK0303,89,W-Well, I guess whether Reni's a boy or a girl, it doesn't change much in the end.
SK0303,90,Hee hee, yep. Reni is still Reni! Nothing's changed at all!
SK0303,91,Kanna's cheer seemed to rub off on the entire Flower Division, and rehearsals were going well.
SK0303,92,And the Flower Division decided to add their own spin on the story of King Lear.
SK0303,93,Hmm...
SK0303,94,Hm? What's the matter, Kanna?
SK0303,95,Ol' King Lear meets a pretty tragic fate in the end, don't he?
SK0303,96,Why are you sounding so surprised? King Lear is a tragedy; it's always been this way.
SK0303,97,I mean, I guess so...
SK0303,98,I know! Why don't we take a risk and change the ending into a happy one?
SK0303,99,We can run a play where King Lear is a vibrant older man, full of life and determination.
SK0303,100,We all want Mr. Yoneda to be well and healthy again, so we can put all those feelings into the play.
SK0303,101,I agree! Hey Reni, you think so too, right?
SK0303,102,That's fine.
SK0303,103,Changing King Lear into a happy ending... Are you all right in your heads?
SK0303,104,Aww, it's fine. 'Sides, ain't it like Manager Yoneda's always sayin'?
SK0303,105,Lighten up a little!" We gotta run headfirst towards what we're wishin' for!
SK0303,106,Right!
SK0303,107,Right... I can't sit back on my heels, either.
SK0303,108,With the commander gone, I have to step up and protect this theater.
SK0303,109,Yo, Boss!
SK0303,110,Hm? Is that Kanna calling me?
SK0303,111,Phew, finally caught ya.
SK0303,112,Kanna, what's up?
SK0303,113,Will ya come with me for a sec, Boss?
SK0303,114,Huh? Where to?
SK0303,115,Don't worry about it! Let's go, already!
SK0303,116,H-Hey, wait! If you pull my arm like that, you're gonna tear it right off!
SK0303,117,So, why'd you bring me to the courtyard?
SK0303,118,You didn't forget, didja Boss? We made a promise before I left for Okinawa.
SK0303,119,I want ya to see just how much stronger I've gotten.
SK0303,120,To put it plainly, I wanna do a bit of sparrin' with ya.
SK0303,121,All right, let's do this!
SK0303,122,Sure, if you think I'm enough of a challenge.
SK0303,123,Anything but that!
SK0303,124,Sure, if you think I'm enough of a challenge.
SK0303,125,Anything but that!
SK0303,126,All right, let's do this! Go ahead and show me the fruits of your training. I can take it.
SK0303,127,That's the spirit! You sure know how to speak my language, Boss.
SK0303,128,Sure, if you think I'm enough of a challenge. Though I doubt I could match your skills.
SK0303,129,You're gonna be just fine, Boss. Far as I'm concerned, you're a worthy opponent.
SK0303,130,Anything but that! There's no way I could hold my own against you in karate... Please spare me!
SK0303,131,Nope, don't think you can wriggle your way outta this one! Come at me with everything ya got.
SK0303,132,What, too scared to even respond? Chill out, Boss, you're not gonna die or anything.
SK0303,133,All right, I'll explain how this is gonna work.
SK0303,134,I'll attack from one of three positions: up high, in the middle, and from below.
SK0303,135,If I attack from up high, I'll go for your head. If I'm attacking from the middle, I'll strike your abdomen.
SK0303,136,And if I come from below, I'll attack your legs. Easy, yeah?
SK0303,137,OK, let's do a quick test run. First off... Up high!
SK0303,138,Guard your head.
SK0303,139,Guard your abdomen.
SK0303,140,Guard your legs.
SK0303,141,(For high attacks, I should guard my head!)
SK0303,142,Nicely done, Boss! Just like that!
SK0303,143,(Uhh... I'll guard my abdomen!)
SK0303,144,Gwaahh!
SK0303,145,C'mon man, this is only the first hit!
SK0303,146,(Uhh... I'll guard my legs!)
SK0303,147,Yeooowch!
SK0303,148,Come on, Boss! You gotta guard your head from high attacks. Get it together!
SK0303,149,(Uhh... Um... What should I guard?)
SK0303,150,Gwaahhh!!
SK0303,151,Boss! If you stand around with your head in the clouds, you're gonna get your ass kicked!
SK0303,152,Yeep!
SK0303,153,Now, I'm gonna jab from the middle! Hiyaaaaah!
SK0303,154,Guard your head.
SK0303,155,Guard your abdomen.
SK0303,156,Guard your legs.
SK0303,157,(...I'll guard my head!)
SK0303,158,Huoooh!!!
SK0303,159,What're you doing? You call yourself a Navy Ensign?!
SK0303,160,(For the middle, I should guard my abdomen!)
SK0303,161,Yes, I stopped it!
SK0303,162,Good one, Boss!
SK0303,163,(...I'll guard my legs!)
SK0303,164,Huueehhh!
SK0303,165,If I come from the middle, you gotta guard your abdomen! Didja forget already?!
SK0303,166,(A jab from the middle... Err... Where should I...?)
SK0303,167,Hurrk!! *cough* *cough*
SK0303,168,Boss! If you stand around with your head in the clouds, you're gonna get your ass kicked!
SK0303,169,Yeep!
SK0303,170,All right, time for the real deal! Next, try and dodge my attacks as fast as ya can!
SK0303,171,If I come from up high, you should duck. If I come from below, then jump. Got it? Stay on your toes!
SK0303,172,All right, first I'm gonna jab from up top!
SK0303,173,Duck.
SK0303,174,Jump.
SK0303,175,Guard your head.
SK0303,176,Jump.
SK0303,177,Guard your head.
SK0303,178,(An attack from above, I better duck!)
SK0303,179,How was that? I dodged your jab!
SK0303,180,Nice job, Boss! I better start gettin' serious, too.
SK0303,181,(I'm gonna jump!)
SK0303,182,Gwaahhh!
SK0303,183,What're you doin', Boss? You're supposed to jump when I attack from below!
SK0303,184,(An attack from above means... I should guard my head!)
SK0303,185,Yeeeowch! That was a lot stronger than before.
SK0303,186,Yep, I'm comin' at ya for real this time.
SK0303,187,If you don't dodge properly from here on, I'll blow right past your guard!
SK0303,188,Ulp... Guess I better make sure to dodge.
SK0303,189,(Uh... What was I supposed to do?! Jump?... Or duck?...)
SK0303,190,Gwaahhh!
SK0303,191,C'mon, Boss! Ya gotta duck when I come from above, and jump when I come from below!
SK0303,192,Now I'm comin' from below! Hiyyyahh!
SK0303,193,Duck.
SK0303,194,Jump.
SK0303,195,Guard your legs.
SK0303,196,Duck.
SK0303,197,Guard your legs.
SK0303,198,(I'm gonna duck!)
SK0303,199,Gwaahhh!
SK0303,200,Jeez, Boss! Try a little harder, will ya?
SK0303,201,(A low attack, I need to jump!)
SK0303,202,Saw that one coming!
SK0303,203,There we go! Now that's what I'm talkin' about!
SK0303,204,(An attack from below, I better guard my legs!)
SK0303,205,Sh-Shoot! I... can't stop it!
SK0303,206,Gwaaaahh!!
SK0303,207,Yeeeowch! That was a lot stronger than before.
SK0303,208,Yep, I'm comin' at ya for real this time.
SK0303,209,If you don't dodge properly from here on, I'll blow right past your guard!
SK0303,210,Ulp... Guess I better make sure to dodge.
SK0303,211,(Uh... What was I supposed to do?! Jump?... Or duck?...)
SK0303,212,Gwaahhh!
SK0303,213,C'mon, Boss! Ya gotta duck when I come from above, and jump when I come from below!
SK0303,214,Last round, now. This time... I want you to counterattack, Boss!
SK0303,215,My head, abdomen, or feet. Wherever you see an opening, get in there and strike!
SK0303,216,B-But Kanna, if I do that...
SK0303,217,I'll be fine, don't worry!
SK0303,218,Let's go, Boss! I'm comin' in with a roundhouse kick! Hyaaahhhh!!
SK0303,219,(There! I see an opening near her feet!)
SK0303,220,Duck!
SK0303,221,Duck, then leg sweep!
SK0303,222,Duck, then jump!
SK0303,223,Duck!
SK0303,224,Duck, then jump!
SK0303,225,Hngh! I need to duck!
SK0303,226,...
SK0303,227,So you even dodged my final attack...
SK0303,228,Heheh, nice one, Boss.
SK0303,229,Hahaha. Looks like I made it through without getting clocked.
SK0303,230,Yeah. Thanks for doin' this with me, Boss. Even though I kinda forced ya to...
SK0303,231,Why don't we take a quick break from that play?
SK0303,232,Yeah, let's do that. I'm still drenched with sweat.
SK0303,233,First, I'll duck!
SK0303,234,I've got you now! Take this! Leg sweep!!
SK0303,235,...Nice one, Boss. That was a great counter.
SK0303,236,I'm the one who should be praising you. You stopped my attack like it was nothing.
SK0303,237,Heheheh.
SK0303,238,Just what I expected from you, Boss! It's not every day I meet a man who can go toe to toe with me.
SK0303,239,Hahaha, thanks. Looks like I managed to retain my honor as a captain.
SK0303,240,Yeah. Thanks for doin' this with me, Boss. Even though I kinda forced ya to...
SK0303,241,Why don't we take a quick break from that play?
SK0303,242,Yeah, let's do that. I'm still drenched with sweat.
SK0303,243,I've gotta duck... and then jump!
SK0303,244,Hrraaaahhhh!!
SK0303,245,Gwaaaaahhhhhh!!
SK0303,246,(Umm, if there's an opening near her feet... Right, that means I should come from...)
SK0303,247,Hrraaaahhhh!!
SK0303,248,Gwaaaaahhhhhh!!
SK0303,249,I can't... take any more...
SK0303,250,...ss! Boss... You still with me?
SK0303,251,Uh...
SK0303,252,Hey, Boss, you all right?
SK0303,253,Y-Yeah... More or less...
SK0303,254,Haha... I guess you weren't just taking a vacation in Okinawa, were you.
SK0303,255,Heheh, sorry 'bout that. I got real amped up all of a sudden.
SK0303,256,How 'bout we rest for a bit. Here, grab my shoulder.
SK0303,257,Sorry, Kanna.
SK0303,258,Phew, we sure worked up a good sweat.
SK0303,259,How 'bout it, Boss? What do ya think of my karate progress over the past year?
SK0303,260,Hmm. You're still one hell of a martial artist, Kanna.
SK0303,261,I got a taste of those skills of yours firsthand.
SK0303,262,Ahaha! Sorry 'bout that. I got a bit carried away.
SK0303,263,You've improved quite a lot. I bet the training you went through to get this good was rigorous.
SK0303,264,Aw, n-nah... It wasn't nothin' special.
SK0303,265,But, I realized something while I was separated from all of you guys.
SK0303,266,Up till recently, the only thought in my head was how I wanted to get stronger, one way or another.
SK0303,267,The only thing my old man left me was my love of karate...
SK0303,268,All this time, I was trainin' just to be strong enough to reach his level. That was all I cared about.
SK0303,269,Yeah, I guess I only wanted to get stronger for myself in the end...
SK0303,270,...
SK0303,271,But not anymore. I dunno how to put this, really, but... I've got the Flower Division now.
SK0303,272,And the reason I wanna get stronger now is so I can lend everyone my power.
SK0303,273,Kanna...
SK0303,274,Heh, sorry Boss. Here I am blabbin' away at ya.
SK0303,275,Anyway, I'll be countin' on ya from here on out.
SK0303,276,Yeah, same here.
SK0303,277,Come to think of it, I wonder what's going on with that Sumire.
SK0303,278,Are you worried about her?
SK0303,279,Wh-What're you talkin' about?
SK0303,280,Kannaaa! We're still rehearsing! Where did you go?
SK0303,281,Ah, crap. We were in the middle of rehearsal, weren't we?
SK0303,282,I better go, Boss. Later!
SK0303,283,Kanna...
SK0303,284,Oh, there's somethin' I forgot to mention.
SK0303,285,What is it?
SK0303,286,The way you were sparrin' just now...
SK0303,287,You took a whole lotta hits head-on. You're usually better than that.
SK0303,288,Heh, not much of a Navy Ensign, are ya? You need to train a bit harder!
SK0303,289,Easy for you to say, your strength is on another level, Kanna.
SK0303,290,The way you were sparrin' with me earlier... You're pretty strong, Boss. Kinda makes me take a new look at ya.
SK0303,291,A-Anyways, see ya later!
SK0303,292,Kanna...
SK0303,293,At any rate, the entire Flower Division has some new pep in their step thanks to Kanna.
SK0303,294,If we can keep this up, I'm sure the summer production will go off without a hitch.
SK0303,295,It's this late already? Guess it's time for me to make the rounds for the night.
SK0303,296,Hm? Seems like a call's coming in.
SK0303,297,...
SK0303,298,Sumire, it's you. Why are you calling so late at night?
SK0303,299,Ensign...
SK0303,300,Between myself and the Imperial Assault Troupe, which is more important to you?
SK0303,301,Wh-What in the world? This came out of nowhere.
SK0303,302,Please, answer me, Ensign.
SK0303,303,Sumire...
SK0303,304,You are, Sumire.
SK0303,305,The Imperial Assault Troupe.
SK0303,306,I mean... Both are important to me. But if I had to, I'd choose you, Sumire.
SK0303,307,Ensign...
SK0303,308,I mean... Both are important to me. But if I had to, I'd choose the Imperial Assault Troupe.
SK0303,309,...
SK0303,310,Yes, of course. You are the Flower Division's captain, after all.
SK0303,311,...
SK0303,312,Sumire, you're important to me... and the Troupe is important to me, too.
SK0303,313,I really don't think I could ever choose between the two.
SK0303,314,Ensign...
SK0303,315,...
SK0303,316,Ah, E-Ensign...
SK0303,317,What is it? Is something wrong?
SK0303,318,...No, nothing at all.
SK0303,319,Well then, do pardon me.
SK0303,320,Hey, Sumire!
SK0303,321,...
SK0303,322,Ensign... Farewell.
SK0303,323,Hey, wait! Sumire!
SK0303,324,Farewell"? Why would she say that?
SK0303,325,Sorry Ogami, but each customer is only allowed to purchase one photo at a time.
SK0303,326,I see. That's too bad...
SK0303,327,I'm sorry, Ogami, but each customer is only allowed to purchase one photo at a time.
SK0303,328,Oh, really? That's too bad...

SK0304,1,I see you have gathered, my Five Black Demons.
SK0304,2,Are you out of your damn mind, Demon King?!
SK0304,3,If we've got time to meet up like this, we ought to be out there disposing of those fools!
SK0304,4,What a shameful display, Kongo. You've already lost once, so hold your tongue!
SK0304,5,Tch!!
SK0304,6,Fwohoho... Harsh as ever you are, Tsuchigumo...
SK0304,7,Still, that loss will by no means be in vain. All is within my calculations.
SK0304,8,Who cares about wins or losses, how we kill them is the real issue at hand.
SK0304,9,How fares Suiko?
SK0304,10,She has already taken up her post. And quite gracefully, indeed.
SK0304,11,I see...
SK0304,12,Now, as to the reason I have gathered you all here today...
SK0304,13,Through our master's influence, the Assault Troupe's financial backers have withdrawn their support.
SK0304,14,Hm, attacking the enemy's supply lines. A fitting way to dispose of the trash, wouldn't you say?
SK0304,15,Hah! What a cheap trick. How dull.
SK0304,16,Yet there are still those who would give them funding.
SK0304,17,Fwohoho... Even so, all remains within my calculations.
SK0304,18,All we need do is cut things off at the source. Do you not agree, Demon King?
SK0304,19,We must bring them down.
SK0304,20,Leave this task to me!
SK0304,21,Hmph! Your Dainichiken isn't even finished with repairs yet.
SK0304,22,Allow me to handle this one, as only I can.
SK0304,23,I'm fed up with chasing prey that tries to escape. Finding prey that will face you makes the hunt all the more fun!
SK0304,24,Very well... Go now, Tsuchigumo.
SK0304,25,Hey! The repairs for my Dainichiken are almost done, let me at 'em!
SK0304,26,Stand down, Kongo.
SK0304,27,Grr... Tch!
SK0304,28,Tsuchigumo, do not betray his expectations...
SK0304,29,Phew... Let's take five, everyone.
SK0304,30,We've been rehearsing nonstop since this morning. Prolly good to rest for a bit.
SK0304,31,Yes, you're right. Why don't we have some tea while we're at it?
SK0304,32,...
SK0304,33,What's up, Boss? You're lookin' a bit gloomy.
SK0304,34,(I wonder if I should tell the others about Sumire's call. Or...)
SK0304,35,Tell them about the call
SK0304,36,Change the subject
SK0304,37,Tell them about the call
SK0304,38,To tell the truth, I got a call from Sumire last night.
SK0304,39,Huh! What'd she wanna talk about?
SK0304,40,Well, I'm not too sure.
SK0304,41,She asked whether she or the Imperial Assault Troupe was more important to me, and then hung up suddenly after that.
SK0304,42,Hmmm, that's disturbing.
SK0304,43,Oh, Ensign! You are a man without a shred of tact within you!
SK0304,44,...I was thinking the same thing.
SK0304,45,I'm sure that was a conversation Sumire only wanted to have with you.
SK0304,46,Sharing it with the rest of us... That was over the line.
SK0304,47,I-I see... Sorry.
SK0304,48,I-It's nothing. I just had something on my mind, that's all.
SK0304,49,More importantly, your performance of King Lear is shaping up nicely, Kanna! I'm really impressed.
SK0304,50,O-Oh yeah? Aww, c'mon, you're gonna make me blush!
SK0304,51,(Phew, I think I managed to dodge the question.)
SK0304,52,(I think I should keep quiet about what happened last night.)
SK0304,53,...What's up, Boss?
SK0304,54,Sorry, it's nothing.
SK0304,55,Sheesh, you were quiet for a long time before answerin' the question.
SK0304,56,All right, now that we've had a bit of a break, let's get back into it.
SK0304,57,Right. Why don't we continue on with the second half of...
SK0304,58,Ogamiii! I've got some big news! This is serious!!
SK0304,59,Yuri? What kind of big news?
SK0304,60,Don't tell me some other horrible thing has happened...
SK0304,61,Well, I don't know whether it's a good thing or a bad thing.
SK0304,62,I only heard about it a moment ago.
SK0304,63,Apparently, Sumire is... getting married!!
SK0304,64,Huh?!
SK0304,65,Wh-What the hell?!
SK0304,66,Her suitor is the son of Viscount Makibishi.
SK0304,67,Apparently, if Sumire marries him, the Kanzaki Group will restore funding to the troupe.
SK0304,68,I see now. That's why she must have made that call yesterday!
SK0304,69,She called yesterday?
SK0304,70,I got a call from Sumire last night.
SK0304,71,She didn't say anything specific, but she seemed... off.
SK0304,72,Sumire...
SK0304,73,Damn it, what a load of crap!
SK0304,74,That dumbass... Sumire must be plannin' to give herself up to save the troupe by doin' this.
SK0304,75,Boss, what should we do?
SK0304,76,Let's go rescue Sumire!
SK0304,77,Let's go congratulate Sumire!
SK0304,78,Isn't it obvious? We have to go rescue Sumire!
SK0304,79,If she's being married against her will, we've got to put a stop to it!
SK0304,80,Now that's what I'm talkin' about!
SK0304,81,I'll come as well!
SK0304,82,Poor Sumire! I wanna go save her, too!
SK0304,83,No doubt this will be interesting. You may count me in!
SK0304,84,At the very least, it would be best not to let her be married off to some Japanese man.
SK0304,85,You should come too, Reni!
SK0304,86,I will go if ordered to.
SK0304,87,If we retrieve her, it will strengthen the Flower Division's fighting capabilities.
SK0304,88,OK, everyone! We're off to the Kanzaki estate!
SK0304,89,All right! Heheh, I'm itchin' to get started.
SK0304,90,This is great news! We should go congratulate Sumire, everyone!
SK0304,91,What the hell're you sayin' Boss?!
SK0304,92,That isn't funny, Mon Frère!
SK0304,93,Do you have any idea at all how Sumire must feel, Ogami?!
SK0304,94,Come on now, Sakura. You must know that all Japanese men are this way deep down.
SK0304,95,We gotta go rescue Sumire, you guys. And then there's somethin' we gotta tell her:
SK0304,96,We're gonna protect the troupe with our own strength!
SK0304,97,All right, time for our assault on the Kanzaki estate! Better not dawdle, Boss, or we'll leave ya behind!
SK0304,98,Uh... W-Wait a sec!
SK0304,99,...
SK0304,100,Boss, with things bein' how they are, I get you wantin' to be careful.
SK0304,101,We don't know for sure whether gettin' married is really what Sumire wants.
SK0304,102,But there's one thing I am sure of: there's no way her heart's in this!
SK0304,103,If she was excited about gettin' hitched, you know she'd be over here braggin' about it to us!
SK0304,104,I see...
SK0304,105,We gotta go rescue Sumire, Boss. And then there's somethin' we gotta tell her:
SK0304,106,We're gonna protect the troupe with our own strength!
SK0304,107,All right. Everyone, let's head for the Kanzaki estate!
SK0304,108,All right! Heheh, I'm itchin' to get started.
SK0304,109,...
SK0304,110,...Yes.
SK0304,111,My lady, Lord Makibishi has arrived.
SK0304,112,He, as well as Lord Shigeki and Lady Hinako have been awaiting you in the banquet room for some time.
SK0304,113,Very well. Please tell them... I will be along shortly.
SK0304,114,As you wish.
SK0304,115,...Miyata, what are your feelings on this marriage interview?
SK0304,116,The only wish I have is for your happiness, Lady Sumire.
SK0304,117,I would ask that you cease that dangerous line of work.
SK0304,118,That way, you may seek your own happiness.
SK0304,119,...
SK0304,120,Now then, if you would please excuse me.
SK0304,121,...
SK0304,122,Ensign...
SK0304,123,So this is Sumire's family home, the Kanzaki estate.
SK0304,124,Goodness, this is an enormous house.
SK0304,125,Tch. Figures the gate would be shut.
SK0304,126,Hmm, all right...
SK0304,127,Call for someone.
SK0304,128,Force it open.
SK0304,129,Come back later.
SK0304,130,Excuse me! Is anyone there?
SK0304,131,O-Ogami, just what are you trying to do?
SK0304,132,Unnf... Yeah, this isn't opening.
SK0304,133,Hm, I guess there's nothing we can do. Let's come back later.
SK0304,134,What the hell are you talking about?!
SK0304,135,Sumire might be gettin' married off while we're standin' around here!
SK0304,136,So you've come after all, esteemed members of the Imperial Assault Troupe.
SK0304,137,...!
SK0304,138,Do pardon me for speaking with you through the gate. I am Kyosei Miyata, butler to the Kanzaki household.
SK0304,139,Open up the gate, mister! Me and my friends wanna go see Sumire!
SK0304,140,A thousand pardons, but I'm afraid I must refuse your request to meet with Lady Sumire.
SK0304,141,Today is of momentous importance to Lady Sumire. Therefore, I cannot allow any interruptions to occur!
SK0304,142,If you are so insistent upon meeting with her, why not break through this gate and stroll on inside?
SK0304,143,Heh! You're gonna regret those words, gramps!
SK0304,144,(Is she... planning to break down the gate?)
SK0304,145,Stop her.
SK0304,146,Spur her on.
SK0304,147,Kanna, violence is not the answer here!
SK0304,148,We came here to bring Sumire back, that's all.
SK0304,149,If we destroyed the gate, it would cause a lot more trouble than we bargained for.
SK0304,150,That's easy enough to say, but then how're we supposed to get this gate open?
SK0304,151,Hmm...
SK0304,152,...! What the?!
SK0304,153,The gate, it opened!
SK0304,154,Mon Frère, let's go inside!
SK0304,155,Wait. It could be a trap.
SK0304,156,Wh-What? Why has the gate been opened?!
SK0304,157,If he's acting that way, then it probably isn't a trap.
SK0304,158,All right, guys! Time to storm the Kanzaki estate!
SK0304,159,How did the gate open from the inside?
SK0304,160,If you wait long enough, the weather will be clear enough to go by sea!" Isn't that what they say, Ogami?
SK0304,161,K-Kayama! Why in the world are you here?!
SK0304,162,But of course, in the literal sense it means that good things come to those who wait.
SK0304,163,I myself am as the sun, shining upon the ocean blue! Hahahaha!
SK0304,164,K-Kayama...
SK0304,165,Go on now, Ogami. Sumire is awaiting you.
SK0304,166,And now, I shall fly away with the early summer's breeze. Farewell to you, Ogami!
SK0304,167,Kayama... What the heck is with that guy?
SK0304,168,Boss, hurry up and let's go in!
SK0304,169,Right. Now's not the time for that. We've got to hurry!
SK0304,170,Desperate times call for desperate measures. Kanna, break this thing down!
SK0304,171,Leave it to me!
SK0304,172,One strike's all it'll take. Lemme show you the results of my training!
SK0304,173,Hrrraaahhhhh!
SK0304,174,There we go!
SK0304,175,W-Whoa...
SK0304,176,Un... Unbelievable! The Kanzaki estate's front gate, how can this be?!
SK0304,177,Heheh, so you've finally had a taste of the power of a single kick from the great Kanna Kirishima, eh?
SK0304,178,The way forward's open, you guys. Let's go!
SK0304,179,Right!
SK0304,180,OK, time to infiltrate the Kanzaki estate!
SK0304,181,We ain't got time for this, Boss. Lemme handle this.
SK0304,182,K-Kanna, hang on!
SK0304,183,Hrrraaahhhhh!
SK0304,184,There we go!
SK0304,185,Well, she sure handled it.
SK0304,186,Un... Unbelievable! The Kanzaki estate's front gate, how can this be?!
SK0304,187,Heheh, so you've finally had a taste of the power of a single kick from the great Kanna Kirishima, eh?
SK0304,188,The way forward's open, you guys. Let's go!
SK0304,189,Right!
SK0304,190,Guess there's nothing else to do but to dash in.
SK0304,191,OK, everyone. Time to infiltrate the Kanzaki estate!
SK0304,192,Whoa, this is one big house, all right.
SK0304,193,And Sumire is somewhere in there right now.
SK0304,194,Yeah. Let's not waste any time.
SK0304,195,Ah, there they are! That horde of ruffians are right over there! After them!
SK0304,196,Damn, we're surrounded!
SK0304,197,Run towards the entrance.
SK0304,198,Fight.
SK0304,199,Everyone, run! Make for the entrance!
SK0304,200,Y-Yes, sir!
SK0304,201,We'll have to fight them off to have a chance at stopping Sumire's marriage.
SK0304,202,Right, leave it to me!
SK0304,203,Boss, get your head outta the clouds if you don't wanna get clobbered!
SK0304,204,Uh, right...
SK0304,205,Don't mind getting your hands a little dirty! Do whatever you must to stop these hooligans in their tracks!
SK0304,206,That's a laugh! All right, if ya think you can stop us, then just try it!
SK0304,207,Haaaaaahh! Take THIS!!
SK0304,208,That all ya got? C'mon, who's next?!
SK0304,209,Nghh... Come now, what are you lot doing? Keep going, don't stop now!
SK0304,210,Damn, they just keep on coming...
SK0304,211,...! Boss, behind you!
SK0304,212,Crap!!
SK0304,213,They're comin' at you from above! You gotta dodge!!
SK0304,214,Guard your head!
SK0304,215,Guard your abdomen!
SK0304,216,Duck!
SK0304,217,Guard your head!
SK0304,218,Guard your abdomen!
SK0304,219,From above, I should guard my head!
SK0304,220,Yes, I stopped it!
SK0304,221,Nice one, Boss!
SK0304,222,Thanks! Our sparring match yesterday came in handy!
SK0304,223,Do not falter now! Keep it up, for the sake of Lady Sumire!
SK0304,224,I'll guard my abdomen!
SK0304,225,Gwaahhh!
SK0304,226,What the heck, Boss? Didja forget everything we did during sparring yesterday?!
SK0304,227,Nicely done! Keep it up, for the sake of Lady Sumire!
SK0304,228,An attack from above? I'd better duck!
SK0304,229,Yes, I dodged it!
SK0304,230,Good one, Boss! I knew ya could do it!
SK0304,231,Thanks! Our sparring match yesterday came in handy!
SK0304,232,Do not falter now! Keep it up, for the sake of Lady Sumire!
SK0304,233,Uhh... If they're coming from above, then I'm supposed to... What was it...
SK0304,234,Gwaahhh!
SK0304,235,What the heck, Boss? Didja forget everything we did during sparring yesterday?!
SK0304,236,Nicely done! Keep it up, for the sake of Lady Sumire!
SK0304,237,Damn, these bastards got no sense of honor at all!
SK0304,238,The way things are going, we don't have time for this!
SK0304,239,Ogami! Kanna!
SK0304,240,Leave this to the rest of us! You two go on ahead!
SK0304,241,B-But, if it's only you guys...
SK0304,242,I would ask you not to underestimate me!
SK0304,243,Defeating a mere Japanese man is as simple as eating a piece of cake.
SK0304,244,I get stronger when I'm mad, you know!
SK0304,245,We should have no trouble defeating enemies of this rank.
SK0304,246,Nngh! There are only six of them! Is that the best you can do?!
SK0304,247,Call for reinforcements! We must not allow them to pass through!
SK0304,248,Ogami, hurry! Before their reinforcements arrive!
SK0304,249,Everyone...
SK0304,250,We'll leave this to you!
SK0304,251,No, we'll stay here.
SK0304,252,We'll leave this to you!
SK0304,253,Go easy on them.
SK0304,254,No, we'll stay here.
SK0304,255,Sakura, Iris, Orihime, Reni! We'll leave this to you all!
SK0304,256,The two of us will go after Sumire instead!
SK0304,257,Right!
SK0304,258,Do your best, Mon Frère!
SK0304,259,...
SK0304,260,If you have the time to bark orders, then you have the time to be running!
SK0304,261,Kanna, let's go!
SK0304,262,Right!
SK0304,263,Go a bit easy on them, everyone.
SK0304,264,Otherwise they might give us some nasty medical bills to pay back later.
SK0304,265,Hahaha! Right, understood!
SK0304,266,Ensign and Kanna, you should take care as well! Make sure you do not break any buildings along the way.
SK0304,267,Hahaha! If I'm bein' honest, that's the one thing I ain't too confident about.
SK0304,268,Well, since we won't have any money after losin' all our financial backin' anyway, we better be real careful.
SK0304,269,OK, let's go, Kanna.
SK0304,270,Right!
SK0304,271,No, we'll stay here. We can't just leave you all behind.
SK0304,272,You dumbass, what're you talkin' about?!
SK0304,273,If we don't get a move on, Sumire's really gonna get married off!
SK0304,274,We don't got time to play around with these small fries! We gotta go straight for the prize!
SK0304,275,Kanna's right, Ogami!
SK0304,276,You're the only one who can save Sumire. So please, hurry!
SK0304,277,...All right. We'll leave this to you all.
SK0304,278,OK, let's go, Kanna.
SK0304,279,Right!
SK0304,280,Boss, what're you doin' just starin' into space at a time like this?!
SK0304,281,If we don't get a move on, Sumire's really gonna get married off!
SK0304,282,We don't got time to play around with these small fries! We gotta go straight for the prize!
SK0304,283,Kanna's right, Ogami!
SK0304,284,You're the only one who can save Sumire. So please, hurry!
SK0304,285,...All right. We'll leave this to you all.
SK0304,286,OK, let's go, Kanna.
SK0304,287,Right!
SK0304,288,This must be the entrance. We've finally reached the main house.
SK0304,289,...Yep, it's locked all right.
SK0304,290,Heheh. So what now, Boss?
SK0304,291,We've got no choice. Go ahead, Kanna.
SK0304,292,Yep, leave it to me!
SK0304,293,Heheh. Man, this entryway alone musta cost a fortune.
SK0304,294,Well, in we go. Hoo boy, the inside of this place is just as fancy.
SK0304,295,...Good, looks like there's no one inside.
SK0304,296,Let's get a move on, Boss. We gotta find out which room Sumire's marriage interview is taking place in.
SK0304,297,This really is an enormous house. Just where could Sumire be?
SK0304,298,Ehn? Hang on a sec.
SK0304,299,Hey, Boss... Looks like your finger's bleedin'.
SK0304,300,Oh, you're right. Maybe I injured it during the fight back there.
SK0304,301,Sheesh, guess I gotta do this. C'mon, gimme your hand...
SK0304,302,Kanna...
SK0304,303,Heheh, just leave this to me.
SK0304,304,Here we go... Ahaha, wait. I think I messed up the wrapping a bit. Looks kinda weird.
SK0304,305,I wrap up my own wounds all the time, but it's hard doin' it on someone else.
SK0304,306,Thank you, Kanna.
SK0304,307,You are kinda bad at this.
SK0304,308,Thank you, Kanna. I... appreciate you taking care of me like this.
SK0304,309,Aw, c'mon, Boss. No need to make a big deal of it, you're gonna make me blush.
SK0304,310,Hahaha, you are kinda bad at this, aren't you, Kanna?
SK0304,311,Aw, c'mon! That's kinda rude to say, ain't it?
SK0304,312,Hahaha. Sorry, sorry.
SK0304,313,Still, I'm not even any good at tellin' other people about how I feel...
SK0304,314,Hm? Did you say something?
SK0304,315,Uh... N-Nope! D-Didn't say a thing. Hahahaha!
SK0304,316,But hey, even if it ain't that pretty, it'll still do the job, yeah?
SK0304,317,Yeah, it's wrapped nice and tight.
SK0304,318,...
SK0304,319,...
SK0304,320,Man, it's kinda... tense in here, eh? Hahaha.
SK0304,321,Y-Yeah... It sure is.
SK0304,322,All right, let's get movin'. We better hurry before Sumire gets married off for real.
SK0304,323,Yeah. It's almost time for the decisive showdown.
SK0304,324,Heheh, that's right! It'll be our final battle.
SK0304,325,Right. Let's go, Kanna!
SK0304,326,...
SK0304,327,...
SK0304,328,Don't just sit there silently, Sumire. Say something.
SK0304,329,...
SK0304,330,Sumire, your grandfather is right.
SK0304,331,Now, dear. There's no need for that...
SK0304,332,Sumire, if you don't at least try speaking to him, you won't learn anything about him.
SK0304,333,Lord Makibishi, are you truly all right with this? With things being decided without your input?
SK0304,334,W-Well, I-
SK0304,335,Young master Makibishi, you have no objections, do you?
SK0304,336,...
SK0304,337,Wh-Why, of course not!
SK0304,338,Yoichiro would be fortunate indeed to be wed to the fair young Lady Kanzaki!
SK0304,339,Now that young master Makibishi's wishes have been made known... What say you, Sumire?
SK0304,340,I... I...
SK0304,341,Wait just a damn minute!
SK0304,342,...!! That voice, it couldn't be?!
SK0304,343,Who are you people?
SK0304,344,I am Captain Ichiro Ogami of the Imperial Assault Troupe, Flower Division!
SK0304,345,And I'm Kanna Kirishima, also from the Flower Division!
SK0304,346,Ensign... and Kanna...
SK0304,347,Sumire...
SK0304,348,Sumire...
SK0304,349,Hoh, so you are Ogami, then. All this fuss, I presume you must know who I am, then?
SK0304,350,Surely you have not come here in order to embarrass me...
SK0304,351,...Tadayoshi Kanzaki, who has financed the troupe's activities for so many years?
SK0304,352,No. And the troupe is eternally grateful for the support you've given us.
SK0304,353,But this is a completely separate matter!
SK0304,354,I must object to Sumire being forced into a marriage she doesn't want!
SK0304,355,That's right, gramps! If you think things're gonna go just how you wanted, you're in for a rude awakening!
SK0304,356,Fu... Fwahahaha! Such bravado! I suppose I should expect as much, since you've come all this way.
SK0304,357,But Ogami, what would you say to this?
SK0304,358,You are aware that the troupe's financiers are pulling back their funding, are you not?
SK0304,359,...Yes.
SK0304,360,If you agree to leave peaceably right now, I will see to it that your funding is restored.
SK0304,361,However, if you take Sumire with you, you understand what will happen, yes?
SK0304,362,Grandfather!
SK0304,363,That's low, old man!
SK0304,364,Be silent, women!
SK0304,365,...
SK0304,366,...
SK0304,367,Now then, what will you do, Ogami?
SK0304,368,We're taking Sumire back.
SK0304,369,I can't make this decision myself.
SK0304,370,I understand.
SK0304,371,We're taking Sumire back with us.
SK0304,372,Ensign!
SK0304,373,Boss!
SK0304,374,I... can't make this decision myself. There's too much riding on it.
SK0304,375,B-Boss, what the hell're you saying?!
SK0304,376,...
SK0304,377,You said it yourself, didn't you, Boss?! No matter how tough things might be, we gotta do this with our own strength!
SK0304,378,Sumire's an important part of the Flower Division!
SK0304,379,...Yes. You're absolutely right, Kanna.
SK0304,380,We're taking Sumire back with us!
SK0304,381,Right...
SK0304,382,Is that so? Are you truly all right with following along with the captain's decision?
SK0304,383,Any decision he makes becomes the will of the Imperial Assault Troupe itself.
SK0304,384,Very well. As Deputy Commander of the Imperial Assault Troupe, I approve of this decision.
SK0304,385,Kaede... Fujieda?!
SK0304,386,So you're Ogami. You're exactly how my sister described you.
SK0304,387,Huh? Ayame... talked about me?
SK0304,388,Fwahahaha! How amusing.
SK0304,389,To think, the Imperial Assault Troupe would go so far for the sake of a single member.
SK0304,390,Grandfather. I... I'm returning to the Imperial Assault Troupe.
SK0304,391,Were I not to go with them, I am certain I would regret it later.
SK0304,392,Sumire!
SK0304,393,Very well. Take Sumire with you, then.
SK0304,394,However, the Kanzaki Group will no longer provide any funding to the Imperial Assault Troupe. Will you accept this?
SK0304,395,Yes! We will continue on, using our own power!
SK0304,396,What is that sound?
SK0304,397,Could it be... the enemy?!
SK0304,398,It seems so.
SK0304,399,But there is no need to worry. We were aware that the enemy planned to attack this area.
SK0304,400,You knew?!
SK0304,401,Your Koubu are all onboard the Soaring Whale, Sumire's included.
SK0304,402,Now, let us depart!
SK0304,403,All right, Boss! We gotta drive any enemies outta the mansion!
SK0304,404,There are still a fair number of people in the estate's garden. Evacuating them should be our first priority.
SK0304,405,Let's take care of the enemies first!
SK0304,406,Ensuring civilians' safety takes priority!
SK0304,407,Let's take care of the enemies first! We should eliminate any enemies on the grounds of the Kanzaki estate!
SK0304,408,Then it should be safe to start evacuating people.
SK0304,409,Ensuring civilians' safety takes priority! Don't allow even a single enemy to approach the grounds of the estate!
SK0304,410,We need to wait until everyone is safely evacuated before engaging the enemy!
SK0304,411,Sumire, wait!
SK0304,412,Father, Mother, I'm going now.
SK0304,413,Sumire...
SK0304,414,...
SK0304,415,It's all right, Sumire.
SK0304,416,Darling, if there's something that is truly precious to you...
SK0304,417,...then you should live as you wish, without any regard to the Kanzaki name.
SK0304,418,Yes. Sumire, I want you to know that I love you very much.
SK0304,419,Father... Mother...
SK0304,420,I'm going now, because that is what I wish to do! And...
SK0304,421,I will fight for the sake of everything I hold dear!
SK0304,422,That is how I wish to live!
SK0304,423,Heheh. Y'know, Sumire, it's been a while since ya went out on a mission. Ya better not get in my way!
SK0304,424,And I would ask that you take care not to destroy my home with that brutish strength of yours.
SK0304,425,OK, let's go! The others are waiting for us!
SK0304,426,Sorry Ogami, but each customer is only allowed to purchase one photo at a time.
SK0304,427,I see. That's too bad...
SK0304,428,I'm sorry, Ogami. I can only sell one photo at a time to the same person.
SK0304,429,Oh, really? That's too bad...

SK0304,473,A scarf given to me by Sakura. It's knitted with yellow yarn - my favorite color.
SK0306,1,Allow me to introduce myself. I am Kaede Fujieda. From today on, I've been appointed Deputy Commander of the Imperial Assault Troupe.
SK0306,2,My sister, Ayame, organized and assisted the Imperial Assault Troupe...
SK0306,3,...and now it's my turn to take care of it in her stead.
SK0306,4,I'm looking forward to working with everyone.
SK0306,5,Y-Yes, ma'am! W-We'll be in your care!
SK0306,6,Jeez, Ogami... You're always blushing in front of a beautiful woman!!
SK0306,7,Ogami, Ogami! We just got big news!!
SK0306,8,What is it, Yuri? And Kasumi's with you too. Did something else happen this time!?
SK0306,9,The manager... It seems that Mr. Yoneda has regained consciousness!
SK0306,10,For real!? Are you serious!?
SK0306,11,Uncle Yoneda is doing OK? Yaaay! Yaaay!
SK0306,12,Thank goodness, Ogami. Now the Imperial Assault Troupe can get back to normal.
SK0306,13,Yeah! And Kaede has become our deputy commander.
SK0306,14,From now on, we can live through any crisis no matter what!
SK0306,15,OK, now let's visit Mr. Yoneda at the hospital!
SK0306,16,Manager Yoneda was smiling and full of life when we visited him in the army hospital.
SK0306,17,He was so cheerful that it's hard to believe that he just got out of a coma. It was a miracle, and quite the relief to us all.
SK0306,18,The doctors said he can be discharged after another two months.
SK0306,19,That said, those two months might be hard for him since no alcohol's allowed in the hospital.
SK0306,20,And finally... The theater's summer performance of "King Lear" began.
SK0306,21,I felt like I had worked my fingers to the bone after punching tickets for so long.
SK0306,22,This job is unexpectedly exhausting...
SK0306,23,But hearing the storm of applause from where I stand in the entrance, washes away all my fatigue.
SK0306,24,Audiences gave "King Lear" more support than we expected.
SK0306,25,With Kanna as King Lear, Sakura as the kind-hearted Princess Cordelia...
SK0306,26,Orihime standing on our stage for the first time...
SK0306,27,And of course, Sumire as the scheming Princess Goneril trying to ensnare the king.
SK0306,28,I guess Kanna and Sumire's performances were the crowd's favorite.
SK0306,29,I could tell because the ovation wouldn't stop, even after the curtain came down.
SK0306,30,I believe that we can overcome any obstacles, as long as everyone in Flower Division works together.
SK0306,31,As the top star on this stage, this kind of applause is normal!
SK0306,32,Hey, hey, just because you got the main role, doesn't mean you can brag much! You wanna fight!?
SK0306,33,If you so wish!
SK0306,34,Above anything else, all ends well... I think?

SK0401,2,It really is summer now, isn't it?
SK0401,3,You seem to be doing fine in this heat, Sakura.
SK0401,4,Hehe. It's my summer dress, Ogami. Do I look good in this?
SK0401,5,It suits you.
SK0401,6,I like your usual clothes more.
SK0401,7,It fits you well. It's a nice change of pace from your usual clothing.
SK0401,8,Thank you very much. I'm... glad you like it, Ogami.
SK0401,9,It was worth it trying this outfit.
SK0401,10,Hm, I like the clothes that you usually wear more.
SK0401,11,Japanese-style clothes suit you better, in my opinion.
SK0401,12,I see. After I decided to try this one out... That's too bad.
SK0401,13,S-Sorry, I don't really know much about women's clothes.
SK0401,14,Ah, I-I'm sorry, Ogami. I didn't mean to confuse you.
SK0401,15,But, I had a feeling that you would say something like that, hehe.

SK0401,17,Arf, arf!
SK0401,18,Oh?
SK0401,19,Arf!
SK0401,20,Oh, what a cute puppy! That's a good boy.
SK0401,21,He's not wearing a collar, must be a stray.
SK0401,22,Arf!
SK0401,23,Ah, he ran away.
SK0401,24,That was a cute puppy. It would be nice if we could keep it at the theater.
SK0401,25,Ah!!
SK0401,26,(Oh no! That car's not slowing down!)
SK0401,27,Aaahh, the puppy!!
SK0401,28,Ugh!
SK0401,29,I gotta jump and save him!

SK0401,42,Are you OK, Ogami, the puppy!?
SK0401,43,W-We're OK. Sort of...
SK0401,44,Seems that jumping out onto the road was the best way to save him.
SK0401,45,Ow... Did I just sprain my leg? I landed in a weird position after that jump.
SK0401,46,Oof...
SK0401,47,Hahaha, you can thank me for that.
SK0401,48,Thank goodness, neither of you are hurt too bad.
SK0401,49,Hey!
SK0401,50,How dare you jump out in front of our car!! What's your problem!?
SK0401,51,What would you have done if we got hurt? You better answer carefully!
SK0401,52,I had to... You would have run over this dog at the speed you were driving.
SK0401,53,What!? Are you saying that the life of that mutt is more important that our own lives!?
SK0401,54,Would you stop it?! You're being rude!
SK0401,55,You bastards... How dare you talk like that in front of Imperial soldiers.
SK0401,56,I can tell from your rank you're a commissioned officer in the army, aren't you?
SK0401,57,So, you're also military, huh? Give me your name and rank?
SK0401,58,Ensign Ichiro Ogami, Imperial Navy! 
SK0401,59,I don't need to tell it to guys like you!
SK0401,60,I'm Ensign Ichiro Ogami, Imperial Navy! 
SK0401,61,Aha... Ichiro Ogami, huh? I've heard your name before.
SK0401,62,You're the captain of that garbage unit full of women. The "Imperial Assault Troupe." 
SK0401,63,What did you just say!?
SK0401,64,I don't need to tell it to guys like you!
SK0401,65,You bastard! What did you just say!?
SK0401,66,Wait... I recognize your face.
SK0401,67,You're Ichiro Ogami, the captain of that garbage unit full of women. The "Imperial Assault Troupe."
SK0401,68,...
SK0401,69,...
SK0401,70,Answer my question, bastard!!
SK0401,71,Wait... I recognize your face.
SK0401,72,You're Ichiro Ogami, the captain of that garbage unit full of women. The "Imperial Assault Troupe."
SK0401,73,...
SK0401,74,Going out and chatting away with a woman in the middle of the day... 
SK0401,75,Moreover, you're blocking our way! Disgraceful!!
SK0401,76,For all you've done, you deserve corporal punishment. It's bastards like you that are ruining this country.
SK0401,77,W-What!? What are you going to do to Ogami!?
SK0401,78,Grit your teeth, "Captain."
SK0401,79,Resist.
SK0401,80,I haven't done anything wrong. Hit me and I'll hit you back!
SK0401,81,Oho... If you make a big scene out of this, it'll become an even larger mess between the Army and the Navy. 
SK0401,82,(Ugh, he's right. Fighting over this stuff will just make things worse since Manager Yoneda is absent.)
SK0401,83,Finally made your decision? Good, now take this!
SK0401,84,Ogami! I've got your back!!
SK0401,85,Sakura, wait! If this gets any uglier, it'll just cause a massive incident between the Army and the Navy.
SK0401,86,Commander Yoneda is still absent, too. It'll just make things even worse for us.
SK0401,87,Ogami...
SK0401,88,Heh, what a complete idiot! We're leaving!!
SK0401,89,...
SK0401,90,What an insolent bastard! Salute the Minister of the Army, His Excellency, Keigo Kyogoku! 
SK0401,91,Keigo... Kyougoku?
SK0401,92,So you're Ensign Ichiro Ogami.
SK0401,93,You got yourself a pair of nice piercing eyes.
SK0401,94,...
SK0401,95,And you... You resemble your father quite a bit, Sakura Shinguji.
SK0401,96,Huh!? So you... You knew my father?
SK0401,97,Yes. What a pathetic person he was. I'm sure that right now...
SK0401,98,...he's regretting everything in the afterlife. He died like a fool, all for nothing.
SK0401,99,What!?
SK0401,100,Hold it, Sakura!
SK0401,101,I hope that you won't throw your life away like your father did.
SK0401,102,Please, make wiser decisions while you still live, Sakura Shinguji.
SK0401,103,H-How can you say that!?
SK0401,104,Excuse us for now.
SK0401,105,Stop right there!!
SK0401,106,Sakura!
SK0401,107,Unacceptable. He just mocked my father. I absolutely will not let that stand!
SK0401,108,Sakura...
SK0401,109,Ogami, are you hurt?
SK0401,110,I'm fine, it's not a big deal.
SK0401,111,But that bruise...
SK0401,112,Oh, this? That's from when I rescued the puppy. It's not a big deal.
SK0401,113,Ogami...
SK0401,114,To not let that fight escalate, I think your attitude there was admirable, Ogami.
SK0401,115,Hahaha, thanks.
SK0401,116,Sakura, let's keep what just happened earlier a secret and not tell the manager.
SK0401,117,Huh? B-But...
SK0401,118,I don't want to make him worry about unnecessary things.
SK0401,119,Ogami...
SK0401,120,Let's go inside the manager's room.
SK0401,121,Our apologies, Commander. If only we weren't so careless, such a thing wouldn't have happened to you.
SK0401,122,Hm? I just heard something. Sounds like there's someone in his room.
SK0401,123,No need to worry about it. Even I wouldn't have expected to get shot in such a place.
SK0401,124,Guess I was just too stubborn to die. Wahahahaha!
SK0401,125,You can go back to your job now. Don't dwell on what happened.
SK0401,126,Understood. I shall return to my duties. Please, excuse me for now.
SK0401,127,Damn it, to let such a thing happen to him while I was around.
SK0401,128,Kayama, is that you?
SK0401,129,Uwooooah! O-Ogami!?
SK0401,130,M-My, Ogami! The beach sounds great, wouldn't you say? When it comes to summer, it's the place to be!
SK0401,131,You're right, it does sounds great.
SK0401,132,What were you doing with the manager?
SK0401,133,You're right, it does sounds great.
SK0401,134,What were you doing with the manager?
SK0401,135,But we're at the hospital.
SK0401,136,The beach during the summer, huh? That sure does sound great.
SK0401,137,R-Right, Ogami! Swimming in the ocean is the ideal summer hot spot!
SK0401,138,Ah, to have a friend who gets me just makes me so happy.
SK0401,139,Were you talking with the manager just now?
SK0401,140,W-Wha... We were just talking about work.
SK0401,141,Work? Come to think of it, what do you do for work?
SK0401,142,O-Oh, come on now. Don't worry yourself over the little details.
SK0401,143,Hey, wait a minute, Kayama. I'm not at the beach, this is the hospital.
SK0401,144,Urk...
SK0401,145,Th-The hospital is also a great place to be! Ah, the smell of disinfectants give me such joy.
SK0401,146,Wh-What's with you...
SK0401,147,What, Ogami? Don't you agree with that statement?
SK0401,148,I don't know how to answer when you suddenly start talking about the ocean.
SK0401,149,Hahaha, you're a lost cause. At this rate, you're gonna lose your title as a Navy Ensign, Ogami!
SK0401,150,W-Well then, I must be going.
SK0401,151,Tell the manager to get well soon. "Even health can come from a peace of the mind." Farewell!
SK0401,152,Shouldn't that be "health comes from peace of mind"?
SK0401,153,What a funny person. Kayama, wasn't it?
SK0401,154,Well, he definitely is funny.
SK0401,155,Well, let's go inside.
SK0401,156,Oh, you two.
SK0401,157,Good afternoon, Mr. Yoneda.
SK0401,158,How do you feel right now, sir?
SK0401,159,Heh, these wounds are nothing to me.
SK0401,160,But, the blasted doctor just keeps confining me to my bed.
SK0401,161,Then... Has there been any news about when you'll be discharged?
SK0401,162,Ah... I may be able to leave next month.
SK0401,163,I see. In any case, please take care of yourself.
SK0401,164,By the way, Ogami... What's with the bruises? You get into a fight?
SK0401,165,Ah, t-this is... I just tripped and fell over while we were walking here.
SK0401,166,Uh-huh... Now that's suspicious. Did you got caught two-timing, Chief?
SK0401,167,Huh!?
SK0401,168,Yoohoo!! Been forever since I saw you guys. You all doin' good?
SK0401,169,Kohran!!
SK0401,170,Oh, Kohran! Don't you still have work to do at Hanayashiki?
SK0401,171,My work over there finally calmed down. Now I can return to the theater.
SK0401,172,So I figured I oughta visit Mr. Yoneda on my way back.
SK0401,173,Heh, you guys just keep coming, even though I'm doing perfectly fine here.
SK0401,174,So, Chief, are you sure nothing happened to you? Your handsome face is all messed up. 
SK0401,175,...
SK0401,176,...
SK0401,177,Sorry, Ogami, but I can't stay silent any more.
SK0401,178,Sakura!
SK0401,179,Mr. Yoneda... Do you know Keigo Kyogoku, the Minister of the Army?
SK0401,180,Oh, I know him. Something happen with him?
SK0401,181,Yes. We actually had a quarrel with his suboordinates earlier.
SK0401,182,Ogami didn't want the scuffle to get worse, so he stayed silent and let them punch him.
SK0401,183,...
SK0401,184,I see, so that's what happened.
SK0401,185,Keigo Kyogoku is a man who reached the position of Minister of the Army at a young age.
SK0401,186,Advocating radical militarist ideology, even though the public called for disarmament.
SK0401,187,It's this talk and ideology that led him to gain support among a lot of the like-minded younger officers in the army.
SK0401,188,Well, you held yourself well out there, Ogami. That's brave of you.
SK0401,189,The wealthy don't fight"... Oh, but we don't have money, do we? Hahaha-- Ow, ow, ow. 
SK0401,190,But I cannot let what he said stand. He dared to speak ill of my father!
SK0401,191,So, he said something about Kazuma, too.
SK0401,192,Well, we'll need to endure it for awhile. We can't afford to get provoked by their taunting. Got it?
SK0401,193,But...
SK0401,194,Oops, it's time for the doctors to check up on me.
SK0401,195,Sorry you had to suffer so much just to see me today, eh?
SK0401,196,N-No, not a problem at all.
SK0401,197,I'm fine, you can go home now. I'll just drink some sake in peace after all this.
SK0401,198,Don't go overboard, Mr. Yoneda. You're still injured. See ya next time!
SK0401,199,Excuse us then, sir.
SK0401,200,'Kay... Wait, Ogami. You stay here for a bit. I need to talk to you about something.
SK0401,201,R-Right.
SK0401,202,...
SK0401,203,What is it you wanted to talk to me about, Mr. Yoneda?
SK0401,204,The thing is, I want you to take care of this thing for me.
SK0401,205,T-This is...
SK0401,206,This is my beloved sword that's been with me through thick and thin since the Kouma War... The Divine Blade Mekkyaku.
SK0401,207,Such an important thing...
SK0401,208,I will take care of it.
SK0401,209,I'm not taking it.
SK0401,210,Is there a reason?
SK0401,211,Understood. I will take the utmost care of the Divine Blade Mekkyaku. 
SK0401,212,OK, Ogami. I'm counting on you.
SK0401,213,I... I won't take it. For warriors, a sword equals its wielder's life.
SK0401,214,It makes me feel like you're giving me this sword to remember you by.
SK0401,215,Remember me!? I'm not dying here, you idiot!
SK0401,216,I'm just asking you to take care of it is all. Now quit your grumbling and take it!!
SK0401,217,O-OK. Understood. I'll take care of it.
SK0401,218,Is there any reason as to why? Why are you entrusting me with a sword that's so important to you? 
SK0401,219,You're right, it is important to me. That's precisely why I'm entrusting this to someone I can trust.
SK0401,220,O-OK. Understood. I'll take care of the Mekkyaku.
SK0401,221,...
SK0401,222,What? You don't want it, Ogami?
SK0401,223,General Yoneda, is there any reason why you're entrusting this priceless item to me?
SK0401,224,I'm just doing this on a whim. I'll feel more at ease compared to leaving it here.
SK0401,225,O-OK... Understood. I will take care of it.
SK0401,226,Uh-huh. OK, Ogami. You can go home now.
SK0401,227,Yes! Well, I hope you take good care of yourself, Manager.
SK0401,228,Yeah! Take care of the gang at the theater while I'm here!
SK0401,229,Roger! Please excuse me.
SK0401,230,We've been waiting for ya, Chief! What was your business with the manager?
SK0401,231,Huh? You're bringing a sword. Is there something?
SK0401,232,Well, it's just... get it? Ah, anyways, thanks for waiting.
SK0401,233,Arf!
SK0401,234,Oh, it's you!
SK0401,235,Whoa... That's a really cute dog! Is it yours, Chief?
SK0401,236,Well... It looks like he's a stray dog.
SK0401,237,He was just about to get hit by a car earlier, so I saved him.
SK0401,238,Looks like he's been wanting to see you since then.
SK0401,239,Arf!
SK0401,240,Aw, looks like he doesn't want to be apart from you.
SK0401,241,I know, Ogami, how about we keep this puppy at the theater?
SK0401,242,Good idea, let's keep him!
SK0401,243,No way.
SK0401,244,I prefer cats.
SK0401,245,Good idea! You must have been lonely out here. Why don't you come home with us to the theater?
SK0401,246,Arf, arf! Woof!
SK0401,247,Ooh, that's a good boy.
SK0401,248,Thank you so much, Ogami!
SK0401,249,You're very nice, Chief.
SK0401,250,'Kay everyone, we're going home! To the theater we go!
SK0401,251,Arf, arf!
SK0401,252,No way. Keeping a pet is a lot more responsibility than you think.
SK0401,253,Come on, Ogami, everyone will take care of him. Pleeeease?
SK0401,254,Right, we'll all pitch in to take care of him! Please, Chief?
SK0401,255,Uhm... Well... OK, if you insist.
SK0401,256,Hurraaaay! It's a deal, then!
SK0401,257,Isn't that great, boy? Let's go home together!
SK0401,258,Arf, arf!
SK0401,259,I'm more of a cat person.
SK0401,260,Don't say that... Can we keep him, Ogami? Pleeease?
SK0401,261,Just like she said, Chief. We can't leave this poor puppy just like that.
SK0401,262,I'll make sure to take care of him along with Sakura. So can we keep him, please?
SK0401,263,Well... OK. If you insist.
SK0401,264,Hurraaaay! It's a deal, then!
SK0401,265,Isn't that great, boy? Let's go home together!
SK0401,266,Arf, arf!
SK0401,267,...
SK0401,268,We'll make sure to look after him, Ogami. Pleeease?
SK0401,269,Right, we'll take care of him. Don't worry, you can leave it all to us!
SK0401,270,Uhm... Well... OK, if you insist.
SK0401,271,Hurraaaay! It's a deal, then!
SK0401,272,Isn't that great, boy? Let's go home together!
SK0401,273,Arf, arf!
SK0401,274,Tell me some gossip.
SK0401,275,I'll come back later.
SK0401,276,Seems like you started keeping a dog in the courtyard, Ogami.
SK0401,277,You're right. Sorry I didn't ask your thoughts about it before.
SK0401,278,Oh, it's no problem! So, that dog's name is...
SK0401,279,It's <name>, isn't it?
SK0401,280,You're pretty quick at getting info, Yuri. Just like always.
SK0401,281,Ohoho. Actually, Kohran just dropped by to tell us the news. She was really excited to talk about it.
SK0401,282,That's great to hear.
SK0401,283,I hope you girls can come play with him sometime.
SK0401,284,Has Mr. Yoneda been doing OK?
SK0401,285,Yeah, we just visited him in the hospital and he was as lively as ever.
SK0401,286,He's not allowed to drink there, so it must be a good opportunity for his body to recover.
SK0401,287,Well, this is the manager we're talking about. He's probably been sneaking alcohol in.
SK0401,288,I heard from Kanna recently that some food in the kitchen's gone missing.
SK0401,289,Huh?! D-Don't tell me there are rats?
SK0401,290,I don't think so. The food disappears along with the packaging.
SK0401,291,Do you think there's someone living here who we don't even know about?
SK0401,292,Just kidding. Although wouldn't that idea scare you?
SK0401,293,Ogami, have you ever been to Café Paulista?
SK0401,294,Um, Cafe... what now? No, I haven't.
SK0401,295,They have delicious coffee and donuts!
SK0401,296,It's a wonderful cafe, many authors and playwrights visit there frequently.
SK0401,297,Whenever I go there, it's a bit hard to eavesdrop on all the conversations. It gets tiring sometimes.
SK0401,298,By the way, I heard that there are some female bus drivers these days!
SK0401,299,It's great to see women working alongside men. 
SK0401,300,I must admire them a bit.
SK0401,301,Since we're talking about it, you're a man working among a bunch of women right?
SK0401,302,By the way, Maria is scheduled to return from America soon.
SK0401,303,Huh, is that so? That's a relief.
SK0401,304,You look happy to hear that, Ogami. Were you lonely without Maria?
SK0401,305,I-It's not like that. I'm just happy that another one of the Flower Division will be returning soon.
SK0401,306,It's hard keeping an eye on all the other members by myself.
SK0401,307,I see. It does seem really hard to keep everyone together by yourself.
SK0401,308,That reminds me, recently, people claim that they've seen a person with a guitar around the theater.
SK0401,309,Sometimes there's guitar is playing alongside the person singing.
SK0401,310,Apparently they're not from the theater's orchestra.
SK0401,311,If we find out who that is, I'll be sure to let you know right away.
SK0401,312,O-OK... Thanks.
SK0401,313,Speaking of which, summer break is coming up next month.
SK0401,314,I'm thinking of buying a brand new swimsuit to go to the beach! How about we go together, Kasumi?
SK0401,315,Um... I think I'll pass... Anyway, do you have any plans for summer break, Ogami?
SK0401,316,Uh... My job doesn't get days off, let alone summer break.
SK0401,317,Sorry, Ogami, but I'm all out of gossip for now.
SK0401,318,I'll have some more interesting tidbits for you another time, so look forward to it!
SK0401,319,Oh, Ogami, I see you bought Maria's photo.
SK0401,320,Since she's in America, I figured I should at least have something like that.
SK0401,321,How about I give you Maria's call number, Ogami?
SK0401,322,Are you sure?
SK0401,323,It's fine. She gave me her number in case of emergencies.
SK0401,324,You can talk to her if you dial "13900."
SK0401,325,13900. OK, Yuri. Thanks!
SK0401,326,I'll come back another time. Good luck with your work.
SK0401,327,OK. Thanks for coming, Ogami.
SK0401,328,Tell us if you hear any juicy stories!
SK0401,329,Sorry, Ogami, but each customer is only allowed to purchase one photo at a time.
SK0401,330,I see. That's too bad...
SK0401,331,My apologies, Ogami, but each customer is only allowed to purchase one photo at a time.
SK0401,332,Oh, really? That's too bad...

SK0402,1,Ahh, so that's what happened, eh?
SK0402,2,Guess that means that starting today, we've got our own little doggy!
SK0402,3,Yaaaay! We've got a new friend!
SK0402,4,Arf, arf!
SK0402,5,We should come up with a name for this little pup.
SK0402,6,Yeah. Looks like he's a boy, so I wonder what sort of name would be best...
SK0402,7,We oughta name him somethin' manly, so he'll grow up nice an' strong.
SK0402,8,What?! No, let's pick a cute name!
SK0402,9,Ogami, how about you ask everyone for their opinions and then decide for us?
SK0402,10,We're counting on you.
SK0402,11,Why don't we call him "Shiro"?
SK0402,12,It means white, and he has such beautiful white fur, after all. I think it fits perfectly.
SK0402,13,I think "Shiro" is a great name.
SK0402,14,All right, let's go with Shiro.
SK0402,15,Let me think on it a bit longer.
SK0402,16,I see you've changed into a summer outfit.
SK0402,17,All right, let's go with Shiro.
SK0402,18,Let me think on it a bit longer.
SK0402,19,All right, let's go with Shiro. White is the first thing you see when you look at him, so it really does fit perfectly.
SK0402,20,Is that so? I'm glad to hear that.
SK0402,21,All right, it's decided, then! Welcome to the team, Shiro!
SK0402,22,Arf, arf! Woof!
SK0402,23,Let me think on it a bit longer. Since we're giving him a name, I want to be sure it's the right one.
SK0402,24,Sure. Go find out what the others think and decide on a nice name for him.
SK0402,25,I see you've changed into your summer outfit too, Sakura.
SK0402,26,Yes. I'm really pleased to hear that you like it, Ogami.
SK0402,27,Ooh, what's up? Did something happen with you and the Chief?
SK0402,28,Heheh, that's a seeeecret. Right, Ogami?
SK0402,29,Uh, y-yeah.
SK0402,30,That summer dress looks great on you.
SK0402,31,I thought you said you preferred my usual outfit.
SK0402,32,Uh... I mean...
SK0402,33,Haha, I'm just kidding. Thanks for saying so.
SK0402,34,What do you think, Ogami? Does it suit me?
SK0402,35,Yeah, you look fantastic wearing that, Sakura.
SK0402,36,Th-Thank you. I'm happy to hear... that you think it looks good.
SK0402,37,You didn't say anything earlier, so I felt kind of nervous.
SK0402,38,How nice, Sakura. He said it looks good on you.
SK0402,39,Looking at this dog, a name springs to mind right away.
SK0402,40,Oh, what name?
SK0402,41,Hanamaru." It has an elegant lilt to it, yes?
SK0402,42,Since it carries the meaning of flowers, don't you think it's a fitting name for a new member of the Flower Division?
SK0402,43,Indeed, any other name is simply unthinkable. Don't you agree, Ensign?
SK0402,44,All right, let's go with Hanamaru.
SK0402,45,Let me think on it a bit longer.
SK0402,46,Your summer outfit looks nice.
SK0402,47,All right, let's go with Hanamaru.
SK0402,48,Let me think on it a bit longer.
SK0402,49,All right, let's go with Hanamaru. You're right Sumire, it's a really fitting name.
SK0402,50,Ohohoho! I knew that I could count upon you to have good sense in names, Ensign!
SK0402,51,OK, then it's decided. This pup's name will be Hanamaru.
SK0402,52,Let's get along, Hanamaru!
SK0402,53,Arf, arf! Woof!
SK0402,54,Let me think on it a bit longer. Since we're giving him a name, I want to be sure it's the right one.
SK0402,55,Consider it as long as you must. I'm certain you will realize that my name is the best choice.
SK0402,56,I don't know too much about clothing, but I think your summer outfit looks nice.
SK0402,57,Ensign! Have you not said the exact same thing to each one of us?!
SK0402,58,Uh... S-Sorry.
SK0402,59,Heavens, what a tremendously rude way to treat a lady!
SK0402,60,Ensign... My deepest thanks.
SK0402,61,You certainly do have good taste. How delightful.
SK0402,62,Well, I think "Dai" would be a good name for 'im.
SK0402,63,He's just a lil' guy right now, but if we name him "Dai" like the word for "big", he'll grow up big and strong.
SK0402,64,I think my name suits him best.
SK0402,65,All right, let's go with Dai.
SK0402,66,Let me think on it a bit longer.
SK0402,67,Your summer clothes look really cool.
SK0402,68,All right, let's go with Dai.
SK0402,69,Let me think on it a bit longer.
SK0402,70,Dai is a great name, if you ask me. I'm sure he'll grow into a big, healthy dog.
SK0402,71,Heheh, you think so too, Boss? This lil' guy's got a lot of potential, I'm sure of it.
SK0402,72,Looks like you've got a name, Dai. And it's a good one, too!
SK0402,73,Arf, arf, arf!!
SK0402,74,Let me think on it a bit longer. Since we're giving him a name, I want to be sure it's the right one.
SK0402,75,Take your time and don't rush it. He's gonna carry whatever name we give 'im his whole life, after all.
SK0402,76,By the way, Kanna... That's not your usual karate gi, is it? It looks good on you, though.
SK0402,77,C-C'mon, Boss, what're you talkin' about? Let's come up with a name for this lil' guy first!
SK0402,78,Heavens, Kanna, your face has turned the brightest shade of red. Whatever could be the matter?
SK0402,79,Gimme a break, Sumire! The Boss is over here sayin' all this weird stuff, that's all.
SK0402,80,I thought of a name too, Mon Frère.
SK0402,81,How about "Torte"? Wouldn't it be so cute to name him after something sweet?
SK0402,82,Come on, let's call him "Torte." Look, he's even wagging his tail! So I'm sure he likes it, too.
SK0402,83,All right, let's go with Torte.
SK0402,84,Let me think on it a bit longer.
SK0402,85,Your summer outfit looks wonderful on you.
SK0402,86,All right, let's go with Torte.
SK0402,87,Let me think on it a bit longer.
SK0402,88,All right, let's go with Torte, then.
SK0402,89,Really? Hoorayyy!!
SK0402,90,It's nice to meet you, Torte. This is my bear, Jean-Paul. I hope you'll be friends with him.
SK0402,91,What a cute name you've been given, Torte!
SK0402,92,Arf, arf! Woof!
SK0402,93,I see... I'm going to give some thought to the other names, too.
SK0402,94,Aww, you don't wanna use "Torte"? But I think it's a good name...
SK0402,95,I see you've changed into your summer clothes as well, Iris.
SK0402,96,Hee hee, I knew you'd notice, Mon Frère! So you think it looks good on me, right? Right?
SK0402,97,Yeah, it does. It's such a cute outfit, it suits you perfectly.
SK0402,98,Eheheh... Thanks, Mon Frère.
SK0402,99,I had a hunch things might end up like this, so I thought up a name on the way back from the hospital.
SK0402,100,And that name is "Long"! It's the Chinese word for "dragon."
SK0402,101,Right now he's just a little squirt, but we want him to grow big enough to stretch toward the heavens, like a dragon...
SK0402,102,That's the feel I was going for, anyway. Sounds awesome, right?!
SK0402,103,So, whaddaya think of "Long"? I think it's pretty great, myself.
SK0402,104,All right, let's go with Long.
SK0402,105,Let me think on it a bit longer.
SK0402,106,That must be your summer outfit.
SK0402,107,All right, let's go with Long.
SK0402,108,Let me think on it a bit longer.
SK0402,109,All right, let's go with Long. A dragon big enough to reach the heavens... Yeah, it's a great name.
SK0402,110,That's what I'm talking about! You always seem to get me, Chief.
SK0402,111,Come here, Long!
SK0402,112,Arf, arf, arf!!
SK0402,113,Yaaay! He knows when we say his name!
SK0402,114,Arf, arf!!
SK0402,115,Let me think on it a bit longer. I might decide to go with a different name.
SK0402,116,Sure thing. Think it over real good.
SK0402,117,That must be your summer outfit. It looks really good on you.
SK0402,118,Huh? If you're talking about this old thing, it's what I always wear. Did you hit your head or something?
SK0402,119,Well, it's just that when I take a closer look at it, I feel like it really does suit you perfectly.
SK0402,120,Aww, Chief... Butter me up all you want, it won't get you anywhere.
SK0402,121,Let me see... What do you think of "Altair"?
SK0402,122,It is one of the stars of Tanabata. In Japan you call it "Hikoboshi."
SK0402,123,Now is the season for Tanabata, so I'm thinking this name is very timely.
SK0402,124,Altair"... It's such a romantic, mysterious name.
SK0402,125,All right, let's go with Altair.
SK0402,126,Let me think on it a bit longer.
SK0402,127,Your summer outfit looks nice.
SK0402,128,All right, let's go with Altair.
SK0402,129,Let me think on it a bit longer.
SK0402,130,All right, let's go with Altair! From the star "Hikoboshi"... Orihime is the other star, so it matches your name, then.
SK0402,131,That's true. And Altair is such a mighty-sounding name, too.
SK0402,132,How about that, Altair? Since I have given you the name of my partner...
SK0402,133,You must grow up into a splendid dog. Do you understand?
SK0402,134,Arf, arf, arf!!
SK0402,135,I wonder if any of the other names would be better... I'm going to think on it a bit longer.
SK0402,136,Mamma mia, Japanese men are so indecisive.
SK0402,137,I thought something seemed different, but it looks as though you've just changed into a summer dress.
SK0402,138,Wh-Why do you say this, all of the sudden?!
SK0402,139,I don't know much of anything about clothes, but I like it a lot.
SK0402,140,I-Is that right...?
SK0402,141,Your face is sooo red, Orihime! If you're happy, you should just say so!
SK0402,142,How very rare to see her looking so flustered.
SK0402,143,I-I am not flustered even in the least!
SK0402,144,Mamma mia, it was only because the Ensign said such a strange thing. Just forget it!
SK0402,145,Hmph. This is why I hate Japanese men. They are all so insincere.
SK0402,146,Insincere? That wasn't my intention at all...
SK0402,147,You've gone around and told all of us how nice we look, have you not?
SK0402,148,How am I to believe anyone so loose with his words?
SK0402,149,I see... I'm sorry. I guess it was pretty thoughtless of me.
SK0402,150,Reni, have you thought of any good names for him?
SK0402,151,...
SK0402,152,Anything is fine. Just tell me the first name that comes to mind.
SK0402,153,...Hund.
SK0402,154,Hund?
SK0402,155,The German word for "dog."
SK0402,156,Hmm...
SK0402,157,...But if you don't want to use it, that's fine, too.
SK0402,158,All right, let's go with Hund.
SK0402,159,Let me think on it a bit longer.
SK0402,160,Your summer outfit looks nice.
SK0402,161,All right, let's go with Hund.
SK0402,162,Let me think on it a bit longer.
SK0402,163,All right, let's go with Hund since you took the time to come up with it.
SK0402,164,...
SK0402,165,Still, naming a dog "Dog" doesn't sound quite right, does it?
SK0402,166,Whaddya mean? Kohran here gives her weird machines all kinds of weird names.
SK0402,167,And those are at least a hundred times more weird than this, right?
SK0402,168,What's the big idea, dragging me into this?!
SK0402,169,Heheh, how nice for you, Hund. I hope we become good friends.
SK0402,170,Arf, arf! Woof!
SK0402,171,Hmm, it's not quite fitting... Maybe I'll go with something else.
SK0402,172,...
SK0402,173,Oh, that looks like a nice, cool outfit. It suits you pretty well.
SK0402,174,...
SK0402,175,How nice, Reni! Mon Frère thinks you look cute.
SK0402,176,I see... Then I am pleased.
SK0402,177,Ever the stoic, aren't you, Reni?
SK0402,178,Based on the typical temperature and humidity of Japan, this clothing provides the most maneuverability.
SK0402,179,O-OK...
SK0402,180,Ogami, please pick a good name for this pup.
SK0402,181,Hey, Chief, are you gonna run off without giving this poor doggy a name?
SK0402,182,Mon Frère, what should we name the puppy?!
SK0402,183,Ogami, please pick a good name for this pup.
SK0402,184,Oh, it looks like [dog]
SK0402,185,likes his name, too.
SK0402,186,Since we've decided on a name for the dog, why don't we disperse for the time being?
SK0402,187,In that case, I will be found in the music room, playing on the piano.
SK0402,188,I think I might take a bath and then do some sword training in the courtyard.
SK0402,189,Guess we're gonna get going, then. Later, Boss.
SK0402,190,Well then... I've got some time until dinner. I guess I'll wander around the theater.
SK0402,191,Hey, Chief, do you have a second?
SK0402,192,What is it, Kohran? You sound serious.
SK0402,193,There's something I wanna bend your ear about. Mind coming to my room at 4 o'clock?
SK0402,194,Sure, I'll be there.
SK0402,195,Sorry... I'm a bit busy right now.
SK0402,196,Why not right now?
SK0402,197,Sure, I'll be there. Your room, 4 o'clock. Got it.
SK0402,198,Thank you kindly! I knew you'd come through for me.
SK0402,199,Then I'll be waiting for you in my room at 4. Later gator!
SK0402,200,Sorry... I'm a bit busy right now.
SK0402,201,Y'know, I never said it had to be right now.
SK0402,202,C'mon Chief, don't give me the cold shoulder like that. I just need you an hour from now. 
SK0402,203,Hmm... I see. In that case, I'll come to your room at 4.
SK0402,204,Alrighty. Then I'll be waiting for you, Chief!
SK0402,205,You want to talk? Why not right now?
SK0402,206,That's a no-go. I'll be busy for at least the next hour, that's why I asked.
SK0402,207,I see. In that case, I'll head to your room at 4.
SK0402,208,Sorry, I hope asking that doesn't make me sound too big-headed. Anyway, I'll be waiting in my room at 4!
SK0402,209,...
SK0402,210,Still with me, Chief?
SK0402,211,Oh, uh, sorry. Um... What were you saying?
SK0402,212,...Listen.
SK0402,213,I wanna talk to you about something, so I need you to meet me at my room at 4 o'clock.
SK0402,214,R-Right, I got it. 4 o'clock, I'll be there.
SK0402,215,I'll be waiting in my room then. Later gator, Chief!
SK0402,216,I wonder what it is that she needs me to come to her room for?
SK0402,217,If I'm meeting her at 4, then I've got an hour to kill. Guess I'll find something to do until then.
SK0402,218,Oh, it's Reni.
SK0402,219,Hey, Reni. Nice weather, huh?
SK0402,220,...
SK0402,221,So, uh... Are you getting some sunbathing in?
SK0402,222,...
SK0402,223,(Shoot. I don't know how to keep the conversation going.)
SK0402,224,Arf, arf!
SK0402,225,Hey,
SK0402,226,[dog]!
SK0402,227,Arf, arf!
SK0402,228,Seems like [dog] wants to play with you, Reni.
SK0402,229,Arf!
SK0402,230,...
SK0402,231,Reni...
SK0402,232,Go play with Shiro.
SK0402,233,Go play with Hanamaru.
SK0402,234,Go play with Dai.
SK0402,235,Go play with Torte.
SK0402,236,Go play with Long.
SK0402,237,Go play with Altair.
SK0402,238,Go play with Hund.
SK0402,239,Do you dislike dogs?
SK0402,240,Reni, why not play with [dog]
SK0402,241,since he's here?
SK0402,242,It looks like he wants to play with you, too.
SK0402,243,Arf, arf!
SK0402,244,...I would prefer to avoid any excessive movement.
SK0402,245,Do you dislike dogs, Reni?
SK0402,246,Not particularly...
SK0402,247,Arf, arf!
SK0402,248,...
SK0402,249,Arf, arf!
SK0402,250,Reni,
SK0402,251,just look how much [dog] wants to play with you.
SK0402,252,You could at least give him a pat on the head.
SK0402,253,...
SK0402,254,Well, there is somewhere I must be...
SK0402,255,Ah, Reni!
SK0402,256,Shoot, too late.
SK0402,257,Whiiine...
SK0402,258,There there,
SK0402,259,[dog]. I'm sure Reni will come around eventually.
SK0402,260,Oh my, Ensign...
SK0402,261,Arf, arf!
SK0402,262,Hi, Sumire.
SK0402,263,Were you playing with [dog]?
SK0402,264,Yes. My family kept a dog once, when I was younger.
SK0402,265,Although he was quite a bit larger than this fellow, he made an excellent playmate.
SK0402,266,Well then,
SK0402,267,[dog]. Let us play again another time.
SK0402,268,Arf, arf!
SK0402,269,I wish Reni would play with you, too.
SK0402,270,I should get going, too. See you later,
SK0402,271,[dog].
SK0402,272,Woof!
SK0402,273,Arf!
SK0402,274,Hey there,
SK0402,275,[dog]. How do you like the theater so far?
SK0402,276,Arf, arf!
SK0402,277,Hahaha. I wonder what you're saying? It's almost like you can understand me.
SK0402,278,Anyway, I should be off. See you later,
SK0402,279,[dog].
SK0402,280,Woof!
SK0402,281,Hey, Sakura.
SK0402,282,Ah, Ogami.
SK0402,283,Hm? What happened to the summer dress you had on earlier?
SK0402,284,I'm just about to start my sword training, so I got changed.
SK0402,285,It turns out my usual traditional clothing is better at getting me in the right frame of mind for training.
SK0402,286,Hahaha... Yeah, I see what you mean.
SK0402,287,I know! Would you like to train with me, Ogami?
SK0402,288,Sure, let's do it!
SK0402,289,No thanks, sounds like a pain.
SK0402,290,Sure, let's do it! I ought to get some exercise in occasionally.
SK0402,291,Really? I'd appreciate it.
SK0402,292,OK, I'll teach you what to do as we go. Now, let's get started!
SK0402,293,I think I got some good training in thanks to you. Thank you so much, Ogami.
SK0402,294,I'm glad I could help out.
SK0402,295,I'm going to keep it up for a while longer.
SK0402,296,I see. In that case, I'll be on my way.
SK0402,297,You did great!
SK0402,298,Thank you so much for training with me today, Ogami.
SK0402,299,Sure. I'm glad I could help you out.
SK0402,300,I'm going to keep it up for a while longer.
SK0402,301,I see. In that case, I'll be on my way.
SK0402,302,You did great!
SK0402,303,S-Sorry... I guess I wasn't much help after all.
SK0402,304,No, it's fine. It's enough that you wanted to help me train in the first place.
SK0402,305,If you have the time, I'd be happy to train with you again another day.
SK0402,306,When that time comes, I promise I'll try a little harder.
SK0402,307,Sure!
SK0402,308,Well, I'm going to keep it up for a while longer.
SK0402,309,I see. In that case, I'll be on my way.
SK0402,310,You did great!
SK0402,311,No thanks, sounds like a pain.
SK0402,312,Is that so... Well, I'm going to keep it up for a while longer.
SK0402,313,I see. In that case, I'll be on my way.
SK0402,314,All right, we'll do this together, Ogami.
SK0402,315,I'll teach you what to do as we go. Now, let's get started!
SK0402,316,Looks like Sakura is still training with her sword.
SK0402,317,I don't want to get in her way, so I'll go somewhere else.
SK0402,318,Huh. Is that Sumire?
SK0402,319,Ah, Ensign.
SK0402,320,Hey, Sumire. What are you up to?
SK0402,321,Why, I was only recalling our performance of the summer production the other day.
SK0402,322,It has been far too long since I stood in the spotlight onstage...
SK0402,323,The thunder of applause from the audience ringing in my ears... There is no feeling quite like it.
SK0402,324,I feel as though I was born to be an actress...
SK0402,325,Being onstage is where I find my bliss...
SK0402,326,You're absolutely right.
SK0402,327,You were perfect for the role.
SK0402,328,Keep up the hard work.
SK0402,329,You're absolutely right. The way you returned to us and jumped right back onstage...
SK0402,330,And that scene you shared with Kanna... It was fantastic to see. I'd expect no less from you, Sumire.
SK0402,331,Hohoho... You understand me so well, Ensign.
SK0402,332,It's simply my talent at work. This is what a true star looks like!
SK0402,333,You really were perfect for the role of Goneril, if you ask me.
SK0402,334,The scene where you give Kanna's King Lear a hard time felt so true to life!
SK0402,335,Excuse me? Are you saying that was anything less than my acting on display?
SK0402,336,Gah... N-No, that's not what I...
SK0402,337,Besides, the part was the only thing I was unsatisfied with.
SK0402,338,Why was I not given the lead role? It's beyond my understanding!
SK0402,339,What a terrible shame for those fans who loyally awaited my return.
SK0402,340,R-Right...
SK0402,341,Keep up the hard work. I'll be in the crowd, cheering you on.
SK0402,342,My, Ensign. Such kind words, but they are unneeded.
SK0402,343,Talent like mine hardly requires such things as "hard work" or "effort."
SK0402,344,R-Right...
SK0402,345,In the first place, it's careless to believe our hard work only happens in front of the audience.
SK0402,346,I believe that hard work is something which happens behind the scenes, each and every day.
SK0402,347,I see...
SK0402,348,...You've gone rather quiet all of a sudden. Is there something the matter?
SK0402,349,Uh... I was just, um... Thinking of how to respond.
SK0402,350,You know, Ensign, it is important to keep pace in conversations.
SK0402,351,If you cannot hold a dialogue where you respond in a timely manner, you're not fit to converse with a lady.
SK0402,352,R-Right. Sorry.
SK0402,353,In any case, I'm really relieved to have you back with us again, Sumire.
SK0402,354,Goodness, I did tell you during our last correspondence that I would return shortly, didn't I?
SK0402,355,Besides, there is never truly a dull moment here at the theater.
SK0402,356,Sumire...
SK0402,357,I should be on my way, as it is time for me to take my tea.
SK0402,358,Have a lovely day, Ensign.
SK0402,359,She may have brushed it off, but I'm sure she must be happy to be back, too.
SK0402,360,Well... I ought to get going, myself.
SK0402,361,There's no one onstage. It doesn't look like rehearsal has begun yet.
SK0402,362,Oh well. Guess I'll go someplace else.
SK0402,363,Oh, Ogami. Do you need something?
SK0402,364,You came here to listen to my gossip, right, Ogami?
SK0402,365,It's nice to see you again, Ogami.
SK0402,366,I'm all out of rumors at the moment. Sorry!
SK0402,367,I see, that's too bad.
SK0402,368,I'll have some more interesting tidbits for you another time, so look forward to it!
SK0402,369,Hey, Yuri and Kasumi.
SK0402,370,Oh, hello, Ogami. Is there something you need?
SK0402,371,I've got plenty of new, juicy gossip for you. Ask away!
SK0402,372,Hello there, Ogami! Would you like to buy something?
SK0402,373,Buy a photo.
SK0402,374,Talk to Tsubaki.
SK0402,375,Leave.
SK0402,376,Could I buy a photo?
SK0402,377,Sorry, Ogami. I can only sell one photo at a time.
SK0402,378,Please understand, we need to keep some for the customers.
SK0402,379,You'd like to buy a photo? Thank you very much!
SK0402,380,That's a photo of Sakura.
SK0402,381,Let's see... Sakura's photo, right?
SK0402,382,That'll be 50 sen. Thank you very much!
SK0402,383,That's a photo of Sumire.
SK0402,384,Let's see... Sumire's photo, right?
SK0402,385,That'll be 50 sen. Thank you very much!
SK0402,386,That's a photo of Maria.
SK0402,387,Let's see... Maria's photo, right?
SK0402,388,That'll be 50 sen. Thank you very much!
SK0402,389,That's a photo of Kanna.
SK0402,390,Let's see... Kanna's photo, right?
SK0402,391,That'll be 50 sen. Thank you very much!
SK0402,392,That's a photo of Iris.
SK0402,393,Let's see... Iris's photo, right?
SK0402,394,That'll be 50 sen. Thank you very much!
SK0402,395,That's a photo of Kohran.
SK0402,396,Let's see... Kohran's photo, right?
SK0402,397,That'll be 50 sen. Thank you very much!
SK0402,398,That's Orihime's photo, isn't it?
SK0402,399,Well... It's Orihime's photo, isn't it?
SK0402,400,That'll be 50 sen. Thank you very much!
SK0402,401,It's Reni's photo.
SK0402,402,OK, Reni's photo, is it?
SK0402,403,That'll be 50 sen. Thank you very much!
SK0402,404,Oh, you're not going to buy it?
SK0402,405,Oh yeah, you brought back that super cute little doggy earlier, didn't you?
SK0402,406,I guess he lives here at the theater with us now, huh?
SK0402,407,Oh, right! His name was [dog],
SK0402,408,if I remember.
SK0402,409,Cute little [dog]! What a great name!
SK0402,410,Would it be OK if I played with him after I'm done working?
SK0402,411,Yeah, of course. I bet he'll really take a liking to you, Tsubaki.
SK0402,412,Ooh, I can't wait to play with [dog]!
SK0402,413,Well, I should be going. Keep up the good work.
SK0402,414,Thanks very much! Come back again soon!
SK0402,415,Thank you very much! Come back and buy another photo next month!
SK0402,416,Hmm, it looks like the door to the manager's office was left open.
SK0402,417,Is someone inside?
SK0402,418,Oh, Saki, it's you. What're you doing in here?
SK0402,419,Ogami...
SK0402,420,I thought I would organize some of these documents while Mr. Yoneda is gone.
SK0402,421,But never mind that. You know, we're completely alone in here right now...
SK0402,422,So... kiss me.
SK0402,423,Eep!! Wh-What?!
SK0402,424,Please, hurry.
SK0402,425,Kiss her.
SK0402,426,Run away.
SK0402,427,Kiss her.
SK0402,428,Run away.
SK0402,429,Scold her.
SK0402,430,O-OK then, if you want me to, then...
SK0402,431,Ogami...
SK0402,432,...
SK0402,433,(...Huh? I don't feel anything.)
SK0402,434,...Saki?
SK0402,435,Hmmhmm, you were being serious, then? Oh, Ogami, you're so adorable.
SK0402,436,Huh? Saki, where'd you go?
SK0402,437,Umm... I think she just pulled a fast one on me.
SK0402,438,Tch, forget it. No point in sticking around here, so I'm gonna leave.
SK0402,439,S-Sorry! I've... got to go!
SK0402,440,Ogami!
SK0402,441,Phew. I wonder if I ran far enough?
SK0402,442,Still, why in the world would she suddenly up and ask me something like that?
SK0402,443,Saki, do you have any idea what you're asking me?!
SK0402,444,Begging me to kiss you in the manager's office while he's in the hospital... It's completely shameless!
SK0402,445,Oh dear, you're even cute when you're angry.
SK0402,446,Don't take things so seriously! Isn't that what Yoneda himself always says? So come now, hurry...
SK0402,447,I can't deal with this any longer. Excuse me!
SK0402,448,Good grief. I wonder if I got far enough away.
SK0402,449,But anyway, why in the world would she suddenly up and ask me something like that?
SK0402,450,Hmmhmm, scared, aren't you? Then I'll start us off...
SK0402,451,(It... It would be really bad if anyone saw this!)
SK0402,452,S-Sorry! I've... got to go!
SK0402,453,Ogami!
SK0402,454,Phew. I wonder if I ran far enough?
SK0402,455,Still, why in the world would she suddenly up and ask me something like that?
SK0402,456,Saki is gone. I'm not sure whether to be relieved or disappointed...
SK0402,457,OK, enough of these stupid thoughts, Ogami. Time to go somewhere else.
SK0402,458,Hi, Orihime.
SK0402,459,...
SK0402,460,I have not a thing to say to you, Ensign! Please excuse me!
SK0402,461,Oh man... She certainly was angry with me.
SK0402,462,Oh well. Guess I'll head elsewhere.
SK0402,463,Oh Ensign, it's you.
SK0402,464,What're you doing in here?
SK0402,465,I am relaxing and stretching out my legs for a moment.
SK0402,466,This "tatami" had me surprised at first, but I have come to like it very much.
SK0402,467,You've gotten accustomed to it, then?
SK0402,468,And you were so skeptical of it before...
SK0402,469,I guess you've steadily gotten accustomed to life here, then?
SK0402,470,I'm a bit relieved to see that. There's nothing better than being at ease where you live.
SK0402,471,This theater IS a little cramped, but also rather cozy at the same time.
SK0402,472,And you were so skeptical of it being made of grass before...
SK0402,473,I think anyone would be surprised to hear that the floor is made of grass!
SK0402,474,Hahaha, I was just teasing you.
SK0402,475,When I heard it was grass, my first thought was whether there were bugs inside of it...
SK0402,476,I didn't imagine it would feel this nice on your feet.
SK0402,477,In any case, I'm happy to hear you like the tatami.
SK0402,478,Yes, though that is not the case with Japanese men.
SK0402,479,I will be going now, if you please.
SK0402,480,Oh, come on... I guess nothing's changed on that front.
SK0402,481,This has basically become the "party room" as of late...
SK0402,482,But thankfully, it's back to being used for its original purpose because of the King Lear performances.
SK0402,483,Hi, Orihime.
SK0402,484,Oh, Ensign. As always, you seem to have very much free time on your hands.
SK0402,485,I-I guess. Anyway, are you practicing the piano?
SK0402,486,It is not practice. I am training my creativity.
SK0402,487,Discerning one sound from another, technical skill, concentration, and creativity...
SK0402,488,All of these I believe are skills that carry over from music to the battlefield.
SK0402,489,So that's it. That line of thinking feels very like you, Orihime.
SK0402,490,Say, now! Why don't we have a test of your skills by playing for just a bit?
SK0402,491,How do you think, Ensign? Shall we try?
SK0402,492,Sure, let's do it.
SK0402,493,Haha...There's no way I can do that.
SK0402,494,Sure, let's do it.
SK0402,495,Well, do try your hardest not to embarrass yourself!
SK0402,496,Haha...There's no way I can do that. I don't have any ear for music at all.
SK0402,497,Yes, I've no doubt your abilities here amount to much at all.
SK0402,498,But will the Flower Division's captain really be so quick to turn tail and run from a challenge?
SK0402,499,Uh...
SK0402,500,I suppose you can go and waste as much time as you'd like.
SK0402,501,Unlike you, I have places where I must be. So I will excuse myself now.
SK0402,502,With Orihime gone, I guess I've got the room to myself.
SK0402,503,What do you say, then? Will you do it or not?
SK0402,504,...All right. I'll give it a shot.
SK0402,505,Ooh...don't blame me if this turns out to be too much for you.
SK0402,506,Well, do try your hardest not to embarrass yourself!
SK0402,507,My, my... A surprisingly good showing, Ensign.
SK0402,508,Hahaha... I wouldn't go that far.
SK0402,509,I think this is what they call "beginner's luck" or "happy accident", isn't it?
SK0402,510,I suppose it was a perfect way to kill some time.
SK0402,511,Unlike you, I have places where I must be. So I will excuse myself now.
SK0402,512,With Orihime gone, I guess I've got the room to myself.
SK0402,513,Hmm... I feel like I could have tried a little harder.
SK0402,514,I expected nothing less than mediocrity from you, Ensign.
SK0402,515,From that standpoint at least, it was quite impressive.
SK0402,516,Ugh...
SK0402,517,But still, I suppose it was a perfect way to kill some time.
SK0402,518,Unlike you, I have places where I must be. So I will excuse myself now.
SK0402,519,With Orihime gone, I guess I've got the room to myself.
SK0402,520,I did not expect much of you, but I never imagined you would do quite this badly...
SK0402,521,To be frank, it is a wonder to me that you've served as Flower Division captain this long.
SK0402,522,W-Was I really that bad?
SK0402,523,Coming this far with as little sense as you have is an accomplishment all its own.
SK0402,524,Well, at the very least, watching you was an amusing way to kill the time.
SK0402,525,I will be on my way now.
SK0402,526,Unlike you, I have places where I must be. So I will excuse myself now.
SK0402,527,With Orihime gone, I guess I've got the room to myself.
SK0402,528,Yep, Orihime's not here anymore.
SK0402,529,She said she was headed somewhere else, so maybe I should go, too.
SK0402,530,Nobody's here. Time to try another room.
SK0402,531,Heya, Boss.
SK0402,532,Hey, Kanna. Hmm... Something smells pretty good.
SK0402,533,Heheheh, I'm whipping up Chef Kanna's Ultra-Special Menu!
SK0402,534,It's bitter melon chanpuru, a dish we make where I'm from back on Okinawa.
SK0402,535,You just stir-fry some bitter melon with eggs.
SK0402,536,Sounds pretty tasty, right?!
SK0402,537,It sure does!
SK0402,538,Not to me...
SK0402,539,It sure does! I bet it's nice and refreshing in the summer heat, too.
SK0402,540,That's my Boss! I knew you'd get it!
SK0402,541,All right, here ya go, Boss-man. Eat up!
SK0402,542,I'm still in the middle of makin' it, but I should be finished up by around 3:30.
SK0402,543,Come back to the cafeteria in 30 minutes or so, and I'll feed you as much as you can eat!
SK0402,544,OK, thanks Kanna. I'll come back in a bit, then.
SK0402,545,Come back hungry, ya hear?
SK0402,546,I don't know... Bitter melon doesn't sound all that tasty to me.
SK0402,547,So that's how you respond when someone goes outta their way to tell you how good something tastes?
SK0402,548,Guess there's no accountin' for taste...
SK0402,549,S-Sorry.
SK0402,550,Why not try it out, just for the heck of it?
SK0402,551,I'm still in the middle of makin' it, but I should be finished up by around 3:30.
SK0402,552,Come back to the cafeteria in 30 minutes or so, and I'll feed you as much as you can eat!
SK0402,553,A-All right. I may swing back around if I feel so inclined.
SK0402,554,You may as well give it a taste! I'll be here!
SK0402,555,Hmm, I can't decide if that would taste good or not...
SK0402,556,Oh yeah...? All right, I'm gonna serve you some, Boss.
SK0402,557,I'm still in the middle of makin' it, but I should be finished up by around 3:30.
SK0402,558,Come back to the cafeteria in 30 minutes or so, and I'll feed you as much as you can eat!
SK0402,559,OK, thanks Kanna. I'll come back in a bit, then.
SK0402,560,Yeah, you better be ready for it! I promise it'll be great.
SK0402,561,Hey, Boss. I'm still makin' that chanpuru right now.
SK0402,562,I think it'll be done in about 30 minutes, so come back here then.
SK0402,563,Come back around 3:30, got it.
SK0402,564,Yep! I'm sure that'll give your stomach enough time to make some room.
SK0402,565,Man, it smells really good.
SK0402,566,...I can smell it as much as I want, but that won't make it cook any faster. I better go.
SK0402,567,Man, it smells really good.
SK0402,568,This must be the scent of Kanna's bitter melon chanpuru.
SK0402,569,...I can smell it as much as I want, but that won't make it cook any faster. I better go.
SK0402,570,Yo, Boss!
SK0402,571,Hey Kanna. I'm back and ready to eat, just like you told me.
SK0402,572,Heheh, thanks for waitin'. Take a seat.
SK0402,573,Hi Kanna. Are you eating right now?
SK0402,574,Yep. This is Chef Kanna's Ultra-Special Menu.
SK0402,575,It's bitter melon chanpuru, a dish we make where I'm from back on Okinawa.
SK0402,576,You just stir-fry some bitter melon with eggs. Sounds pretty tasty, right?!
SK0402,577,You can have some too, if you want. Go on, take a seat!
SK0402,578,Well, since you're offering... OK then.
SK0402,579,Here ya go, Boss. Help yourself.
SK0402,580,Sure thing. Thanks for the meal.
SK0402,581,...Wow, this is great! I could eat bowlfuls of this!
SK0402,582,Heheh, I knew you'd be into it! Man, I never get tired of watchin' you eat.
SK0402,583,Say, Boss. How's about you an' me have a little eating contest?
SK0402,584,The rules are simple: whichever of us can eat three servings of food the fastest is the winner!
SK0402,585,Sounds fun. I'll take that challenge!
SK0402,586,Bitter melon chanpuru
SK0402,587,Rice
SK0402,588,Tea
SK0402,589,All right, here we go! Ready...start!
SK0402,590,OK... What should I grab first?
SK0402,591,Mm, bitter melon stir-fried with eggs...so tasty.
SK0402,592,Pretty great, huh? This recipe is my specialty!
SK0402,593,*munch* *munch*... The seasoning is fantastic!
SK0402,594,And the rice is steamed to perfection, too. *munch* *munch*
SK0402,595,*munch* *gulp* Phew...need to catch my breath...Okay, onto the next one!
SK0402,596,Which one should I eat? Hmm, this is tough...
SK0402,597,What're you doing, Boss? Better get to eating unless you want me to come out on top.
SK0402,598,OK, I finished the first serving. What do you think, Kanna?
SK0402,599,Hey, not bad. But you've still got some food left. Start shovelin' it in!
SK0402,600,OK, onto meal two!
SK0402,601,Bitter melon chanpuru...
SK0402,602,Rice...
SK0402,603,Tea...
SK0402,604,Bitter melon chanpuru...it was good at first, but I'm starting to get tired of it.
SK0402,605,*munch* *gulp* Okay! Managed to get it down!
SK0402,606,The rice isn't as easy to wolf down as it was the first time, either...
SK0402,607,*chomp* Ugh...there, that should be all of it.
SK0402,608,Phew...I feel a little better after washing it down with some tea.
SK0402,609,But I've still got food left to eat. Sigh...this is wearing me down.
SK0402,610,Is it just me, or... I can't seem to move my chopsticks like before.
SK0402,611,What's wrong, Boss? Ready to give up?
SK0402,612,Man...I-I think two servings is my limit.
SK0402,613,Hey, not bad! I didn't even think you'd eat this much!
SK0402,614,Kanna...you're completely unruffled by this, huh?
SK0402,615,Damn...I've come this far, I can't give up now!
SK0402,616,B... Bitter...
SK0402,617,Ri... ce...
SK0402,618,Tea... Tea...
SK0402,619,Urgh... C'mon, Ogami... Just a little more...
SK0402,620,*munch*...
SK0402,621,*munch*...
SK0402,622,*chew*...
SK0402,623,Th-There! I finished off all the chanpuru!
SK0402,624,Just one more bite... Gotta eat all... the rice...
SK0402,625,Hey, wait, you OK? You're lookin' a bit green around the gills!
SK0402,626,Y-Yeah, just fine... Look, just one bite... left...
SK0402,627,Phewww! That's the last of the rice eaten!
SK0402,628,Ugh...my stomach's not doing too great right now...
SK0402,629,...Hraaah! Time to drain this in one gulp!
SK0402,630,Glub... Glub... Glub!
SK0402,631,Haah! And that's all the tea!
SK0402,632,Huff... Huff...
SK0402,633,Hey, Boss, you OK!? You can stop any time, man.
SK0402,634,Heheheh... I'm doing just fine... Just taking a quick break...
SK0402,635,There! I ate absolutely everything! And... I was faster than you, Kanna!
SK0402,636,Heheheh... But the victory still goes to me.
SK0402,637,Huh? But wait, you're still eating, aren't you?
SK0402,638,I'm eating six servings, Boss.
SK0402,639,Wh...what? Are you serious?!
SK0402,640,...I admit defeat. There's no way in hell I can match up to you, Kanna.
SK0402,641,There! Three servings, polished off!
SK0402,642,Whaaa? You ate it all already?!
SK0402,643,Heheh, eating this amount was child's play.
SK0402,644,You were so close, too...but you did great to scarf down as much as you did!
SK0402,645,So you couldn't quite finish 3 servings...and here I thought you could go a little farther.
SK0402,646,What the heck, Boss? You ate way less than I figured you could.
SK0402,647,Kanna...just how on earth can you eat this much food?!
SK0402,648,Well...good food is easy to eat. I guess that's my secret?
SK0402,649,Gah...That's not a secret at all!
SK0402,650,Hey Boss, your stomach doin' okay?
SK0402,651,Yeah...I think I'll pull through.
SK0402,652,In any case...you're something special all right, Kanna.
SK0402,653,Speak for yourself! I bet if you pushed a little harder, you could eat even more!
SK0402,654,But I guess the victory goes to me this time around!
SK0402,655,I feel like my stomach's gotten a bit bigger after all that eating.
SK0402,656,Well, I should get going...but my body feels...kinda heavy...
SK0402,657,All the tableware from our eating contest earlier have been put neatly away.
SK0402,658,Kanna is just incredible. She ate all that food and still managed to clean up afterwards.
SK0402,659,We're between performances, so there aren't any patrons here.
SK0402,660,None of the Flower Division members are here, either. I should head elsewhere.
SK0402,661,If I recall, Maria is scheduled to return this month.
SK0402,662,We haven't heard from her, but...this is Maria we're talking about, so I'm sure she's fine.
SK0402,663,We're not doing a performance this month, so there aren't any patrons around.
SK0402,664,There's really no point in being here. I'll go somewhere else.
SK0402,665,Everyone who saw King Lear looked pretty happy with it.
SK0402,666,Turns out it wasn't a bad idea at all to make such a drastic change to the story.
SK0402,667,Still, it was a zoo in here last month when it came time for the play.
SK0402,668,I could barely keep up when it came to punching tickets. I'd better get some practice in...
SK0402,669,King Lear was such a hit last summer, it was standing room only.
SK0402,670,I hope our fall performance does just as well...
SK0402,671,Looks like no one's here. Where did everyone go?
SK0402,672,Nobody here...looks like they're taking a day off from rehearsal.
SK0402,673,Guess I should head to another room, anyway.
SK0402,674,Come to think of it, Sakura's the one in charge of cleaning around here.
SK0402,675,Every nook and cranny is cleaned to a shine. That's Sakura for you. 
SK0402,676,It can't be easy organizing all these costumes, either. They have to be aired out on occasion to keep bugs at bay...
SK0402,677,There really are a whole lot of costumes here, though...Just how many do we have?
SK0402,678,No one's here. I guess this room doesn't see much use outside of performances.
SK0402,679,Guess I should head to another room, anyway.
SK0402,680,When Mr. Yoneda was still here, we had a lot of VIP patrons coming through.
SK0402,681,Nobody's around. I'll go somewhere else.
SK0402,682,It's empty. No one usually comes here during their free time.
SK0402,683,Oh well. Guess I'll check someplace else.
SK0402,684,There doesn't seem to be anyone on the terrace.
SK0402,685,Since the rain's finally stopped...
SK0402,686,...maybe I'll go to the courtyard and visit [dog].
SK0402,687,I figured I'd check again, but there's still no one here...
SK0402,688,Oh yeah, Kohran was asking for me, wasn't she? I'd best not be late.
SK0402,689,...
SK0402,690,(It looks like Orihime is back.)
SK0402,691,(I wonder what she's always doing here?)
SK0402,692,Mamma...
SK0402,693,Hm?
SK0402,694,Mamma, it has been 3 months now since I came here to Japan.
SK0402,695,At first, I thought that it would be a terrible place...
SK0402,696,...because this is where HE was born, after all.
SK0402,697,But I am starting to feel that, just maybe...it is not so bad after all.
SK0402,698,My captain may be a busybody, but the theater is a fairly comfortable place to stay.
SK0402,699,In the beginning, I wanted to run back home as soon as I could...but I have decided to stay a little longer.
SK0402,700,I hope you are well, Mamma. I'm just fine, so you take care of yourself...
SK0402,701,(Orihime...)
SK0402,702,Say something.
SK0402,703,...I should leave her be.
SK0402,704,Orihime...
SK0402,705,...!
SK0402,706,E-Ensign! Just how long have you been there?!
SK0402,707,S-sorry...I didn't mean to eavesdrop.
SK0402,708,You certainly do love to eavesdrop, don't you?! Just like usual!
SK0402,709,Japanese men are all sneaky little cowards, after all!
SK0402,710,I do not wish to see your face any longer! Now, get out of my way!
SK0402,711,Wait, Orihime...
SK0402,712,Well, eavesdropping isn't exactly something to be commended for. Guess there's nothing else I can say.
SK0402,713,(...I should leave her be. It wouldn't be right to bother her.)
SK0402,714,(Still, I never expected to see this side of Orihime...)
SK0402,715,Well now, I should be on my way.
SK0402,716,(Oh, shoot! I gotta get out of here!)
SK0402,717,Oh, Ensign. Whatever could you be doing here?
SK0402,718,I-I could ask you the same thing.
SK0402,719,Oh, me? I need to have a quick word with you.
SK0402,720,Though I am thinking you have no idea what you're talking about.
SK0402,721,Now if you will pardon me. Please, enjoy yourself!
SK0402,722,Orihime...so that's what you're always doing here.
SK0402,723,Huh? I thought Orihime was here, but...
SK0402,724,Maybe I'll come back later...
SK0402,725,There's no one in the attic. Not like anyone would come up here, though.
SK0402,726,Oh well. I'll go try another room.
SK0402,727,Oh, hey there, Iris.
SK0402,728,Ah, Mon Frere!
SK0402,729,What are you up to? Searching for a book?
SK0402,730,Um...Miss Kaede gave me a workbook, so I'm studying.
SK0402,731,But the problems are all in Japanese, so I came to get a dictionary to look up the words I don't know.
SK0402,732,Is that so? You're amazing, Iris.
SK0402,733,Mon Frere...I get kind of...sleepy whenever I study.
SK0402,734,Hahaha...keep it up, Iris. Studying is important.
SK0402,735,...Yeah. Okay, I'm gonna keep studying for a little longer.
SK0402,736,Iris is studying...maybe I should drop in on her room to see how she's doing.
SK0402,737,Nobody's here.
SK0402,738,I'll try somewhere else. Maybe where everyone else seems to be going...
SK0402,739,Iris... Is she inside?
SK0402,740,So Iris's nameplate is shaped like Jean-Paul...
SK0402,741,I better check another room, I guess.
SK0402,742,It's Ogami. Are you there, Iris?
SK0402,743,Yes, I am.
SK0402,744,I'm studying right now. But it's so hard, it's making my head hurt...
SK0402,745,Mind if I help you?
SK0402,746,Really? You'd help me out?
SK0402,747,Sure. Though I don't know how much help I'll really be.
SK0402,748,Then come on in! Yaaay, Mon Frere is gonna study with me!
SK0402,749,Welcome to my room!
SK0402,750,Thanks. By the way, what are you studying?
SK0402,751,Today, I'm learning some new Japanese words.
SK0402,752,Language studies, then? That does seem like it'd be a bit tough for you.
SK0402,753,I'll be okay! I have you helping me, after all!
SK0402,754,Hahaha...I hope I live up to your expectations.
SK0402,755,Let's get started, then.
SK0402,756,Yeah!
SK0402,757,Hmm...
SK0402,758,Hey Mon Frere, what's a "three-legged race"?
SK0402,759,How does two people equal three legs? Shouldn't they have four?
SK0402,760,Well, you see...
SK0402,761,Demonstrate with your legs.
SK0402,762,Draw a picture.
SK0402,763,Use an allegory.
SK0402,764,Hmm, I think it may be easier to show you.
SK0402,765,...Huh? Hey, whatcha doing?
SK0402,766,Let's see, if I wrap this string around my right leg and your left leg...
SK0402,767,There. If you combine both of our legs together like this, it makes a single leg.
SK0402,768,Wooow, you're right! There's two of us, but we have three legs!
SK0402,769,When people try to race this way, it's called a three-legged race.
SK0402,770,We also use the term in Japanese to mean when two people work together towards a common goal.
SK0402,771,Hmm...I'll draw you a picture.
SK0402,772,Okay, here we have two people.
SK0402,773,Hey, Mon Frere...what is this?
SK0402,774,Huh? It's supposed to be a person...
SK0402,775,Kyahaha! It kinda looks like a monkey!
SK0402,776,A-a monkey? But I tried so hard to draw this...
SK0402,777,Ah, never mind. If you tie two of their legs together, it creates one leg.
SK0402,778,Wow! So two monkeys' legs put together becomes one leg!
SK0402,779,I get it! When two people work together, it's the same as a three-legged race!
SK0402,780,W-well, yes, but...um, are you sure you understand it correctly?
SK0402,781,Well now...let's say you have an old man and woman.
SK0402,782,There's a huge carrot growing in their field out back, but neither one of them can pull it out alone.
SK0402,783,So if the two of them work together and give it a good, hard yank, they can harvest it.
SK0402,784,Oh, I see! So a three-legged race means when you need to harvest carrots, you should do it with two people!
SK0402,785,Umm, that's not quite what it means, but I guess that is the general idea...
SK0402,786,Hmm, could a three-legged race be like when two people work together on something...?
SK0402,787,Yes! That's exactly right, Iris! Nicely done.
SK0402,788,Hee hee. I got it right! Hooray!
SK0402,789,Hey Mon Frere, let's keep doing more!
SK0402,790,All right then. On the the next problem!
SK0402,791,Mon Frere...I can't keep going. I'm too sleepy...
SK0402,792,Just one more, Iris. Come on, keep your head up!
SK0402,793,Let's do it later, okay...?
SK0402,794,Just push through it!
SK0402,795,Guess we should stop.
SK0402,796,Just push through it! One more problem. Come on, Iris!
SK0402,797,...Okay, okay. You're so strict, Mon Frere.
SK0402,798,I guess we should stop, then. We'll finish the rest later.
SK0402,799,Yaaay! All done, all done!
SK0402,800,You have to do it properly!
SK0402,801,You didn't answer, so I decided I'm finished!
SK0402,802,Good grief...I guess there's no point in pushing it, so we might as well leave off there.
SK0402,803,Well, looks like you're done studying for today. Nice job, Iris.
SK0402,804,Uh-huh! Thanks, Mon Frère!
SK0402,805,Leave the room.
SK0402,806,Praise her.
SK0402,807,Give her homework.
SK0402,808,I'll head off, then. See you later.
SK0402,809,Let's study again another time!
SK0402,810,Phew...I'm actually kind of tired.
SK0402,811,I am doing this for Iris, though. I should keep checking in on her every now and then.
SK0402,812,You worked really hard today, Iris. You did fantastic.
SK0402,813,Really? Cause it was so much fun studying with you!
SK0402,814,Let's study again another time!
SK0402,815,Hahaha, I see. Okay, I'll be off for now.
SK0402,816,Phew...I'm actually kind of tired.
SK0402,817,I am doing this for Iris, though. I should keep checking in on her every now and then.
SK0402,818,All right, here's your homework. Finish up to this page by next time.
SK0402,819,Huh?! Mon Frere, you're awful!
SK0402,820,It's important to do a little more each and every day. Understand?
SK0402,821,Oookaaay. Aww, I hate this...
SK0402,822,Phew...I'm actually kind of tired.
SK0402,823,I am doing this for Iris, though. I should keep checking in on her every now and then.
SK0402,824,Iris...looks like you're drifting off again.
SK0402,825,I should be going. See you later, Iris.
SK0402,826,Okay...goodnight.
SK0402,827,Phew...I'm actually kind of tired.
SK0402,828,I am doing this for Iris, though. I should keep checking in on her every now and then.
SK0402,829,Iris... Is she inside?
SK0402,830,So Iris's nameplate is shaped like Jean-Paul...
SK0402,831,I better check another room, I guess.
SK0402,832,Snoooore... Snooore...
SK0402,833,Hahaha, I see she's taking a nap. All that studying earlier must've tired her out.
SK0402,834,Iris... Is she inside?
SK0402,835,So Iris's nameplate is shaped like Jean-Paul...
SK0402,836,I better check another room, I guess.
SK0402,837,Snoooore... Snooore...
SK0402,838,Iris... Is she inside?
SK0402,839,So Iris's nameplate is shaped like Jean-Paul...
SK0402,840,I better check another room, I guess.
SK0402,841,It doesn't seem like Iris is in there.
SK0402,842,Why Ensign, is that you?
SK0402,843,Hi there, Sumire. Having some tea?
SK0402,844,Indeed. And the tea we have here is exceptional. Today I am drinking what's called Russian tea.
SK0402,845,In order to make it, you must add a certain ingredient to black tea. Would you happen to know what it is?
SK0402,846,Sugar?
SK0402,847,Salt?
SK0402,848,Soy sauce?
SK0402,849,Milk?
SK0402,850,Jam?
SK0402,851,Butter?
SK0402,852,Um...sugar?
SK0402,856,Salt, maybe?
SK0402,857,For heaven's sake, would you at least try to answer seriously?
SK0402,858,Russian tea is black tea flavored with jam.
SK0402,863,Russian tea is black tea flavored with jam.
SK0402,866,I know! It's milk, right?
SK0402,868,Russian tea is black tea flavored with jam.
SK0402,870,S-Sorry.
SK0402,871,I know! Jam, right?!
SK0402,872,But of course you would know, Ensign.
SK0402,873,When jam is added to black tea, we call it Russian tea.
SK0402,874,I know! Butter, right?!
SK0402,875,For heaven's sake, would you at least try to answer seriously?
SK0402,876,Russian tea is black tea flavored with jam.
SK0402,891,Pour the tea.
SK0402,892,Pour the water.
SK0402,893,Pour the tea.
SK0402,894,Pour the water.
SK0402,895,For starters, you pour the tea into the cup.
SK0402,909,Take care, Ensign.
SK0402,910,You wait a little bit, then pour the tea.
SK0402,919,You were doing it in the correct order, but you took a little too long.
SK0402,926,Thank you, Sumire. That was quite educational.
SK0402,933,Sure. Thanks, Sumire.
SK0402,940,This is Kaede's room.
SK0402,941,I better check another room, I guess.
SK0402,942,It's Ogami. Are you there, Kaede?
SK0402,943,Oh, Ogami? Just a moment.
SK0402,944,Come on in.
SK0402,945,Sorry to drop by unannounced.
SK0402,946,I've never seen you wear that outfit before, but it really suits you.
SK0402,947,Oh my, thank you.
SK0402,950,Um... I thought, if you wanted, maybe we could chat for a bit...
SK0402,951,That sounds perfect. I've been wanting to speak with you, as well.
SK0402,952,Come on in, then. No need to be modest.
SK0402,953,C-Certainly. Pardon me.
SK0402,954,Wow... So this is your room, Kaede?
SK0402,956,I'm sure it must have a completely different atmosphere from my sister's room, right?
SK0402,957,Yes. Ayame's room had a very Japanese feel to it.
SK0402,958,Hahaha, that sounds about right. She was always one to prefer a more Japanese style...
SK0402,959,But as for myself, I like Western designs. Even though we're sisters, we were quite different.
SK0402,960,By the way, what did you wish to discuss, Ogami?
SK0402,961,Oh, um... Would it be all right if I asked you something?
SK0402,962,What is it? I'll answer if I can.
SK0402,964,Haha, you want to know that?
SK0402,965,Let me turn the question around. Why did you join the Imperial Assault Troupe, Ogami?
SK0402,966,To ensure peace in the capital.
SK0402,967,I was assigned to it.
SK0402,968,To ensure peace in the capital.
SK0402,969,I was assigned to it.
SK0402,971,To ensure peace in the capital, of course.
SK0402,977,OK.
SK0402,991,If you ever want to hear more about Ayame, come by again anytime.
SK0402,992,All right. Well, I should get going. Please excuse me.
SK0402,993,I'm glad I had a chance to speak with Kaede. Maybe I'll make an effort to drop by and see her sometimes.
SK0402,994,This is Kaede's room.
SK0402,995,I better check another room, I guess.
SK0402,996,It's Ogami. Are you there, Kaede?
SK0402,997,Oh, Ogami.
SK0402,998,I'm sorry, but I still have reports to write.
SK0402,999,I see. Then I'll see you in another time.
SK0402,1000,Sorry, Ogami. Let's sit down and chat some other time.
SK0402,1001,Now, what should I do...
SK0402,1002,Make a call.
SK0402,1003,Maybe next time.
SK0402,1004,OK, I'll make a call.
SK0402,1005,I'll call someone another time. Maybe I'll head somewhere else for now.
SK0402,1006,There's no one here... Where did everyone go?
SK0402,1007,Maybe they're spending time with [dog]? Hmm... I'll try somewhere else.
SK0402,1008,The sunlight here is so bright. It's nice and warm.
SK0402,1009,Well, I guess I'll keep going since there's nobody here.
SK0402,1010,The other day, Yuri told me that these VIP seats are 15 yen per ticket...
SK0402,1011,Still, the fact that these seats are always filled just shows how popular the Flower Division is.
SK0402,1012,No one's here. I'll try somewhere else.
SK0402,1013,Billiards and darts, huh? I seem to remember Kayama being pretty skilled at these.
SK0402,1014,Heh...this really takes me back to my days at the Naval Academy.
SK0402,1015,Come to think of it, I've never spent any time in here before.
SK0402,1016,I'd like to try playing billiards with someone.
SK0402,1017,If I recall, Maria is supposed to return this month.
SK0402,1018,Come back soon, Maria...
SK0402,1019,It's Maria's nameplate.
SK0402,1020,There's no reason to hang around since Maria's gone. I'll go somewhere else.
SK0402,1021,I wonder if Reni's here.
SK0402,1022,Nope, not here.
SK0402,1023,It's just a piece of paper from a notebook. I suppose that's fitting for someone like Reni.
SK0402,1024,OK, let's check another room.
SK0402,1025,I wonder if Sakura's in her room?
SK0402,1026,Too bad, she's not here.
SK0402,1027,It's just like Sakura to have a cute nameplate like this.
SK0402,1028,Let's go check another room.
SK0402,1029,I wonder if Kanna is inside.
SK0402,1030,...She's not here.
SK0402,1031,A nametag hangs on the door, almost as if it's standing guard over Kanna's room in her absence.
SK0402,1032,OK, let's check another room.
SK0402,1033,I wonder if Sumire is inside.
SK0402,1034,Nope, not here.
SK0402,1035,This is a pretty subtle design, considering it's Sumire.
SK0402,1036,Let's check another room.
SK0402,1037,I wonder if Orihime is in her room?
SK0402,1038,Seems she's not in.
SK0402,1039,The nameplate has a simple design, but it sure looks high class.
SK0402,1040,Let's go check another room.
SK0402,1041,I wonder just what Kohran wants to speak with me about.
SK0402,1042,We promised to meet at 4. It's a little early still.
SK0402,1043,A gear-shaped nameplate, huh? It's just Kohran's style.
SK0402,1044,Maybe I'll come back after I've wandered around a bit more.
SK0402,1045,Huh? Looks like someone's in the bathroom.
SK0402,1046,That looks like...the summer dress that Sakura was wearing...
SK0402,1047,Wh-Which means right now, Sakura is in there.
SK0402,1048,My body is moving towards the bathroom on its own...
SK0402,1049,Go back outside.
SK0402,1050,Oh no, my body is moving towards the bathroom on its own...
SK0402,1051,Ahh, this feels great... So refreshing after getting soaked by the rain.
SK0402,1052,And I'm so happy Ogami said I looked good in that dress...
SK0402,1053,(Sakura...)
SK0402,1054,(C-Crap!)
SK0402,1055,...! I-is someone there?!
SK0402,1056,Make an excuse.
SK0402,1057,Run away.
SK0402,1058,Make an excuse.
SK0402,1059,S-Sakura...I can explain, really.
SK0402,1060,O-Ogami!!
SK0402,1061,Eeeeeek! Get out of here!
SK0402,1062,Um, but I just-
SK0402,1063,I don't care, just get out! Now!
SK0402,1064,R-right!
SK0402,1065,...
SK0402,1066,Sorry for just bumbling inside like that, Sakura...
SK0402,1067,I guess it's fine since you really didn't mean to...
SK0402,1068,...but please be more careful from now on.
SK0402,1069,Yeah...I really shouldn't have done that.
SK0402,1070,(I gotta get out of here before she sees me!)
SK0402,1071,Phew... I think I got away before she realized I was there.
SK0402,1072,If I'd been just a moment slower, I might not have made it. That was too close.
SK0402,1073,Eeeek! O-Ogami?!
SK0402,1074,(Crap! No use in running now!)
SK0402,1075,Eeeeeek! Get out of here!
SK0402,1076,Sorry! Leaving now!
SK0402,1077,...
SK0402,1078,Sorry for just bumbling inside like that, Sakura...
SK0402,1079,I guess it's fine since you really didn't mean to...
SK0402,1080,...but please be more careful from now on.
SK0402,1081,Now if you'll excuse me, I need to do my sword training.
SK0402,1082,Yeah...I really shouldn't have done that.
SK0402,1083,(I've gotta get out of here before Sakura finds me.)
SK0402,1084,Phew... Looks like she didn't see me.
SK0402,1085,I can't be peeping in the baths like this. I'd better stop here.
SK0402,1086,Ahh, I feel brand-new... I guess I'd better get out.
SK0402,1087,(Oh, crap!! It looks like she's getting out of the water!)
SK0402,1088,(I gotta get out of here before she sees me!)
SK0402,1089,Phew... I think I got away before she realized I was there.
SK0402,1090,If I'd been just a moment slower, I might not have made it. That was too close.
SK0402,1091,Oh, Ogami. Are you here to bathe?
SK0402,1092,N-No... That's not it.
SK0402,1093,You know, you did get pretty wet in the rain earlier.
SK0402,1094,Why not take a bath to warm up so you don't catch a cold?
SK0402,1095,G-good idea. Thanks, Sakura.
SK0402,1096,I'd better be going. See you later.
SK0402,1097,Yeah...a bath doesn't sound too bad.
SK0402,1098,Get in the bath.
SK0402,1099,Go somewhere else.
SK0402,1100,OK, I think I will take a bath.
SK0402,1101,I don't have time to lounge in here all day... But a short, relaxing bath would be nice.
SK0402,1102,Phew... Ohh, this feels great.
SK0402,1103,The injury I got from rescuing [dog] is even starting to hurt less.
SK0402,1104,Having this huge bath to soak in all to myself is seriously heaven on earth...
SK0402,1105,Now that I'm nice and warmed up, I guess it's time to get out.
SK0402,1106,Ahh... That was a nice bath.
SK0402,1107,15 minutes went by before I even realized.
SK0402,1108,I might've lazed around for just a bit too long, though. OK, time to go.
SK0402,1109,I don't really have time to keep relaxing. I should head somewhere else.
SK0402,1110,A bath, huh? I guess I did get caught in a downpour on the way to the hospital.
SK0402,1111,Wouldn't hurt to warm myself up a little.
SK0402,1112,Get in the bath.
SK0402,1113,Go somewhere else.
SK0402,1114,All right, I'll hop in the bath.
SK0402,1115,I don't have time to lounge in here all day... But a short, relaxing bath would be nice.
SK0402,1116,Phew... Ohh, this feels great.
SK0402,1117,The injury I got from rescuing [dog] is even starting to hurt less.
SK0402,1118,Having this huge bath to soak in all to myself is seriously heaven on earth...
SK0402,1119,Now that I'm nice and warmed up, I guess it's time to get out.
SK0402,1120,Ahh... That was a nice bath.
SK0402,1121,15 minutes went by before I even realized.
SK0402,1122,I might've lazed around for just a bit too long, though. OK, time to go.
SK0402,1123,I don't really have time to keep relaxing. I should head somewhere else.
SK0402,1124,Looks like there's no one here.
SK0402,1125,I took a bath already, so there's no need for me to be here.
SK0402,1126,Heya, Chief. What're you up to way over here?
SK0402,1127,I could ask you the same thing.
SK0402,1128,Who, me? Just running an analysis on some materials for my next big invention.
SK0402,1129,Just as I'd expect from you.
SK0402,1130,What kind of invention?
SK0402,1131,Just as I'd expect from you.
SK0402,1132,What was that secret project of yours?
SK0402,1133,Just as I'd expect from you.
SK0402,1134,What kind of invention?
SK0402,1135,Just as I'd expect from you, Kohran. You barely made it through the front door before starting on your next invention.
SK0402,1136,Ahh Chief, you can't just whisper sweet nothings at me like that!
SK0402,1140,So, what kind of invention is it?
SK0402,1141,Heheheh...sorry, but that's my little secret.
SK0402,1142,You'll get to see it soon enough, so keep your eyes peeled!
SK0402,1143,Oh right, I just remembered! What exactly was that secret project you were working on?
SK0402,1144,Oop...w-well, uh... Dang it, your memory's too good, Chief.
SK0402,1153,...
SK0402,1154,...? Got some deep thoughts rattling around in there, Chief?
SK0402,1155,No... I just feel bad for coming here and disturbing your work.
SK0402,1156,No need to tiptoe around me, you know. It's nothing world-shattering, after all.
SK0402,1157,Hokay, analysis complete! I'd better make like a tree and leave.
SK0402,1158,Sure. Best of luck with your invention.
SK0402,1159,Thank you kindly. I'll see you in my room at 4, and don't be late!
SK0402,1160,A new invention, huh? What in the world could it be?
SK0402,1161,Well, I'm sure she'll show it to me sooner or later. I ought to get going, too.
SK0402,1162,The heat from the steam processor make this room hotter than other rooms.
SK0402,1163,Crap, I'm sweating. What am I doing here when it's this hot out, anyway?
SK0402,1164,Whoa! R-Reni! Why are you naked?!
SK0402,1165,I'm swimming.
SK0402,1166,Reni...
SK0402,1167,Sorry, I'm leaving right now!
SK0402,1168,Put on a swimsuit!
SK0402,1169,Sorry, I'm leaving right now!
SK0402,1170,Put on a swimsuit!
SK0402,1171,Sorry, I'm leaving right now!
SK0402,1172,Put on a swimsuit!
SK0402,1173,...Maybe I'll swim, too.
SK0402,1174,S-sorry! I'm leaving right now!
SK0402,1175,...
SK0402,1176,Please excuse me!
SK0402,1177,Huff... Huff... I thought my heart was gonna pop out of my chest.
SK0402,1178,Still though...somehow, it doesn't surprise me all that much to see Reni swimming naked.
SK0402,1179,R-Reni, put on a swimsuit!
SK0402,1180,...a swimsuit?
SK0402,1181,Swimming without clothing is more efficient, as it reduces the drag from the water.
SK0402,1182,That may be, but swimming naked while other people are around is asking for trouble!
SK0402,1183,So unless you wanna cause a scene, you need to wear a swimsuit!
SK0402,1184,...Understood. I will do so from now on.
SK0402,1185,Y-you get it, right? Then I'm leaving now!
SK0402,1186,Huff...huff... I thought my heart was gonna pop out of my chest.
SK0402,1187,Still though...somehow, it doesn't surprise me all that much to see Reni swimming without a swimsuit.
SK0402,1188,...Maybe I'll swim, too. Want to swim together, Reni?
SK0402,1189,I'm done swimming, now.
SK0402,1190,I-I see...oh well.
SK0402,1191,I guess I'll be going, then. See you, Reni.
SK0402,1192,Oh man. I wish I hadn't put my foot in my mouth.
SK0402,1193,Still though...somehow, it doesn't surprise me all that much to see Reni swimming naked.
SK0402,1194,Did you need something?
SK0402,1195,N-no, I...was just taken aback...
SK0402,1196,Listen Reni, you really ought to wear something when you go swimming.
SK0402,1197,Swimming without clothing is more efficient, as it reduces the drag from the water.
SK0402,1198,That may be, but swimming naked while other people are around is asking for trouble!
SK0402,1199,So unless you wanna cause a scene, you need to wear a swimsuit!
SK0402,1200,...Understood. I will do so from now on.
SK0402,1201,Y-you get it, right? Then I'm leaving now!
SK0402,1202,Huff...huff... I thought my heart was gonna pop out of my chest.
SK0402,1203,Still though...somehow, it doesn't surprise me all that much to see Reni swimming naked.
SK0402,1204,Hey, Reni. Getting some swim practice in?
SK0402,1205,...
SK0402,1206,Wait...are you naked?
SK0402,1207,I know it feels nice to swim naked, but you ought to at least wear some swim shorts.
SK0402,1208,Swimming without clothing is more efficient, as it reduces the drag from the water.
SK0402,1209,Maybe so, but it could cause trouble if one of the female troop members saw you this way.
SK0402,1210,...
SK0402,1211,Come to think of it... I've always thought your body seemed pretty feminine, Reni.
SK0402,1212,Looking at your chest now, it seems rounded enough that you might have b...
SK0402,1213,...b-b-breasts?!
SK0402,1214,R-Reni...are you...a g-girl?
SK0402,1215,...Yes.
SK0402,1216,Wh-Whaaaaaaaatttt!?
SK0402,1217,Leave immediately.
SK0402,1218,Shut your eyes.
SK0402,1219,I-I'm sorry! I just barged in here without knowing that you're female...
SK0402,1220,It's fine. No need to apologize.
SK0402,1221,There are still some functional differences between male and female.
SK0402,1222,A-Anyway, I'm leaving right now. Sorry for barging in!!
SK0402,1223,Huff...huff... I thought my heart was gonna pop out of my chest.
SK0402,1224,But still... To think that Reni is a girl... Hmm...
SK0402,1225,I suppose she never did specifically say that she was a boy...
SK0402,1226,But still, how did a girl her age learn combat techniques like that?
SK0402,1227,R-Reni! I closed my eyes, so I didn't see anything!
SK0402,1228,OK... I'm leaving right away.
SK0402,1229,Yeeeowch! Damn, who put a wall here?
SK0402,1230,The door is a bit more to your right.
SK0402,1231,Th-thanks. And, erm...sorry, Reni.
SK0402,1232,Huff...huff... I thought my heart was gonna pop out of my chest.
SK0402,1233,But still... To think that Reni is a girl... Hmm...
SK0402,1234,I suppose she never did specifically say that she was a boy...
SK0402,1235,But still, how did a girl her age learn combat techniques like that?
SK0402,1236,I'm done swimming. The pool is all yours.
SK0402,1237,O-oh no, I wasn't...
SK0402,1238,A-Anyway, I'm leaving right now. Sorry for barging in!!
SK0402,1239,Huff...huff... I thought my heart was gonna pop out of my chest.
SK0402,1240,But still... To think that Reni is a girl... Hmm...
SK0402,1241,How did a girl her age learn so much about combat and warfare?
SK0402,1242,I don't think she would tell me, even if I asked her... Just one mystery after another with her.
SK0402,1243,Reni...
SK0402,1244,I'm done changing. I'll be on my way.
SK0402,1245,I've done this not just once, but twice now... I'm sorry, Reni.
SK0402,1246,It's fine.
SK0402,1247,I will be sure to wear a swimsuit from now on.
SK0402,1248,I wouldn't wish to cause a scene.
SK0402,1249,I-I think that's for the best, yeah.
SK0402,1250,I'll be on my way.
SK0402,1251,Sigh... Same as ever, I see.
SK0402,1252,Why am I just standing around here, anyway? I'd better get going, too.
SK0402,1253,...
SK0402,1254,Reni...
SK0402,1255,Sorry about earlier.
SK0402,1256,So you're a girl.
SK0402,1257,Sorry about earlier.
SK0402,1258,It's cute when you put it that way.
SK0402,1259,I'm sorry about the earlier. I didn't realize that you're... a girl.
SK0402,1260,It's fine.
SK0402,1261,Um... I suppose you'd prefer I kept this a secret from the others?
SK0402,1262,I don't mind if you tell them. It's all the same to me.
SK0402,1263,One's biological sex makes no difference in battle.
SK0402,1264,Reni...
SK0402,1265,Well, I was just...surprised to learn that you're a girl.
SK0402,1266,No one ever asked, so I never mentioned it.
SK0402,1267,One's biological sex makes no difference in battle.
SK0402,1268,Reni...
SK0402,1269,It's kind of cute when you put it that way.
SK0402,1270,Cute?
SK0402,1271,Is that... a good thing?
SK0402,1272,Y-Yeah... I was trying to praise you, here.
SK0402,1273,OK, I'll take that as a good thing.
SK0402,1274,So Reni is a girl, huh...
SK0402,1275,I don't know how should I say this... but somehow, I'm happy.
SK0402,1276,If you got nothing to say, I'm leaving.
SK0402,1277,Ah, R-Reni!
SK0402,1278,I should've just come out and apologized to her.
SK0402,1279,No one's here. I wouldn't mind a dip in the pool myself, since summertime is here.
SK0402,1280,I don't have my swimsuit on me, so maybe next time.
SK0402,1281,Oh, Chief.
SK0402,1282,Hey Kohran. Come to check on the koubu?
SK0402,1283,You betcha!
SK0402,1285,I'm back, my little koubu. Let's keep working our hardest, you and me.
SK0402,1286,Good to meet you, Eisenkleids. I'm Kohran Li.
SK0402,1289,You sure do love machines.
SK0402,1290,You're talking to them?
SK0402,1291,Kohran...you sure do love machines.
SK0402,1297,Kohran...
SK0402,1298,Kohran...are you talking to them?
SK0402,1303,Hahaha, OK.
SK0402,1311,Well... I ought to get going, myself.
SK0402,1323,I'll just go somewhere else.
SK0402,1338,Oh well, I'll check another room.
SK0402,1346,There's no use of standing idly in here. Let's move to another room.
SK0402,1349,Mon frèèèère!
SK0402,1350,Hey, Iris, what's up?
SK0402,1367,O-Oh... Is that so...
SK0402,1373,S-Sorry.
SK0402,1387,Is that so? You're amazing, Iris.
SK0402,1398,Yeah, I'm sure of it.
SK0402,1402,Hmmm.. what should I do?
SK0402,1404,Sure, what is it?
SK0402,1406,Iris...
SK0402,1411,Yeah!
SK0402,1416,Kohran must have been waiting in her room! I gotta get hurry!
SK0402,1418,It's Ogami.
SK0402,1475,Eeep?!
SK0402,1477,Tell me some gossip.
SK0402,1478,I'll come back later.
SK0402,1479,Seems like you started to keep a dog in the courtyard, Ogami.
SK0402,1480,You're right. Sorry I didn't ask your thoughts about it before.
SK0402,1481,Oh, not at all! So, that dog's name is <name>
SK0402,1482,isn't it?
SK0402,1483,Quick of getting info as usual, Yuri.
SK0402,1484,Ufufu. Actually, Kohran just drop here and tell us about it. She was really happy about it.
SK0402,1485,Well, great to that.
SK0402,1486,I hope you guys can come play with him sometimes.
SK0402,1487,Has Manager Yoneda been doing OK?
SK0402,1488,Yeah. We just visited him in the hospital, and he was already lively.
SK0402,1489,He's not allowed to drink sake while in there, so it must have been a good chance for his body to heal too.
SK0402,1490,Well, it's the manager we're talking about. There's a chance that he secretly drinking too.
SK0402,1491,I heard from Kanna that recently some foods in the kitchen have gone!
SK0402,1492,Huh!? D-Don't tell me there are rats?
SK0402,1493,Maybe not. Those foods are gone along with its bag, too.
SK0402,1494,Don't you think that there's someone we don't know who might live in here too?
SK0402,1495,Just kidding. Doesn't it frightens you?
SK0402,1496,Oh right, Ogami, have you ever been to Café Paulista before?
SK0402,1497,Eh, Cafe... What was it? No, I haven't.
SK0402,1498,They have delicious coffee and donuts!
SK0402,1499,It's a wonderful cafe, many authors and playwrights visited there frequentlty.
SK0402,1500,Whenever I go there, I got a little tired for hearing difficult conversations though.
SK0402,1501,By the way, I heard that there are some female bus conductors these days!
SK0402,1502,It's cool to see working women among men. 
SK0402,1503,I admire them for a bit.
SK0402,1504,Now that we're talking about it, you're working among women too, right?
SK0402,1505,By the way, Maria is scheduled to return soon, isn't she?
SK0402,1506,Huh, is that so? Having her return is a relief for me.
SK0402,1507,You look happy to hear that, Ogami. Were you lonely because Maria is away?
SK0402,1508,I-It's not like that. I'm just happy that I got another comrade in Flower Division that she'll return soon.
SK0402,1509,It's quite hard for me to keep an eye on every member by myself.
SK0402,1510,I see. It does seems really hard to keep everyone together by yourself.
SK0402,1511,That reminds me, recently people say that they saw a person with a guitar in here.
SK0402,1512,Sometimes there's even sounds of guitar and someone's singing too.
SK0402,1513,Apparently they not seem to be from the theater's orchestra.
SK0402,1514,If their identity is revealed, I'll you right away.
SK0402,1515,O-OK... Thanks.
SK0402,1516,Speaking of which, Summer break is coming on next month, isn't it?
SK0402,1517,I'm thinking of buying a brand new swimsuit and go to the beach! How about we're going together, Kasumi?
SK0402,1518,Uh? I think I'll pass... Anyway, do you have any plans for Summer break, Ogami?
SK0402,1519,Uh... Our job doesn't have any day off, let alone Summer break..
SK0402,1520,Sorry Ogami, but I'm all out of gossip for now.
SK0402,1521,I'll have some more interesting tidbits for you another time, so look forward to it!
SK0402,1522,Oh, Ogami, have you bought Maria's photo?
SK0402,1523,Since she's in America, I thought that at least I can get her photo, so...
SK0402,1524,How about I tell you Maria's call number, Ogami?
SK0402,1525,I-Is it OK?
SK0402,1526,She already gave me her number in case of emergency.
SK0402,1527,but you can talk to her if you call to, "13900."
SK0402,1528,13900", isn't it? OK, Yuri. Thanks!
SK0402,1529,I'll be back. Good luck with your work.
SK0402,1530,OK. Thanks for today, Ogami.
SK0402,1531,Tell me if you got some new gossips!
SK0402,1532,Sorry Ogami, but each customer is only allowed to purchase one photo at a time.
SK0402,1533,I see. That's too bad...
SK0402,1534,My apologies Ogami, but each customer is only allowed to purchase one photo at a time.
SK0402,1535,Oh, really? That's too bad...

SK0402,1560,Divine sword Shirohatori. Entrusted to me by Kaede. A secret sword passed down in the Fujieda family.

SK0402,1600,A scarf given to me by Sakura. It's knitted with yellow yarn - my favorite color.
SK0402,1601,Ayame and I almost never had a chance to live together, even though we're sister.
SK0402,1602,Eh...?
SK0402,1603,That's not so unusual. Our family tree is more like a wisteria with the way we're connected.
SK0402,1604,But I always had a feeling that would sacrifice herself at any time,
SK0402,1605,and carrying all the burdens by herself.
SK0402,1606,When I heard the news that she's gone, I had a thought that I want to carry her will.
SK0402,1607,I want to protect the peace that we have in Tokyo just like her.
SK0402,1608,And for my own sake, too.
SK0402,1609,That's all from me.
SK0402,1610,You know, I came here to work by my own will.
SK0402,1611,To protect the peace in here, and to cherish our audience's smile.
SK0402,1612,Don't you feel the same, Ogami?
SK0402,1613,Of course I feel the same.
SK0402,1614,So let's do our best together.
SK0402,1615,For my sister... And for everyone.
SK0402,1616,Yes!
SK0402,1617,Well, today I will tell you about the Anti-Kouma Corps.
SK0402,1618,Anti-Kouma Corps of the Army is the predecessor of The Imperial Assault Troop.
SK0402,1619,Ikki Yoneda, Kazuma Shinguji, Shinnosuke Yamazaki, and... Ayame Fujieda.
SK0402,1620,The special force were formed by only those four to defend the capital from Kouma.
SK0402,1621,Seven years ago... A kouma appeared in Nihonbashi.
SK0402,1622,Even though it was just a single kouma, military and police were powerless againts it.
SK0402,1623,However, Anti-Kouma Force sacrified themselves and managed to seal the Kouma.
SK0402,1624,This incident has made the government realized that it's important to prevent evil forces, and took up the problem.
SK0402,1625,Thus, the Imperial Assault Troop, where we belong now, was born.
SK0402,1626,The Imperial Assault Troop is fruit of Anti-Kouma Force's will.
SK0402,1627,And among the Anti-Kouma Force, only Lt. General Yoneda is alive now.
SK0402,1628,Those four who protected people from evil... We have keep carry out their will.
SK0402,1629,...
SK0402,1630,Well, I'll tell you the story about Ayame's travel.
SK0402,1631,In order to recruit members of the Flower Division, Ayame traveled around the world.
SK0402,1632,She searched for girls with high spiritual power, which will suitable to join the Flower Divison,
SK0402,1633,and sent letters to many countries. America, France, China...
SK0402,1634,Whenever she does it, to be honest, I envied her.
SK0402,1635,I see, so she did all that...
SK0402,1636,That's how she gathered the members, and formed Flower Division like now.
SK0402,1637,So, Ogami. These days, I've been thinking like this,
SK0402,1638,Ayame made a right decision when she chose people who would become a part of Flower Divison, including you.
SK0402,1639,Kaede...
SK0402,1640,Ayame has entrusted Flower Division to me, so I'll also continue to give it my all.
SK0402,1641,Don't give yourself in, even when hard time comes, Ogami.
SK0402,1642,Roger! I will do my utmost to meet your expectation!
SK0402,1643,Now I'm going to tell you the story about Ayame and Mayor Yamazaki.
SK0402,1644,Both Ayame and Mayor Yamazaki are members of the Imperial Assault Troupe predecessor, The Anti-Kouma Corps.
SK0402,1645,Mayor Yamazaki was also a notorious scientist who made the basic design of the Spirit Armor.
SK0402,1646,I heard that he also had a strong sense of justice than most people.
SK0402,1647,Ayame and Mayor Yamazaki were in love with each other.
SK0402,1648,But their relation got tore off when The Great Kouma War happened.
SK0402,1649,What could have caused that?
SK0402,1650,This is only a guess, but...
SK0402,1651,it seems that during their fights with kouma, he became obsessed with his own idea.
SK0402,1652,What is "devil?" Why does it exist?
SK0402,1653,And why does it have so much power?
SK0402,1654,Manager Yoneda noticed that Mayor Yamazaki has changed, and he warned him many times,
SK0402,1655,but none of those warnings could change his mind,
SK0402,1656,not even Ayame's words.
SK0402,1657,When the battle with Kouma seven years ago was came to its end, Mayor Yamazaki was missing.
SK0402,1658,In our recent fight, he appeared again, but as The Cerulean Satan.
SK0402,1659,Justice by "power", rule by "devil"...
SK0402,1660,perhaps that was his conclusion...
SK0402,1661,I wonder if Cerulean Satan, or rather, Mayor Yamazaki would tell us his thoughts,
SK0402,1662,back when he appeared in front of the theater six months ago.
SK0402,1663,...
SK0403,1,...
SK0403,2,Demon King... What is it you need of me?
SK0403,3,It seems that the assassination of Ikki Yoneda... was a failure.
SK0403,4,Yes... According to Suiko, Yoneda seems to have regained consciousness.
SK0403,5,However, this, too, falls within my calculations. You need not worry.
SK0403,6,For the time being, Yoneda can't lift a finger against us. Nuhuhuhuh...
SK0403,7,This is our golden opportunity to wipe out both the Assault Troupe and the other interloper in one fell swoop.
SK0403,8,Kazutoyo Yamaguchi, you mean?
SK0403,9,I'll do it!
SK0403,10,Ichiro Ogami... He was pretty good. I'll crush him this time!
SK0403,11,Even though she's just a girl, she was really good with a sword. I wanna fight her again!
SK0403,12,That girl who shot out those weird lights... She'll make for a hell of a fight!!
SK0403,13,That yellow one, zipping around all over the place... I'll take her out in one blow!
SK0403,14,That blue one... He was crazy strong. I wanna fight him for real this time!
SK0403,15,Let's not be hasty, Kongo. The first step in any battle is getting to know your enemy...
SK0403,16,Then taking what you've learned and seizing victory through careful calculation.
SK0403,17,Kongo, you've already fought them once before.
SK0403,18,Perhaps we should leave this one to Kasha, he has yet to cross swords with them.
SK0403,19,I'll fight those pieces of trash, if I truly must...
SK0403,20,I trust you've already arranged a way to get Yamaguchi and the rest of the garbage in one place?
SK0403,21,Indeed, Suiko is already on it. It's all going exactly as planned.
SK0403,22,Suiko? I don't like this one bit. Can that girl really get the job done?
SK0403,23,Don't be like that, Tsuchigumo. No one's better than Suiko when it comes to this sorta thing.
SK0403,24,Well then... I leave it to you, Kasha.
SK0403,25,Heheheh... Behold as my flames consume all...
SK0403,26,...Oh, that time already, huh? Guess I should get started on my night watch.
SK0403,27,It's Kohran's first night back in a long time. I wonder what she's up to?
SK0403,28,Mon Frère! Mon Frèèère!!
SK0403,29,Boss, we have a situation here. You got a minute?
SK0403,30,What is it?
SK0403,31,Kanna, Iris... What's the situation?
SK0403,32,Mon Frère... Sakura and Kohran, they...
SK0403,33,They said they were gonna have a talk with some guy named Kyogoku, then they left.
SK0403,34,Wh-What?!
SK0403,35,Everyone's gathered in the salon, you should head over there too.
SK0403,36,OK, got it!
SK0403,37,But my night watch...
SK0403,38,OK, got it.
SK0403,39,B-But my night watch...
SK0403,40,Who cares about that! Just get your ass over there!
SK0403,41,Now's not the time to be spacing out! Get your ass over there!
SK0403,42,Ow ow ow ow! I'm coming, I'm coming. Please just stop pulling on my ear!
SK0403,43,Ogami, we have quite the problem on our hands.
SK0403,44,I'm sorry! It's all my fault!
SK0403,45,What are you talking about, Saki?
SK0403,46,I heard a rumor earlier today when I was at the Ministry of the Army.
SK0403,47,They said Minister Kyogoku would be hosting a private gathering tonight at a ryotei restaurant in Fukagawa.
SK0403,48,I told Sakura and Kohran about it without thinking...
SK0403,49,And then... They both left.
SK0403,50,(I see. Must be because of what happened earlier today.)
SK0403,51,Seriously, though, talk about reckless!
SK0403,52,Right then, Ogami. What do you think we should do?
SK0403,53,We have to go after them, now!
SK0403,54,Leave them, they'll be fine.
SK0403,55,We have to go after them, now! They could get in big trouble!
SK0403,56,You're right. They're probably both a little worked up.
SK0403,57,All right, now that that's settled, let's go after 'em!
SK0403,58,Not so fast, Kanna. We'll cause a scene if too many of us go.
SK0403,59,Ogami. I have a favor to ask of you. Please bring both of them back.
SK0403,60,We'll be on standby here at the theater. If anything happens, we'll be right there.
SK0403,61,...Understood.
SK0403,62,Keep it together, Ogami!
SK0403,63,Yes, ma'am! OK, I'm off!
SK0403,64,Those two can take care of themselves. We've got nothing to worry about.
SK0403,65,You can't be saying things like that as captain, Ogami.
SK0403,66,What would happen if those two got in some kind of trouble?
SK0403,67,Y-You're right...
SK0403,68,Protecting the Flower Division is your sworn duty, isn't it?
SK0403,69,I'll ask you again, Ogami. Please, bring them back.
SK0403,70,We'll be on standby here at the theater. If anything happens, we'll be right there.
SK0403,71,...Understood.
SK0403,72,Keep it together, Ogami!
SK0403,73,Yes, ma'am! OK, I'm off!
SK0403,74,...
SK0403,75,Ogami, I know you're worried about what to do, but we don't have much time.
SK0403,76,Those two could get caught up in all sorts of trouble.
SK0403,77,Y-You're right...
SK0403,78,It's your duty as captain of the Flower Division to look out for your squad.
SK0403,79,I'll ask you again, Ogami. Please, bring them back.
SK0403,80,We'll be on standby here at the theater. If anything happens, we'll be right there.
SK0403,81,...Understood.
SK0403,82,Keep it together, Ogami!
SK0403,83,Yes, ma'am! OK, I'm off!
SK0403,84,This must be the restaurant Saki was talking about.
SK0403,85,Then... Kyogoku must be here, right?
SK0403,86,The guy who talked smack about your dad.
SK0403,87,Kohran... Maybe I should just do this myself after all.
SK0403,88,I don't want to impose on you.
SK0403,89,C'mon, don't be like that. You don't have to worry about me.
SK0403,90,Besides, I love this kinda stuff!
SK0403,91,Kohran... Thanks.
SK0403,92,Right, now there's just the issue of actually getting to this Kyogoku guy.
SK0403,93,A couple girls like us snooping around will just get thrown out...
SK0403,94,You're right. What should we do?
SK0403,95,...! All right, I got an idea!
SK0403,96,Come with me, Sakura. I've got just the thing!
SK0403,97,You're a genius, Kohran!
SK0403,98,Heheheh... Leave it to me!
SK0403,99,One quick costume change and we're a couple of geisha!
SK0403,100,With these disguises, we can now freely walk around the restaurant!
SK0403,101,Exactly. All right, let's go, Sakura.
SK0403,102,This must be the ryotei that Saki mentioned.
SK0403,103,This place looks pretty fancy... It won't be easy getting in.
SK0403,104,All right, let's go!
SK0403,105,All right, let's go!
SK0403,106,Wh-What should I do...
SK0403,107,All right, let's go! There's no use mulling it over!
SK0403,108,I have to bring them back, and quick!
SK0403,109,Wh-What should I do...? This place looks way too fancy, I'm starting to lose my nerve...
SK0403,110,No, I can't be saying things like that. I'll just go in and see.
SK0403,111,Is this really the place? Doesn't seem like the kind of restaurant the girls could even get into...
SK0403,112,Saki said this was the place, though, so I'll just go in and check.
SK0403,113,How does it look, Kohran?
SK0403,114,I'm not sure, but it sounds like there's a bunch of guys in there talking about something.
SK0403,115,Seems kinda fishy... This might the room that Kyogoku guy's staying in.
SK0403,116,Think we should go for it?
SK0403,117,Yeah. All right, here goes..
SK0403,118,Gooood evening!
SK0403,119,I'm Koyakko!
SK0403,120,A-And I'm Sakurayakko...
SK0403,121,Huh? Who the hell are you?!
SK0403,122,Ah! I-I think we have the wrong room!
SK0403,123,Not only that, b-but these guys look like bad news, too.
SK0403,124,Heheh, what have we here, a couple of geisha! Don't mind him, just bring us some booze!
SK0403,125,What should we do, Kohran?
SK0403,126,...Let's just put up with them for now, then later we can slip out and keep looking for Kyogoku.
SK0403,127,Hey, geisha! Are you comin' or what?!
SK0403,128,Y-Yes, sir. Right away, sir!
SK0403,129,Phew, I've searched just about every room...
SK0403,130,...but I don't see Minister Kyogoku or the girls anywhere.
SK0403,131,All that's left is the room right in front and the room in the back.
SK0403,132,C'mon, geisha girls! Lighten up a little! Guh-huh-huh-huh!
SK0403,133,P-Please stop.
SK0403,134,Huh, that geisha... She sounded kind of like Sakura.
SK0403,135,All right, then... Which room?
SK0403,136,The room in the back with the geisha
SK0403,137,The quiet room right in front
SK0403,138,There's no mistaking it, that voice just now was Sakura's! All right, to the room in the back!
SK0403,139,Oh! You there, sonny. I'm all outta drink! Get me a cold one!
SK0403,140,H-Huh? Sorry, I don't actually work here, sir.
SK0403,141,Actually, sir, if I could ask you a question...
SK0403,142,Do you know which room a man named Kyogoku is staying in?
SK0403,143,Kyogoku? Nawww, I'm Yamaguchi!
SK0403,144,O-OK...?
SK0403,145,Hey now, no need to be so uptight. C'mon, let's share a drink.
SK0403,146,Sorry, but I'm in a hurry... Ah! Wait! Please stopping pulling me...
SK0403,147,All right, time to steel myself and enter this room.
SK0403,148,Excuse me.
SK0403,149,...Whaaa?
SK0403,150,Huh? I-I'm sorry, sir, I have the wrong room! I was looking for a man named Kyogoku!
SK0403,151,Hmmm? Kyogoku? Nawww, I'm Yamaguchi!
SK0403,152,...OK?
SK0403,153,C'mon, sonny, have a seat while you're here.
SK0403,154,Oh, sorry, but I'm in a hurry right now.
SK0403,155,Awww, don't be like that. Just sit down already.
SK0403,156,N-No, really, I'm in a big hurry...
SK0403,157,What, you're too good for this old-timer, is that it?
SK0403,158,N-No, that's not it at all, sir...
SK0403,159,Great! Then let's share a drink first! Bottoms up!
SK0403,160,O-OK...
SK0403,161,(Jeez. Now is NOT the time for this.)
SK0403,162,Hmm, which door...?
SK0403,163,Oh! You there, sonny. I'm all outta drink! Get me a cold one!
SK0403,164,H-Huh? Sorry, I don't actually work here, sir.
SK0403,165,Actually, sir, if I could ask you a question...
SK0403,166,Do you know which room a man named Kyogoku is staying in?
SK0403,167,Kyogoku? Nawww, I'm Yamaguchi!
SK0403,168,O-OK...?
SK0403,169,Hey now, no need to be sho uptight. C'mon, let'sh share a drink.
SK0403,170,Sorry, but I'm in a hurry... Ah! Wait! Please stopping pulling me...
SK0403,171,Eeeeeek!
SK0403,172,N-No! Stop iiiit!!
SK0403,173,Heheheh... Relax, you won't be sayin' "no" for long!
SK0403,174,I got this, Sakura!
SK0403,175,I brought along my Mr. Smoke Bomb for just such an occasion!
SK0403,176,All right, here goes! Brace yourself!
SK0403,177,*cough* *cough* Wh-What the hell was that?!
SK0403,178,Jeez, how long are you going to hold on for?! Let go of me!
SK0403,179,You want some more? Then have some more!
SK0403,180,Thanks, Koyakko, you're a lifesaver.
SK0403,181,Leave it to me, Sakurayakko!
SK0403,182,All right, now let's get outta here and go look for Kyogoku!
SK0403,183,They're sure making a lot of noise next door...
SK0403,184,Here ya go, son. How's about a drink?
SK0403,185,R-Right...
SK0403,186,Say, why the long face?
SK0403,187,How about you tell me your story, son?
SK0403,188,What are ya doin' in a restaurant like this?
SK0403,189,Well, you see...
SK0403,190,I'm looking for a man named Kyogoku.
SK0403,191,I'm looking for my friends.
SK0403,192,I'm looking for a man named Kyogoku.
SK0403,193,I'm looking for my friends.
SK0403,194,I came for a drink.
SK0403,195,I'm looking for the Minister of the Army, a man by the name of Kyogoku.
SK0403,196,Oho, Kyogoku, huh?
SK0403,197,My friends are somewhere in this restaurant.
SK0403,198,I came here to find them.
SK0403,199,I see. Your friends, huh...
SK0403,200,Friends are a priceless treasure. There's nothing more valuable in life.
SK0403,201,I know just how you feel, son. You may be young, but you've earned my respect.
SK0403,202,All right, I like ya. Stay here and drink with me till the sun comes up!
SK0403,203,But I just told you, I'm here to find my friends!
SK0403,204,Uh... I came here for a drink.
SK0403,205,Really? Well why didn't ya say so sooner!
SK0403,206,No need to hold back, drink up! Drink!
SK0403,207,Y-Yes, sir!
SK0403,208,(Should I really be doing this...?)
SK0403,209,I'm sorry, sir, but I'm afraid I can't tell you.
SK0403,210,My, sounds awful important.
SK0403,211,All right then, a few drinks oughta loosen your tongue!
SK0403,212,M-Mr. Yamaguchi!
SK0403,213,...Oh yeah, that reminds me, boy. You were sayin' somethin' about Kyogoku earlier?
SK0403,214,Y-Yes... I'm told Minister Kyogoku booked a private room at this restaurant.
SK0403,215,Well... I haven't heard nothin' 'bout Kyogoku comin' here...
SK0403,216,What?
SK0403,217,FIRE! The restaurant's on fire!!
SK0403,218,FIIIIIRE! Someone's set fires all over the place!
SK0403,219,Huh? Fire?!
SK0403,220,F-Fire?! No, you don't think...?!
SK0403,221,Don't look at me! My "Mr. Smoke Bomb" is totally safe and non-combustible!
SK0403,222,Someone else set fire to this place!
SK0403,223,Fire... Flames...
SK0403,224,Ahhhh!! H-Heeeeelp!!
SK0403,225,Settle down, everyone! Calmly proceed to the exits, and don't rush!
SK0403,226,Kohran, if we don't hurry, the patrons of this ryotei will get hurt!
SK0403,227,It's just like... Back then...
SK0403,228,Kohran?
SK0403,229,Someone set these fires on purpose, to kill people... It's... It's just like before!
SK0403,230,K-Kohran! Where are you going?!
SK0403,231,Sakura, you round everyone up and lead 'em to safety!
SK0403,232,I'm... I'm going after whoever did this!
SK0403,233,Wh-What?! Are you serious, Kohran?!
SK0403,234,I won't let anyone get away with something so cowardly and cruel!
SK0403,235,I'll never let anyone indiscriminately kill innocent people!
SK0403,236,I'm not... I'm not gonna lose to this fire!!
SK0403,237,Kohran, wait! Kohraaan!!
SK0403,238,Dammit! Of all the times for a fire to break out!
SK0403,239,Hrrrm... We've got no choice but to run.
SK0403,240,Evacuate.
SK0403,241,Go find the girls.
SK0403,242,Mr. Yamaguchi, we have to evacuate, now!
SK0403,243,You're right, it's too dangerous in here. Let's go outside.
SK0403,244,I'm going to go help the girls. Please evacuate, Mr. Yamaguchi.
SK0403,245,The girls? I don't know who you're talking about, but for now, let's get out of here. This room's burning, too.
SK0403,246,The girls? You mean those friends of yours you were talking about?
SK0403,247,Hrrrm, I know you're worried, but for now, let's get out of here. This room's starting to catch fire, too.
SK0403,248,Son? Sonny? What are you doing? There's a cloud of cinders coming your way.
SK0403,249,Ow, hot hot hot!!
SK0403,250,It's gotten too dangerous to stick around here. Let's go outside, son.
SK0403,251,Damn! The fire's spreading fast!
SK0403,252,Indeed, this looks to be arson.
SK0403,253,Eeeeek! I-I don't wanna die!
SK0403,254,Stay calm! We're almost at the exit!
SK0403,255,Sakura?!
SK0403,256,Ah!! O-Ogami?!
SK0403,257,Sakura, what's with that outfit?!
SK0403,258,I'll explain later, Ogami! Kohran, she...
SK0403,259,Now that you mention it, I don't see Kohran anywhere. Where is she?
SK0403,260,She's still in there. She said she was going to find the culprit who set the fires.
SK0403,261,Wh-What?!
SK0403,262,What should we do, Ogami?
SK0403,263,I'll go save her!
SK0403,264,Let's both go save her!
SK0403,265,Let's evacuate!
SK0403,266,I'll go save her! Sakura, you take Mr. Yamaguchi here and take him someplace safe!
SK0403,267,I'll go with you!
SK0403,268,Don't be reckless, miss. You're just asking to catch fire with an outfit like that.
SK0403,269,Don't worry, Sakura! I'll save Kohran!
SK0403,270,...OK, understood!
SK0403,271,Be careful, Ogami! Bring Kohran back with you!
SK0403,272,Got it! OK, I'm going!
SK0403,273,OK, Sakura, let's both go help Kohran.
SK0403,274,Now hold on a second, son. Think this through a bit more.
SK0403,275,With the young lady dressed like that, she'd just be asking to catch on fire.
SK0403,276,Besides, I don't think I can make it out of here alone.
SK0403,277,OK then, I'll take this man someplace safe!
SK0403,278,Very good. My name is Yamaguchi, miss. Charmed.
SK0403,279,OK, Sakura, I leave Yamaguchi in your hands!
SK0403,280,Be careful, Ogami! Bring Kohran back with you!
SK0403,281,Got it! OK, I'm going!
SK0403,282,All right, in that case, let's both evacuate!
SK0403,283,Ogami! Now is not the time for jokes!
SK0403,284,What about Kohran? She's still in there!
SK0403,285,You can't go help her dressed like that. This young man's the only one left who can save her.
SK0403,286,Let's both get someplace safe, miss.
SK0403,287,...OK then. Looks like we're out of options.
SK0403,288,Now hurry up, son! Your friend's waiting for you!
SK0403,289,Y-Yes, sir.
SK0403,290,We're counting on you, Ogami!
SK0403,291,G-Got it. OK, I'll be right back!
SK0403,292,What's wrong, son? We don't have time to think things through.
SK0403,293,R-Right... I just don't know what I should do...
SK0403,294,Ogami, please!
SK0403,295,We don't have a choice. All right, son, how about this?
SK0403,296,The young lady can't do anything dressed like that. You'll have to go in there yourself to save your friend.
SK0403,297,Let's both get someplace safe, miss.
SK0403,298,...OK then. Looks like we're out of options.
SK0403,299,Now hurry up, son! Your friend's waiting for you!
SK0403,300,Y-Yes, sir.
SK0403,301,We're counting on you, Ogami!
SK0403,302,G-Got it. OK, I'll be right back!
SK0403,303,Damn, this place is too big!
SK0403,304,I'll have to remember the way I came, or else I won't make it back out.
SK0403,305,The order of doors I opened was... Right, left, front, and left. Gotta remember all that.
SK0403,306,Damn, the flames are even stronger over here...
SK0403,307,Over there! It's Kohran!
SK0403,308,Kohraaan! Kohran, waaait!!
SK0403,309,...Ah, Chief!
SK0403,310,What are you doing, Kohran?! We have to get out of here!
SK0403,311,Chief... Why?!
SK0403,312,They shot Yoneda...
SK0403,313,They burned down my home...
SK0403,314,I can't take it anymore! I'm sick of everyone getting hurt!
SK0403,315,Kohran, calm down!
SK0403,316,LET GO OF ME, OGAMI!!
SK0403,317,I don't want to fight anymore!! I'll just burn to death in this fire!
SK0403,318,Kohran...!
SK0403,319,Slap her on the cheek.
SK0403,320,...!
SK0403,321,...
SK0403,322,Get a hold of yourself, Kohran!
SK0403,323,O... gami...?
SK0403,324,I said let go of me! Stay out of my way!
SK0403,325,(Looks like I don't have a choice. I hate to do this, but...)
SK0403,326,Ah!
SK0403,327,Kohran...
SK0403,328,O... gami...?
SK0403,329,I'm sorry. I did that without thinking... But please, Kohran, you have to understand.
SK0403,330,...
SK0403,331,I should be the one apologizing, Chief.
SK0403,332,It's just... When I saw all this fire, it reminded me of my childhood...
SK0403,333,It's just like that day. Fire as far as the eye could see, the air full of gunshots and screams...
SK0403,334,My mom and dad... They got caught in that fire...
SK0403,335,Kohran...
SK0403,336,The Flower Division's like a family to me, and the Imperial Theater's my home.
SK0403,337,I don't want a bunch of maniacs taking that away from me.
SK0403,338,Kohran, if that's what you truly think, then you need to keep your cool.
SK0403,339,You're not alone, OK?
SK0403,340,You have the Flower Division. I'm right here with you, aren't I?
SK0403,341,You're right. I have the Flower Division... My family.
SK0403,342,Thanks a bunch, Chief. I'll stop being so reckless.
SK0403,343,Good. Now let's get out of here before the whole place burns down.
SK0403,344,...Yeah.
SK0403,345,Chief, do you know the way out?
SK0403,346,If we follow the way I came, we ought to be fine...
SK0403,347,We don't have a lot of time. We'll have to rely on your memory.
SK0403,348,We should be fine if I remember which doors I opened and reverse the order.
SK0403,349,Watch out, though. The doors you opened would be flipped around, too, so left is right and right is left.
SK0403,350,OK, let's go! We've got to escape before the restaurant burns down!
SK0403,351,All right, which door do I open first?
SK0403,352,Open the door on the right.
SK0403,353,Open the door ahead.
SK0403,354,Open the door on the left.
SK0403,355,OK, opening the door on the right!
SK0403,356,All right, that's one room cleared!
SK0403,357,First door down!
SK0403,358,OK, onto the next room!
SK0403,359,Which door should we open next, Chief?
SK0403,360,All right, opening the door straight ahead!
SK0403,361,Hot hot hot! The fire's way too strong in there, we can't go any further!
SK0403,362,OK, if it wasn't the door ahead of us, then...
SK0403,363,OK, opening the door on the left!
SK0403,364,Whoa! The fire's way too strong in there, we can't go any further!
SK0403,365,OK, if it wasn't the door on the left, then...
SK0403,366,Uhh... Which door was it, again?
SK0403,367,Chief, if we don't act quick, we won't make it out in time!
SK0403,368,Even if you don't remember, just try one! Your odds of picking the right one are 1 in 3!
SK0403,369,O-OK then...
SK0403,370,Open the door on the right.
SK0403,371,Open the door ahead.
SK0403,372,Open the door on the left.
SK0403,373,OK, opening the door on the right!
SK0403,374,No good! It's a sea of flames in there!
SK0403,375,Damn, was that not the right door?
SK0403,376,All right, opening the door straight ahead!
SK0403,377,All right! Looks like that was the right door!
SK0403,378,Way to go, Chief! Keep it up!
SK0403,379,OK, let's hurry, Kohran!
SK0403,380,Moment of truth, Chief. Which door do we take?
SK0403,381,The door on the left! Hup!
SK0403,382,Whoa! No good, it's full of fire in there!
SK0403,383,All right, if it wasn't that door, then...
SK0403,384,Uhh... Which door was it, again?
SK0403,385,Chief! If you dawdle around too much, we'll both be burnt to a crisp!
SK0403,386,You're right. OK, it's do or die...
SK0403,387,Open the door on the right.
SK0403,388,Open the door ahead.
SK0403,389,Open the door on the left.
SK0403,390,OK, opening the door on the right!
SK0403,391,Yahoo! Nice going!
SK0403,392,All right! Just a little further till the exit.
SK0403,393,You doing OK, Kohran? I know it's not easy to run in those clothes, but hang in there!
SK0403,394,I'm all right, Chief. Let's get a move on!
SK0403,395,All right, I think this is the last one. If we want to get out of here, we should...
SK0403,396,All right, opening the door straight ahead!
SK0403,397,No good! There's no way we're getting through there!
SK0403,398,Was that not it? Damn, we're running out of time!
SK0403,399,OK, opening the door on the left!
SK0403,400,Hot hot hot! That's a no go!!
SK0403,401,Damn, wrong one!
SK0403,402,Uhh... Which door was it, again?
SK0403,403,There's no time, Chief! You'll just have to guess and go for it!
SK0403,404,Open the door on the right.
SK0403,405,Open the door ahead.
SK0403,406,Open the door on the left.
SK0403,407,OK, opening the door on the right!
SK0403,408,No good, Chief! The flames are too strong to keep going!
SK0403,409,Urgh, dammit!
SK0403,410,All right, opening the door straight ahead!
SK0403,411,Ah! It's full of fire!
SK0403,412,Damn! This isn't it!
SK0403,413,OK, opening the door on the left!
SK0403,414,All right, we did it! We're in the clear!
SK0403,415,Way to go, Chief! That was awesome! You were cool as a cucumber!
SK0403,416,Whew, made it by the skin of our teeth.
SK0403,417,Oh, do I spy some stragglers?
SK0403,418,There's no time! You'll just have to guess and go for it!
SK0403,419,Whoa! There's fire everywhere!
SK0403,420,It's so hot! And these flames! They're not normal, they shouldn't be this strong!
SK0403,421,Kohran, are you OK?!
SK0403,422,Yeah, I'm all right! Don't worry about me. Let's get out of here!
SK0403,423,Still, though, how did the fire get this strong?
SK0403,424,Oh, do I spy some stragglers?
SK0403,425,Who's there?!
SK0403,426,Heheheheh...
SK0403,427,My name... is Kasha. One of the Five Elements of the Black Demon Society.
SK0403,428,The Black Demon Society?! So this fire was your doing!
SK0403,429,Heheheheh...
SK0403,430,Now then, time to incinerate the Imperial Assault Troupe, along with that trash, Yamaguchi.
SK0403,431,Yamaguchi? Why are you after him?!
SK0403,432,Heheheh. "Why" indeed.
SK0403,433,You'll have plenty of time to think about it in hell. Have fun with my flames, won't you?
SK0403,434,Kasha, wait!!
SK0403,435,Th-This is bad, Chief! We're totally surrounded by fire!
SK0403,436,...! There's a gap in the fire!
SK0403,437,We've got no choice, it's do or die. We have to go for it and jump through!
SK0403,438,All right! We escaped!
SK0403,439,Wh-What's that noise?!
SK0403,440,All right! It's the Soaring Whale!
SK0403,441,Ogami, Kohran! Thank goodness you're all right!
SK0403,442,Sakura!
SK0403,443,Thanks a million, Sakura!
SK0403,444,Oh, right! Sakura, where's Yamaguchi?!
SK0403,445,Yamaguchi's evacuating in his car.
SK0403,446,No! Yamaguchi's being targeted by the Black Demons!
SK0403,447,Leaving by car's only going to make him a sitting duck for the Hex Mechs!
SK0403,448,Huh?! Th-Then...
SK0403,449,...I can think of two potential plans.
SK0403,450,One, I could act as a decoy and draw the enemy, during which Yamaguchi can escape.
SK0403,451,There's also the option of escorting Yamaguchi and defeating any hostiles that try to approach.
SK0403,452,All right, then, what should we do?
SK0403,453,Let's go with the decoy plan.
SK0403,454,Let's go with the escort plan.
SK0403,455,Okay, let's go with the decoy plan. That'll give Yamaguchi an opening to escape!
SK0403,456,Okay, let's go with the escort plan. We'll defend him from the Black Demons, no matter what!
SK0403,457,Roger! Let's hop to it, Chief!
SK0403,458,Ogami, Kohran, good luck out there!
SK0403,459,Sorry Ogami, but each customer is only allowed to purchase one photo at a time.
SK0403,460,I see. That's too bad...
SK0403,461,So sorry, Ogami, but each customer is only allowed to purchase one photo at a time.

SK0404,1,Several days after the fire incident in Fukagawa...
SK0404,2,Huh?!
SK0404,3,I-Isn't he...?
SK0404,4,The old man from the restaurant?
SK0404,5,Indeed. I am that old man, Kazutoyo Yamaguchi, the Navy minister.
SK0404,6,M-Minister Yamaguchi... I apologize my disrespect for not realizing that back then!
SK0404,7,I-I'm sorry for calling you "old man."
SK0404,8,Please, I don't mind that. I was also in disguise back then.
SK0404,9,Who would expect that a drunken old man at a ryotei turns out to be Minister of the Navy, eh?
SK0404,10,W-We apologize for troubling you!
SK0404,11,Firstly, the way the Imperial Assault Troupe fights is truly magnificent. 
SK0404,12,The group called the Black Demon Society has been threatening Tokyo with their evil power.
SK0404,13,Additionally, there's been disturbing reports of extremist activity by those in our military.
SK0404,14,I don't want to make any rash moves involving our men.
SK0404,15,However, I promise that the Imperial Assault Troupe will have the navy's full support.
SK0404,16,What's more, I'm a fan of your theater shows. I can't wait to see the Flower Division put on their next performance.
SK0404,17,To ensure that, I'll also pass along some words to my peers in the financial world.
SK0404,18,Does that mean...
SK0404,19,We don't have to worry about being poor anymore?
SK0404,20,I wish you a long life so that you can see Sumire Kanzaki's performance every day.
SK0404,21,Yaaaayy! I love you, Uncle!
SK0404,22,Hahahaha!! I'm happy to hear that. Good luck, young ones!
SK0404,23,R-Roger!
SK0404,24,That's quite a relief, Captain.
SK0404,25,Yeah, all thanks to Sakura and Kohran's reckless behavior.
SK0404,26,Yeowch... That was harsh, Chief.
SK0404,27,Oh, Ogami... You're so mean!
SK0404,28,Tee-hee-hee!
SK0404,29,Ahahahaha...
SK0404,30,Sorry Ogami, but each customer is only allowed to purchase one photo at a time.
SK0404,31,I see. That's too bad...

SK0501,1,Phew... We're pretty much done cleaning the gift shop.
SK0501,2,Thank you very much, Ogami!
SK0501,3,Thank you for your hard work, Ogami. Having you here is a big help to us.
SK0501,4,Now that both the gift shop and our office are done... We can go on vacation without having to worry!
SK0501,5,Right. Summer break's starting tomorrow for them. 
SK0501,6,That means I'll be free from doing odd jobs for a while.
SK0501,7,Heheh. Now we can relax for a while.
SK0501,8,Ogami, u-uhm... I will be away from the theater for a mission.
SK0501,9,In the meantime, there will be a new girl taking care of the shop. Please take care of her.
SK0501,10,Huh? What mission!?
SK0501,11,U-Uh, that's...
SK0501,12,Sorry, Ogami. It's so top-secret that even we haven't been told about it.
SK0501,13,Yep. What's more, even my sources can't figure out what this mission is.
SK0501,14,Tee-hee! Actually, I haven't gotten the details yet.
SK0501,15,I-I see. Now I'm really curious.
SK0501,16,Yo! I'm baaaack!
SK0501,17,Huh? That voice, could it be...
SK0501,18,Yo, Ogami! Kasumi! Yuri! Tsubaki! It's been a while.
SK0501,19,M-Mr. Yoneda!
SK0501,20,Welcome home, sir!
SK0501,21,Are you all healed now?
SK0501,22,Yup, I'm fit as a fiddle now. Sorry to have made you guys worry.
SK0501,23,Yayyy! Now this is great news! I'm gonna tell everyone right away!
SK0501,24,Hahaha, Yuri's acting just like always. There's no place like home, after all!
SK0501,25,Now that I'm home, we're going to celebrate with everyone! Let's go kick things off with a bang!
SK0501,26,(Oh boy... Looks like he's gonna throw a huge bash.)
SK0501,27,To have such a big hospital-leaving party for me... Thanks, you guys.
SK0501,28,Oh... We could have prepared a better party for you if we had more time.
SK0501,29,Yeah... You should have told us sooner.
SK0501,30,She's right, Mr. Yoneda. That's too sudden.
SK0501,31,Hehe, I didn't want to trouble you by making you plan out the whole thing.
SK0501,32,Anyway, you look great in that outfit, Maria.
SK0501,33,Wouldn't you agree, Ogami?
SK0501,34,It suits you very well, Maria.
SK0501,35,You look cool,  Maria.
SK0501,36,You're beautiful, Maria.
SK0501,37,It suits you very well, Maria.
SK0501,38,Is... Is that so? Thank you very much, Captain.
SK0501,39,Wahahaha! That's quite the smooth-talking, Ogami.
SK0501,40,You look pretty cool, Maria.
SK0501,41,Ahaha. Is that so? Thank you very much.
SK0501,42,Hey, Ogami, come on. Maria's a woman, you know?
SK0501,43,I'm sure there are better ways to say that. Jeez, you can be so dense.
SK0501,44,It's fine, Manager. The captain just gave his honest thoughts.
SK0501,45,Hearing him praise me is enough.
SK0501,46,Maria... You're beautiful. It's taking my breath away.
SK0501,47,Ca-Captain! Please, not in front of everyone else...
SK0501,48,That's some kind of way to smooth-talk, Ogami.
SK0501,49,How could Ensign say something so irritating?
SK0501,50,Gahahahaha! Well, fine enough. Now this is the Flower Division that I know.
SK0501,51,I uh... Well... How do I put it into words?
SK0501,52,Mr. Yoneda! Look at the captain, he's all confused after you asked him such an unexpected question. 
SK0501,53,Wahaha! Sorry, Maria. I didn't mean to tease you two that much.
SK0501,54,But I kinda expected that Ogami would have something of the sort.
SK0501,55,R-Right...
SK0501,56,Anyways, you guys helped me a lot by taking care of things while I was gone.
SK0501,57,Let me say it again, I truly thank each and every one of you.
SK0501,58,Mr. Yoneda, it wasn't a big deal. The Flower Division is all about helping each other out, right?
SK0501,59,Yeah. You're one of us, Commander.
SK0501,60,Hehe... Aw, come on. You guys are too kind.
SK0501,61,Well, allow me to reward your hard work after everything that's happened with a gift.
SK0501,62,A gift?
SK0501,63,That's right. Starting tomorrow, you're on summer break.
SK0501,64,Everyone needs to relax once in a while. All of you are going on a trip.
SK0501,65,Huh!? A trip?
SK0501,66,Yep. In fact I've already taken care of your arrangements.
SK0501,67,By tomorrow, you're going to be staying at a resort in Atami. Four days and three nights.
SK0501,68,Even I've heard of Atami! It's a town known all over for their hot springs.
SK0501,69,Go have fun and relax with everyone in the Flower Division, Ogami.
SK0501,70,Thank you, sir!
SK0501,71,Aren't you coming with us, Mr. Yoneda?
SK0501,72,Will the theater be OK?
SK0501,73,Thank you very much! We'll make sure to enjoy ourselves to the fullest!
SK0501,74,Uh-huh.
SK0501,75,Oh right, seems that Saki wants to go, too. Take her with you.
SK0501,76,The manager and I will be staying here, so take it easy.
SK0501,77,But don't forget to bring your Cinematron, Ogami.
SK0501,78,Contact us in case something happens, we'll send the Soaring Whale.
SK0501,79,Roger. In that case, we'll gladly take your offer.
SK0501,80,Aren't you coming with us, you two?
SK0501,81,I need to take care of things I had from before I went to the hospital. Just go on without us.
SK0501,82,Oh right, seems that Saki wants to go, too. Take her with you.
SK0501,83,Every once in a while, you should kick back and not need to worry about us.
SK0501,84,But don't forget to bring your Cinematron, Ogami.
SK0501,85,Contact us in case something happens, we'll send the Soaring Whale.
SK0501,86,Is that so. Then we'll gladly take your offer.
SK0501,87,While we're gone, will the theater be OK? What if the Black Demon Society shows up somewhere?
SK0501,88,Don't worry about it. I've made some arrangements for that.
SK0501,89,The manager and I will be staying here, so take it easy.
SK0501,90,But don't forget to bring your Cinematron, Ogami.
SK0501,91,Contact us in case something happens, we'll send the Soaring Whale.
SK0501,92,Is that so. Then we'll gladly take your offer.
SK0501,93,Uh... What should I...
SK0501,94,No need to worry about the theater, Ogami.
SK0501,95,The manager and I will be staying here, so take it easy.
SK0501,96,But don't forget to bring your Cinematron, Ogami.
SK0501,97,Contact us in case something happens, we'll send the Soaring Whale.
SK0501,98,Is that so. Then we'll gladly take your offer.
SK0501,99,Having summer vacation at a hot spring resort, that doesn't sound bad at all.
SK0501,100,Yes, it sounds fun. Ooh, I'm so excited!
SK0501,101,Yaaay, yaaay!! We're going on a trip! A trip!
SK0501,102,It'll be my first time vacationing in Japan.
SK0501,103,I've never gone to Atami before. I'm so excited!
SK0501,104,A break is necessary at times...
SK0501,105,Alllll right! We're so gonna eat and play to our heart's content!
SK0501,106,What a pleasant present we've received, Captain.
SK0501,107,Yeah. Looks like we're in for a fun summer vacation.
SK0501,108,Now then, today's the day we're finally going to depart for our trip.
SK0501,109,Our meeting point is the entrance hall. We'll depart on 10 o'clock, I guess. I still got 1 hour to spare now.
SK0501,110,I'll check everyone first.
SK0501,111,Ah, morning, Chief.
SK0501,112,Good morning, Kohran. Are you done preparing for the trip?
SK0501,113,Yup, already done. I'm about to go to the hangar for a bit.
SK0501,114,Looks like everyone else is still in their rooms.
SK0501,115,I see. I guess everyone's still packing their things.
SK0501,116,OK, I'm off. See ya later, Chief.
SK0501,117,I should be going, too.
SK0501,118,No one's here yet. Seems that I came too early.
SK0501,119,Everyone will be gathering here at 10 o'clock. I should kill some more time and come back later.
SK0501,120,Oh, it's Reni. Hey!
SK0501,121,Good morning, Reni.
SK0501,122,...Morning.
SK0501,123,Arf, arf!
SK0501,124,Seems that <name> wants to play with you again.
SK0501,125,Now he's even more attached to you than before.
SK0501,126,Arf!
SK0501,127,...
SK0501,128,Reni...
SK0501,129,Have you gotten used to him?
SK0501,130,Let me join.
SK0501,131,Try to pet his head.
SK0501,132,Have you gotten used to him?
SK0501,133,...Used to what?
SK0501,134,To <name>, of course. Weren't you having a hard time dealing with him?
SK0501,135,...Not really. I'm just not that interested.
SK0501,136,Can I play with him, too? Let me join.
SK0501,137,...
SK0501,138,You want to play with us, don't you?
SK0501,139,Arf!
SK0501,140,Reni, look. He just said yes.
SK0501,141,...He was just reacting to a human's voice, not you specifically.
SK0501,142,R-Reni...
SK0501,143,You can pat his head, like this. Come on.
SK0501,144,Wooofff...
SK0501,145,See? Now he's getting happy.
SK0501,146,...
SK0501,147,Arf, arf!
SK0501,148,Try it, Reni.
SK0501,149,...
SK0501,150,...
SK0501,151,Ah, Reni!
SK0501,152,Aw... Reni went away.
SK0501,153,Arf, arf, arf!
SK0501,154,Ah, <name>...
SK0501,155,...
SK0501,156,Hahaha, he's chasing after Reni.
SK0501,157,<name> sure seems to have taken a liking to that kid.
SK0501,158,Wooofff...
SK0501,159,Left you behind, huh?
SK0501,160,Don't worry. It's not your fault.
SK0501,161,Woof.
SK0501,162,Oh, isn't that Kohran right there?
SK0501,163,Heeey, Kohran!
SK0501,164,That voice... Is that you, Chief?
SK0501,165,Man, it's been hot since the sun came up. Summer is really coming, eh?
SK0501,166,I've been picking tomatoes that we've been growin' in this courtyard and I'm already sweating a ton.
SK0501,167,I know, mind if I ask for your help picking these tomatoes?
SK0501,168,Oh, no problem!
SK0501,169,I'm busy right now.
SK0501,170,Oh, no problem! I'd be glad to help.
SK0501,171,Really? Thanks, Chief!
SK0501,172,I'd like to, but I'm busy right now.
SK0501,173,Aw... That's too bad. Can't help it since yer busy.
SK0501,174,I'll see you in the entrance hall, then.
SK0501,175,Hmmm, what should I do?
SK0501,176,You got nothing else to do, right? What do ya say, Chief?
SK0501,177,...OK. I'll help you.
SK0501,178,Thanks, Chief! I knew you were gonna say yes!
SK0501,179,Actually, picking tomatoes aren't the important thing to worry over.
SK0501,180,The important thing to worry about is over there...
SK0501,181,Are those... crows?
SK0501,182,You betcha. They've been flying around tryin' to eat these.
SK0501,183,They've eaten so many of our veggies lately.
SK0501,184,I'm not gonna let them have these tomatoes!
SK0501,185,I need you to drive them away with these smoke bombs I made, Chief.
SK0501,186,B-But... If I throw these, won't it hurt?
SK0501,187,No worries. My smoke bombs will just make them dizzy for a bit, it won't harm them.
SK0501,188,I'm leavin' it up to you! The fate of these tomatoes are in yer hands!
SK0501,189,I managed to pick all the tomatoes safely. Thanks a lot, Chief!
SK0501,190,The crows are doing fine, too. All's well that ends well!
SK0501,191,I managed to pick the tomatoes. Thanks, Chief!
SK0501,192,Some of them got eaten by the crows, but they can't help it.
SK0501,193,They ate most of the tomatoes...
SK0501,194,Sorry, Kohran... If only I could have aimed better.
SK0501,195,Nah, it's fine. You just did your best, Chief.
SK0501,196,They got us this time, but I won't let it happen again!
SK0501,197,Kohran...
SK0501,198,By the way, I didn't even know that you were growing tomatoes over here.
SK0501,199,Hehe, y'know my experiments are usually about machines. I wanted to branch out and do some experiments on vegetables, too.
SK0501,200,If all goes well, I'm sure the vegetables that we've grown will taste a lot more special.
SK0501,201,Haha... Well, I suppose you're right.
SK0501,202,Ah, look at the time! I better get going.
SK0501,203,I'm really grateful for your help. Later, Chief!
SK0501,204,It's very Kohran to use smoke bombs to drive the crows away.
SK0501,205,I better get going.
SK0501,206,Oh, I just finished picking the tomatoes, Chief.
SK0501,207,Some of them got eaten by crows, but I still managed to pick a few.
SK0501,208,I see. That's great.
SK0501,209,Yup. Now I can go on the trip without having to worry.
SK0501,210,Well then, see ya later, Chief.
SK0501,211,Seems that she managed to pick the tomatoes. That's a relief.
SK0501,212,Now maybe I should go somewhere else.
SK0501,213,Arf, arf!
SK0501,214,We're gonna go on a trip for a while, <name>.
SK0501,215,Take care of the theater while we're gone, OK?
SK0501,216,Arf!
SK0501,217,Yo, Boss! C'mere, c'mere!
SK0501,218,Great timing, Boss.
SK0501,219,I'm havin' breakfast right now, how about we have another eatin' contest?
SK0501,220,Oh, nice idea. So, what're we eating?
SK0501,221,It's an Okinawan dish called "Mimiga." It's a pork dish.
SK0501,222,The rules are just like our first contest, the one who finishes the 3-course meal first wins.
SK0501,223,I'm gonna win this time, Kanna!
SK0501,224,Well, let's do this! Ready, aaaand, begin!
SK0501,225,OK, what should I grab first?
SK0501,226,Mimiga
SK0501,227,Rice
SK0501,228,Barley Tea
SK0501,229,This pork... It's kind of weird looking.
SK0501,230,Hehe... That's cause Mimiga is actually made from pig's ears.
SK0501,231,It has a crunchy texture and it tastes great. Try it.
SK0501,232,Munch, munch, crunch... Mm-hm! It does tastes great!
SK0501,233,Oh, and the rice is also perfect. Munch, munch...
SK0501,234,Summer's just begun, so we have a refreshing barley tea.
SK0501,235,Gulp, gulp... OK, I finished the tea!
SK0501,236,Which one I should grab first? I'm not sure...
SK0501,237,What're you doing, Boss? I'm going to beat you to the finish if you don't start chowin' down.
SK0501,238,OK, I finished the first dish. What do you think, Kanna?
SK0501,239,Hey, not bad, Boss. Seems that you've improved since last month, huh?
SK0501,240,All right... Time to get serious.
SK0501,241,I'm not gonna lose! OK, now here comes the second dish!
SK0501,242,Mimiga...
SK0501,243,Rice...
SK0501,244,Barley tea...
SK0501,245,Never thought I would eat pig ears so early in the morning...
SK0501,246,Whew, I managed to finish eating just about everything on the plate!
SK0501,247,Eating two bowls of rice in the morning is quite... tough.
SK0501,248,Munch.... Munch... OK, I managed to finish it.
SK0501,249,Gulp... Gulp...
SK0501,250,Phew, I can slow down a bit thanks to this tea.
SK0501,251,Is it just me or... I can't seem to move my chopsticks anymore.
SK0501,252,What's wrong? You bout to give up, Boss?
SK0501,253,Phew, I finally managed to finish the second dish...
SK0501,254,Way to go, Boss! I can't afford to be careless now!
SK0501,255,OK. Now, time to finish the third batch... I can do this!
SK0501,256,Mi... miga...
SK0501,257,Steamed... rice...
SK0501,258,Barley... tea...
SK0501,259,Mi... miga... Four pieces to go...
SK0501,260,Munch, munch... Three pieces...
SK0501,261,Chomp, chomp... Two pieces...
SK0501,262,Crunch, crunch... One...
SK0501,263,Th-There! I finished all the Mimiga!
SK0501,264,After everything that's happened, I'm starting to get sick just by the sight of rice...
SK0501,265,Anyway... One bowl to go... I'm finishing this.
SK0501,266,Munch... Gobble... Urk...
SK0501,267,All riiight! I finished all of the rice!
SK0501,268,Glug... Glug... Glug!
SK0501,269,Hey, hey, don't just chug it all down in one go!
SK0501,270,Pwaaah! O-OK... I finished drinking the tea!
SK0501,271,Huft... Huft...
SK0501,272,Hey, Boss, you OK?! You can take it easy now.
SK0501,273,I-I'm fine. I'm so gonna win this contest!
SK0501,274,Oh, yeah! I finished the third batch!
SK0501,275,Huhhh!? Y-You already finished it all!?
SK0501,276,Hehe... This was just a regular breakfast to me.
SK0501,277,Whew, that was a great meal. 
SK0501,278,Too bad for you, Boss. That was close, you were just about to finish the third dish.
SK0501,279,You did great, but looks like you still have a long way to go before you can beat me.
SK0501,280,Seems like eatin' three bowls in the mornin' is too much for you.
SK0501,281,I give up... You completely smoked me this time, Kanna.
SK0501,282,Well, now I can go on the trip full of energy!
SK0501,283,K-Kanna, I finished my third plate! How do you like that?
SK0501,284,Aw, too bad. You were almost able to keep up with me!
SK0501,285,See, I'm at my fourth helping now, so I'm a whole plate ahead.
SK0501,286,F-For real? You sure are something, Kanna.
SK0501,287,You're something too, Boss. The fact you're keepin' up with me after just a month is amazing.
SK0501,288,Just like people say, "little and often makes much." You sticking with it is paying off. Hahaha! 
SK0501,289,You can leave the tidyin' to me, Boss.
SK0501,290,I see, thanks. Next time, I won't lose.
SK0501,291,Hehe, you better win! Let's have another eatin' contest next chance we get!
SK0501,292,Sheesh, that was a lot more than I usually eat, even for dinner.
SK0501,293,Now then, it's almost time to meet up in the front. I should get going.
SK0501,294,Kanna's already done putting the dishes away.
SK0501,295,Making sure to follow through with what she started, that's very much Kanna's style.
SK0501,296,No one's here. I guess everyone's already had breakfast.
SK0501,297,I wonder, is Kanna is doing an eating contest today?
SK0501,298,Maybe I should try coming back again some time later.
SK0501,299,There's nothing much I can do in here, I better go to another place.
SK0501,300,I wonder if Mr. Yoneda is in here. 
SK0501,301,It's Ogami. Are you inside?
SK0501,302,...
SK0501,303,Seems like he's not there.
SK0501,304,I better check another room, I guess.
SK0501,305,I wonder if Mr. Yoneda is in here. 
SK0501,306,I better check another room, I guess.
SK0501,307,It's Ogami. Are you inside?
SK0501,308,Oh, Ogami. Yeah, come on in.
SK0501,309,Right. Pardon me.
SK0501,310,Hello, Captain.
SK0501,311,Oh? What're you doing here, Maria?
SK0501,312,I wanted to send my regards to the manager before we left for the trip.
SK0501,313,Commander Yoneda, we're leaving the theater in your care.
SK0501,314,Of course, you can count on it.
SK0501,315,Likewise, please take care of everyone in the Flower Division.
SK0501,316,Yes, you can count on us.
SK0501,317,I'm rarin' to go.
SK0501,318,I'll have Maria with me.
SK0501,319,Of course, you can count on us. I'll make sure to lead everyone in the right direction.
SK0501,320,I leave them in your care then, Captain.
SK0501,321,Well, having you two "chaperones" going along with them makes me not have to worry as much.
SK0501,322,Take it easy and make sure to have fun, you two.
SK0501,323,Yes, sir!
SK0501,324,We're all going to go hog wild when we get there!
SK0501,325,Haha. I like the enthusiasm, but seems Maria's glaring at you now.
SK0501,326,...Captain, please, restrain yourself a bit.
SK0501,327,Ye-Yes! I'll be careful!
SK0501,328,Wahahahaha! At any rate, take it easy and have fun, you two.
SK0501,329,You can relax, Mr. Yoneda. I'll have Maria by my side to keep everyone in check.
SK0501,330,Captain, please...
SK0501,331,Oho, I see you're placing a good deal of trust in her.
SK0501,332,Well, having you two "chaperones" going along with them makes me not have to worry as much.
SK0501,333,Aye.
SK0501,334,Hm? Ogami, were you about to say something?
SK0501,335,Ah... S-Sorry, I just dozed off...
SK0501,336,Hey, hey, are you OK? Don't make a fool out of yourself just because it's hot outside.
SK0501,337,Ogami's always like this... Please take care of everyone, Maria.
SK0501,338,Ah... Y-Yes.
SK0501,339,Captain, please keep yourself together.
SK0501,340,Ye-Yeah... Got it.
SK0501,341,Let's do our best to watch over everyone so we can all relax and have fun together on our trip.
SK0501,342,It's a big responsibility, but we'll pull it off together.
SK0501,343,Yes, it'll be up to us.
SK0501,344,Excuse me, then. I'll see you in the entrance hall at 10 o'clock.
SK0501,345,Having Maria with us is definitely reassuring.
SK0501,346,I need to stay focused so that she can relax and enjoy the trip herself.
SK0501,347,Ah, Mon Frère!
SK0501,348,Yo, Boss! Looking for some snacks to bring along for the ride?
SK0501,349,Oh, I didn't think of that. Are you thinking of bringing some?
SK0501,350,Yeah! I'm gonna bring lots of chocolates and candies!
SK0501,351,I'm gonna bring some heavier food that can fill my stomach, like onigiri.
SK0501,352,If it was you, what would you bring?
SK0501,353,Sweets
SK0501,354,Heavier food
SK0501,355,If it were me, I'd be bringing along sweets.
SK0501,356,Tee-hee! I knew it!
SK0501,357,You should bring lots of candy, too, Kanna!
SK0501,358,All right... That's a good idea.
SK0501,359,OK, do you think 500 packs of chocolate and candy for each person is enough?
SK0501,360,(Do we even have that much in the theater?)
SK0501,361,I guess I'd bring some heavier food along.
SK0501,362,Right? You can't have fun on an empty stomach!
SK0501,363,Think 20 onigiri per person will be enough?
SK0501,364,Nobody other than you can eat 20 rice balls, Kanna!
SK0501,365,O-OK... Then how about 10?
SK0501,366,That still sounds like a full meal and not a snack for the ride...
SK0501,367,I don't need any snacks for myself.
SK0501,368,I mean, I did just eat a giant breakfast with Kanna.
SK0501,369,Ahahahaha! You did, now that you mention it.
SK0501,370,I'll split an onigiri with you when you're starvin', then.
SK0501,371,I'm gonna share half of my chocolates, too!
SK0501,372,Thanks, guys.
SK0501,373,'Kay, Iris. Let's get goin'.
SK0501,374,OK! See you later, Mon Frère!
SK0501,375,Snacks, huh... Now it feels like a picnic.
SK0501,376,OK, I should get going, too.
SK0501,377,We won't have access to the theater's kitchen for the whole trip.
SK0501,378,I wonder, what food they'll be serving at the inn? Oooh, I'm getting excited just thinking about it.
SK0501,379,Hello there, Ogami! Would you like to buy something?
SK0501,380,Buy a photo.
SK0501,381,Talk to Tsubaki.
SK0501,382,Leave.
SK0501,383,Could I buy a photo?
SK0501,384,Sorry, Ogami. I can only sell one photo at a time.
SK0501,385,Please understand, we need to keep some for the customers.
SK0501,386,You'd like to buy a photo? Thank you very much!
SK0501,387,That's a photo of Sakura.
SK0501,388,Let's see... Sakura's photo, right?
SK0501,389,That'll be 50 sen. Thank you very much!
SK0501,390,That's a photo of Sumire.
SK0501,391,Let's see... Sumire's photo, right?
SK0501,392,That'll be 50 sen. Thank you very much!
SK0501,393,That's a photo of Maria.
SK0501,394,Let's see... Maria's photo, right?
SK0501,395,That'll be 50 sen. Thank you very much!
SK0501,396,That's a photo of Kanna.
SK0501,397,Let's see... Kanna's photo, right?
SK0501,398,That'll be 50 sen. Thank you very much!
SK0501,399,That's a photo of Iris.
SK0501,400,Let's see... Iris's photo, right?
SK0501,401,That'll be 50 sen. Thank you very much!
SK0501,402,That's a photo of Kohran.
SK0501,403,Let's see... Kohran's photo, right?
SK0501,404,That'll be 50 sen. Thank you very much!
SK0501,405,That's a photo of Orihime.
SK0501,406,Let's see... Orihime's photo, right?
SK0501,407,That'll be 50 sen. Thank you very much!
SK0501,408,That's a photo of Reni.
SK0501,409,Let's see... Reni's photo, right?
SK0501,410,That'll be 50 sen. Thank you very much!
SK0501,411,Hm, so... you're not going to buy anything?
SK0501,412,We won't be able to see each other for a while, Ogami...
SK0501,413,You'll come back. right?
SK0501,414,...Yes. Please buy my photos when I got back, OK?
SK0501,415,Of course. I'll buy them here for sure.
SK0501,416,Ogami... Thank you very much!
SK0501,417,Please have fun on you summer vacation!
SK0501,418,I'm looking forward to hearing your stories about it!
SK0501,419,Got it, I'll be going now.
SK0501,420,Tsubaki... Come back safely, OK?
SK0501,421,Yes, leave that to me! My brightness is my good point!
SK0501,422,You too. Please make sure you take care of yourself!
SK0501,423,My, you came here like clockwork, Ogami.
SK0501,424,If you're interested in rumors, I'm all out. Sorry.
SK0501,425,I see, that's too bad.
SK0501,426,I'll have some more interesting tidbits to share another time, so look forward to it!
SK0501,427,Hi, Yuri, Kasumi. Are you doing the last bits of cleanup?
SK0501,428,Yes, we just finished sorting the documents.
SK0501,429,Ogami, listen to these rumors I gathered before you go on your trip.
SK0501,430,Or, do you need something right now, Ogami?
SK0501,431,You're gonna listen to my gossip, right, Ogami?
SK0501,432,Listen to the rumor.
SK0501,433,I'll come back later.
SK0501,434,I wonder what kind of secret mission Tsubaki's being assigned to. I'm curious.
SK0501,435,I wonder, too, since neither you or Kasumi know anything about it.
SK0501,436,It must be important for all this secrecy...
SK0501,437,But regardless, I'm sure Tsubaki will be up to the task and come home safely.
SK0501,438,Right, right. It's Tsubaki we're talking about, after all. There's no need to worry about her.
SK0501,439,Ogami, you have got to hear about this. Kasumi, she met a ghost in the storage room!!
SK0501,440,Ugh, don't. I'm getting chills down my spine just from remembering it.
SK0501,441,So... What was the ghost like?
SK0501,442,Well, yesterday, Kasumi went down to the storage room to get some food for the kitchen pantry.
SK0501,443,She heard a voice moan "leave iiiitttt."
SK0501,444,Yuri! I said stop!
SK0501,445,But, Kohran also said she's been hearing weird voices in there. Maybe there really is a ghost...
SK0501,446,How come you two aren't coming along on the trip?
SK0501,447,We still need to do lots of things around the theater, on top of helping out with Tsubaki's transfer papers.
SK0501,448,What's more, I think Tsubaki would feel pretty left out if she knew we were all going on the trip without her.
SK0501,449,I see...
SK0501,450,Do you remember the yakuza boss that got trapped in the fire at the ryotei?
SK0501,451,Huh? Oh, the guy that was in the room that Sakura and Kohran infiltrated by mistake?
SK0501,452,Yes, that one! Seems when he had to evacuate, he got saved by people from that neighborhood.
SK0501,453,Seems that he learned the warmth in the hearts of people helping each other out.
SK0501,454,He turned over a new leaf and is now helping out the community.
SK0501,455,All of his gang members are cleaning up the streets, too.
SK0501,456,Earlier, they cleaned up the street in front of the theater. Deep down, they really are good people.
SK0501,457,Have you read today's edition of Tokyo News?
SK0501,458,No, I haven't, is there an interesting article?
SK0501,459,Steam Office in Turmoil over Measuring System." Right, Kasumi? 
SK0501,460,Yes, precisely.
SK0501,461,Turmoil over Measuring System"? What do you mean by that?
SK0501,462,It seems right now that Japan is using several different systems of measurement at the same time. 
SK0501,463,The main ones right now are traditional Japanese, Metric, and English Imperial Units...
SK0501,464,All the plumbing pipes were measured in different systems, so now all the officials are confused!
SK0501,465,I see, that must be hard on them.
SK0501,466,Ah, yes, did you know about this, Ogami?
SK0501,467,I heard the resort inn you're staying at on this trip is owned by friends of the manager.
SK0501,468,Is that so.
SK0501,469,Looks like he organized all the accommodations so that the Flower Division can relax.
SK0501,470,He said since it's his friend's resort, you can relax just like it was your own home.
SK0501,471,It's just like him to think of all that for us.
SK0501,472,By the way, I heard that Gakushuin Girls' School will start commoners as students starting this spring.
SK0501,473,If I recall, Sumire graduated from there.
SK0501,474,Huh? So up until now, Gakushuin didn't allow common folk in?
SK0501,475,Yes. There used to be a rule that the school would only accept girls from noble families.
SK0501,476,But it seems that this rule has been erased. That's a good thing, I think.
SK0501,477,But, the entrance exam still costs you 5 yen. Guess it's still a school for the rich.
SK0501,478,It's not easy to get in? Hmph, that's boring.
SK0501,479,When it comes to summer, Koshien field is all people think about, right, Yuri?
SK0501,480,You mean the high school baseball tournament that's been on the radio lately? I wonder which school will win.
SK0501,481,Oh, if I recall, its venue moved to "Koshien" last year.
SK0501,482,Yes. It's said to be the largest baseball stadium in all of Asia.
SK0501,483,That said, doesn't this tournament makes you want to support a team from your hometown?
SK0501,484,Hahaha, I do, now that you mention it. I wonder if there's a team from there this year.
SK0501,485,Sorry, Ogami, but I'm all out of gossip for now.
SK0501,486,I'll have some more interesting tidbits to share another time, so look forward to it!
SK0501,487,I'll come again. Please take care of the theater while we go on the trip.
SK0501,488,OK. Make sure to relax and enjoy yourself, Ogami.
SK0501,489,I'm looking forward to hearing more juicy stories.
SK0501,490,Tell me all of them when you get back, OK?
SK0501,491,...From there... The sea... After that, I...
SK0501,492,That voice. Is that you, Saki?
SK0501,493,M-My... Ogami?
SK0501,494,What are you doing in this place?
SK0501,495,I could say the same, Saki. I heard your voice coming from here...
SK0501,496,Tee-hee, I couldn't stop getting excited for our trip to the hot springs.
SK0501,497,I was just thinking of all the things I could do when we arrive. Must have started talking out loud.
SK0501,498,Uh-huh...
SK0501,499,I just love hot springs, so I asked for special permission to come along.
SK0501,500,Bathing in the warm water makes me more beautiful.
SK0501,501,What do you hope to get when we enter the hot spring, Ogami?
SK0501,502,To reenergize my soul.
SK0501,503,To have a strong drink.
SK0501,504,To rest my bones.
SK0501,505,I want to reenergize my soul.
SK0501,506,Oh, hmmhmm. Being so earnest as usual, Ogami.
SK0501,507,It makes me want to see you in a shared bath...
SK0501,508,Having a good drink, I guess. I'm sure the best spot for it is in an outdoor bath.
SK0501,509,My, that sounds lovely!
SK0501,510,Shall I pour some for you when the time comes?
SK0501,511,My body's been feeling real stiff these days. I just want to sit down and relax.
SK0501,512,Oh... That's too bad.
SK0501,513,I know, I'll give you a gentle massage after you're done bathing.
SK0501,514,I haven't put much thought into it, guess I'll just take a bath like I normally would.
SK0501,515,Hehe, not a bad idea.
SK0501,516,Shall I scrub your back for you there?
SK0501,517,...What?! R-Really?
SK0501,518,Hmm-hmm, look forward to it when we get there.
SK0501,519,I'll see you later. I can't wait for the trip.
SK0501,520,S-Saki... Was she being serious with that?
SK0501,521,I feel like this trip will definitely be something.
SK0501,522,The scent of Saki's perfume is still lingering around a bit.
SK0501,523,There's no point in dawdling around here. Let's head to another room.
SK0501,524,Nobody's here...
SK0501,525,Well, since we're leaving soon, we don't need this room much.
SK0501,526,The theater is on break, so we're leaving these costumes lying out in this room for a while.
SK0501,527,We might not even use this room until the autumn performance next month.
SK0501,528,Seems that we won't be using the music room while we're on summer break.
SK0501,529,Though once we get back, everyone will get right back into rehearsing.
SK0501,530,No one's on stage since there's no rehearsals.
SK0501,531,I should just go to another room.
SK0501,532,We're holding our autumn performance next month...
SK0501,533,I'm sure everyone will give amazing performances after recharging on this trip.
SK0501,534,The theater is closed for summer break, so the doors are shut.
SK0501,535,Now that I think about it, I wonder who's going to do night patrols while I'm away...
SK0501,536,I hope this place will be filled with guests during the autumn performance next month.
SK0501,537,Well, judging from our last performance, it should be fine.
SK0501,538,The theater's on break for the summer, so there's no customers.
SK0501,539,OK, I better go to another room now.
SK0501,540,I wonder if Sakura is inside.
SK0501,541,It's just like Sakura to have a cute nameplate like this.
SK0501,542,OK, let's check another room.
SK0501,543,Yeees? Who is it?
SK0501,544,It's Ogami. May I come in, Sakura?
SK0501,545,Ah, it's you, Ogami. The door's unlocked, come in.
SK0501,546,OK, sorry to intrude.
SK0501,547,Good morning, Ogami.
SK0501,548,Morning. Are you done with your preparations for the trip?
SK0501,549,Yes. I was thinking of bring some medicine just in case.
SK0501,550,Oh right, while I'm preparing for the trip, there's something I wanted to ask you.
SK0501,551,Between the colors red, blue, and yellow, which one do you like the most?
SK0501,552,Red
SK0501,553,Blue
SK0501,554,Yellow
SK0501,555,Uh... Red, I guess.
SK0501,556,Red it is. Thanks.
SK0501,557,Uh... Blue, I guess.
SK0501,558,Blue it is. Thanks.
SK0501,559,Uh... Yellow, I guess.
SK0501,560,Yellow it is. Thanks.
SK0501,561,Uh... I don't have any favorite color in particular.
SK0501,562,Is that so... That's a problem.
SK0501,563,I know, since you were in the Navy, how does blue sounds?
SK0501,564,Huh? Oh... It's fine, I guess.
SK0501,565,Why do you ask?
SK0501,566,Uh... That's...
SK0501,567,I-It's nothing. Don't worry about it.
SK0501,568,You telling me that only makes me more curious now.
SK0501,569,A-Anyway... I'm excited to go on this trip with everyone else.
SK0501,570,What are you looking forward to?
SK0501,571,Playing together with everyone.
SK0501,572,Having a feast at the resort.
SK0501,573,Seeing you in a swimsuit.
SK0501,574,Having fun and playing together with everyone, of course. That's what I'm looking forward to.
SK0501,575,I agree! I'm very excited for that, too.
SK0501,576,Going to the beach, having dinner together... I'm sure it'll be exciting.
SK0501,577,If we're talking about the trip, it's definitely having a feast at the resort. I can't wait for it.
SK0501,578,I agree. It's one of the things I'm most looking forward to on the trip.
SK0501,579,That would be... Seeing you in a swimsuit, of course.
SK0501,580,...O-Ogami!
SK0501,581,Ah... Sorry, sorry. I didn't mean to tease you.
SK0501,582,Please stop joking around, you'll get me all embarrassed.
SK0501,583,Uh... There's so much I'm looking forward to. It's hard to choose  one.
SK0501,584,Hehe, now that you mention it, you're right.
SK0501,585,Anyway, I hope we can enjoy this trip without getting hurt.
SK0501,586,Yeah, you're right.
SK0501,587,OK, I still want to pack some more things, so excuse me.
SK0501,588,Yeah, got it. See you later, then.
SK0501,589,I wonder if Sakura is inside.
SK0501,590,It's just like Sakura to have a cute nameplate like this.
SK0501,591,OK, let's check another room.
SK0501,592,...She's not here.
SK0501,593,I wonder if Sumire is inside.
SK0501,594,This is a pretty subtle design, considering it's Sumire.
SK0501,595,Let's check another room.
SK0501,596,Yeees? Who is it?
SK0501,597,It's Ogami.
SK0501,598,My, please come inside, Ensign.
SK0501,599,OK, sorry to intrude.
SK0501,600,Morning, Sumire. Are you done preparing for the trip?
SK0501,601,I need just a little more time. As you can see, there's still a lot of things I'd like to bring.
SK0501,602,Spare clothes, makeup, swimsuit, toiletries, my diary, my tea seat just in case.
SK0501,603,Books to read when I'm bored and my special pillow. There's still many things to pack along.
SK0501,604,...Special pillow?
SK0501,605,Yes. I wouldn't be able to sleep without it.
SK0501,606,When I was at my family's house, I went to the effort of having this pillow sent there for me.
SK0501,607,Are you fine sleeping without your usual pillow, Ensign?
SK0501,608,I'm OK without it.
SK0501,609,No, I need it, too.
SK0501,610,I don't use pillows.
SK0501,611,I'm fine without it. I can sleep wherever and whenever.
SK0501,612,My, that's impressive. It must be the training from when you were in the Navy.
SK0501,613,Hahaha, that's a lot of praise for just a small little thing.
SK0501,614,Nah, I need it, too. I can't relax unless it's my usual pillow.
SK0501,615,My, is that so? It's surprised to see the delicate side of you.
SK0501,616,In that case, shouldn't you be bringing your pillow, too?
SK0501,617,Hahaha, it's not that big of a deal to me, though. I'll manage.
SK0501,618,I do have a pillow in my bed, but I don't use it that much.
SK0501,619,My... How can you sleep like that?
SK0501,620,Uh... I guess it's easier for me to fall asleep than most people.
SK0501,621,I'm astonished to learn there are people out there who can sleep without something as basic as a pillow.
SK0501,622,...I hadn't given it much thought until now.
SK0501,623,Well, we do spend a third of our life sleeping, Ensign.
SK0501,624,It's only natural for people to pursue the most comfortable sleep possible.
SK0501,625,I-I see...
SK0501,626,Well then, since I still have more things to prepare...
SK0501,627,I must apologize that we'll have to suspend our tea brewing class, Ensign. 
SK0501,628,OK, no problem. I'm be going, then. See you later, Sumire.
SK0501,629,I wonder if Sumire is inside.
SK0501,630,This is a pretty subtle design, considering it's Sumire.
SK0501,631,Let's check another room.
SK0501,632,It's Ogami...
SK0501,633,I'm sorry, Ensign, but preparations are taking longer than I expected.
SK0501,634,I see, sorry for interrupting.
SK0501,635,I wonder if Sumire is inside.
SK0501,636,This is a pretty subtle design, considering it's Sumire.
SK0501,637,Let's check another room.
SK0501,638,There's no answer. Looks like she's not here.
SK0501,639,I wonder if Maria is inside.
SK0501,640,It's Maria's nameplate.
SK0501,641,OK, I'll check another room.
SK0501,642,It's Ogami. Are you there, Maria?
SK0501,643,Oh, Captain, it's you. The door's unlocked, please come in.
SK0501,644,OK. Excuse me.
SK0501,645,Good morning, Captain.
SK0501,646,Morning, Maria. Are you done preparing for the trip?
SK0501,647,Yes. I finished packing last night.
SK0501,648,I see... Just as I thought you would, Maria.
SK0501,649,Now that I think about, I don't visit your room too often.
SK0501,650,True. As you can see, there's noth much to show you.
SK0501,651,(Maria was sleeping on this bed...)
SK0501,652,(I wonder what she wears for sleep.)
SK0501,653,(Pajamas, yukata, she could wear all kinds of stuff.)
SK0501,654,Ask her.
SK0501,655,What kind of outfit do you wear to bed, Maria?
SK0501,656,Huh!? Uh, it's nothing...
SK0501,657,Nothing"?
SK0501,658,It's... Is it really that important to you?
SK0501,659,Huh? What's wrong with the question?
SK0501,660,Everything!
SK0501,661,Oh... S-Sorry. Guess that was pretty unecessary.
SK0501,662,...
SK0501,663,What are you continuing to stare at?
SK0501,664,Er, nothing...
SK0501,665,Captain, it's not polite to stare at a woman's bed.
SK0501,666,(Right, it is impolite to stare so intensely.)
SK0501,667,(The desk has a simple yet functional design. Just like its owner)
SK0501,668,I always use that desk; it's my favorite.
SK0501,669,(That chair has the same design as her desk. Does she always go for simplistic designs?)
SK0501,670,That chair looks just like your desk. I guess you prefer simpler designs, Maria.
SK0501,671,Yes, I tend to gravitate towards things that are easy to determine at first glance.
SK0501,672,What kind of book are you reading?
SK0501,673,Ah, this isn't a book. It's my diary.
SK0501,674,Do you keep one, Captain?
SK0501,675,Yeah, pretty much.
SK0501,676,No, I don't.
SK0501,677,I can't stick to any routine for very long.
SK0501,678,I keep one too, although I don't write in it much.
SK0501,679,I see, so you keep one, too.
SK0501,680,You can always learn something new re-reading how you acted previously.
SK0501,681,No, I don't.
SK0501,682,Is that so? Keeping one is rather fun.
SK0501,683,You can always learn something new re-reading how you acted previously.
SK0501,684,I wanted to try, but I always stop doing it early on.
SK0501,685,Try to make a habit of writing in it at certain times, like before bed or after dinner.
SK0501,686,Even writing a few lines for the day is fine. What matters is you're doing it consistently.
SK0501,687,I see... I'll keep that in mind. Thanks.
SK0501,688,Oh, I'm sorry about you on such a private matter, Captain.
SK0501,689,Oh, it's fine. I don't mind at all.
SK0501,690,Oooh, a diary, hmm?
SK0501,691,C-Captain!! What do you think you're doing?!
SK0501,692,Well... I just want to take a look inside...
SK0501,693,Captain, please! Don't just flip through a person's diary without permission!
SK0501,694,Oh... Sorry.
SK0501,695,*sigh*... You surprise me at times.
SK0501,696,(Aw, I wanted to see what was in Maria's diary.)
SK0501,697,It's felt nice around here since this morning, hasn't it?
SK0501,698,Yeah. Seems that we'll have a fine weather.
SK0501,699,Seeing a mirror like this reminds me that I'm in a woman's room.
SK0501,700,Heh, is that so?
SK0501,701,(There's a group photo of everyone from the theater.)
SK0501,702,Now then, I'll be taking my leave.
SK0501,703,Yes. I'm finished packing myself and was about to go as well.
SK0501,704,How about we get going, Captain?
SK0501,705,We should be finished with our business here. Let's go, Captain.
SK0501,706,If I remember correctly, we should be gathering at the entrance hall at 10 o'clock.
SK0501,707,Yeah. What are you gonna do until then?
SK0501,708,Ah, actually, I was just going to write in my diary.
SK0501,709,I suddenly remembered a game I once tried. I was going to play a bit before we depart.
SK0501,710,Well then, Captain. Please excuse me. 
SK0501,711,A game that she... once tried? I wonder what it is.
SK0501,712,Well then, Captain. Please excuse me. 
SK0501,713,OK, I should get going now.
SK0501,714,I wonder if Maria is inside.
SK0501,715,It's Maria's nameplate.
SK0501,716,OK, I'll check another room.
SK0501,717,Looks like Maria's not here.
SK0501,718,I wonder if Kanna is inside.
SK0501,719,Kanna's... Well, I guess it's more of a nametag than a nameplate.
SK0501,720,OK, let's check another room.
SK0501,721,Look's like Kanna's not here.
SK0501,722,I wonder if Kanna is inside.
SK0501,723,Kanna's... Well, I guess it's more of a nametag than a nameplate.
SK0501,724,OK, let's check another room.
SK0501,725,U... Uh...
SK0501,726,Who's... there? It's still... early in the morning...
SK0501,727,Hey, Kanna, are you still sleeping?
SK0501,728,Oh, it's you...
SK0501,729,The door's unlocked, you can come in.
SK0501,730,OK, then. Excuse me...
SK0501,731,Fwaaaah... Mornin', Boss.
SK0501,732,...Aah! It's already this late?
SK0501,733,Kanna... You were sleeping like that?
SK0501,734,Uh... Last night, I was exercisin' in here. Must've went straight to bed right after that.
SK0501,735,Aw man, now you caught me when I'm all messed up...
SK0501,736,Jeez, you're so sloppy!
SK0501,737,Come on, you're a girl...
SK0501,738,It can happen sometimes.
SK0501,739,Jeez, you're so sloppy! Get a hold of yourself!
SK0501,740,Sorry... I'll be more careful.
SK0501,741,I'll do better next time, so let me off easy, OK?
SK0501,742,...Just be careful, OK?
SK0501,743,You're a girl, so you need to take better care of yourself.
SK0501,744,Sorry, Boss. I'll be more careful next time.
SK0501,745,You're a girl." Hehe... Now I'm blushin'.
SK0501,746,Well, when you get tired, it happens sometimes.
SK0501,747,...Yeah, right! So it happens to you, too, eh?
SK0501,748,It's just not a good habit, so I'll be careful next time.
SK0501,749,Uh, Boss... Are you mad?
SK0501,750,Nope. I wasn't saying anything, but I didn't mean it that way.
SK0501,751,Can ya give me a pass this time? I'll be more careful.
SK0501,752,I need to change clothes, ASAP.
SK0501,753,Make sure to not be late, Kanna. See you.
SK0501,754,Yeah, thanks! See ya later, then.
SK0501,755,Kanna, are you done yet?
SK0501,756,Oh, Boss. I'm still changin'.
SK0501,757,Thanks for waitin'. Now I'm ready for the trip.
SK0501,758,Are you done packing?
SK0501,759,Hehe, the secret of traveling is that you bring just the bare necessities.
SK0501,760,I'm pretty used to travellin' all over, so I can pack my things pretty quick.
SK0501,761,Hahaha, OK.
SK0501,762,OK, now I wanna have some breakfast.
SK0501,763,You should come, too. Let's have an eatin' contest again.
SK0501,764,I'll see you later. Bye, Boss. 
SK0501,765,Hi, Sumire. How's it coming along?
SK0501,766,Well, see... I'm having a spot of trouble.
SK0501,767,I was going to bring a book to read if I get bored during the trip...
SK0501,768,But I'm not sure which one to bring along.
SK0501,769,Hahaha... Is that so.
SK0501,770,If you were in my position, what would you bring along to accompany you?
SK0501,771,A novel.
SK0501,772,A book related to my job.
SK0501,773,A schedule book.
SK0501,774,If I were bringing one, I'd take a novel I can really sink my teeth into, you know?
SK0501,775,I see... That sounds like a good idea.
SK0501,776,Well, if I were bringing one, I'd probably bring a book related to my job like something on military strategy or history.
SK0501,777,*huff* Bringing your work along on vacation is quite the foul idea, Ensign.
SK0501,778,It would bring down everyone's mood. They all want to have fun on this trip.
SK0501,779,I-I see... You have a point.
SK0501,780,Since we're going on a trip, we should bring a schedule book along, right?
SK0501,781,Oh my... That's quite the joke, Ensign.
SK0501,782,Your sense of wit is as sharp as ever.
SK0501,783,Uh... If it were me, I wouldn't bother bringing a book along.
SK0501,784,I just want to forget about my daily life and enjoy what the resort has to offer to the fullest.
SK0501,785,I see... You do have a point.
SK0501,786,Thank you, Ensign. You were most helpful.
SK0501,787,We're going to gather at the entrance at 10 o'clock, so I will see you later.
SK0501,788,OK, I should get going too right now.
SK0501,789,Uh... No one's here.
SK0501,790,I guess everyone's busy preparing stuff for the trip.
SK0501,791,Oh, Mon Frère! Good morning!
SK0501,792,I'm going to bring some cards along on the trip!
SK0501,793,I have to get going! See you later, Mon Frère!
SK0501,794,Iris is especially cheerful this morning.
SK0501,795,Well, I'm sure everyone's excited for the trip.
SK0501,796,Now, I should head to another room.
SK0501,797,Oh, if it isn't Maria.
SK0501,798,Oh, Captain.
SK0501,799,During my trip to America, I learned how to play billiards and I wanted to brush up on my skills before we left.
SK0501,800,I see, so this is the "game you once tried" that you were talking about.
SK0501,801,Yes. Would you like to try it?
SK0501,802,Would you like to try?
SK0501,803,OK, let's play!
SK0501,804,I don't know the rules...
SK0501,805,OK, let's play! I've been wanting to play with this pool table for quite awhile
SK0501,806,Haha. Well then, let's play a quick game of nine-ball.
SK0501,807,It'll be a nice way to kill some time before we depart.
SK0501,808,OK... Shall we play, then?
SK0501,809,I don't really know how to play billiards...
SK0501,810,In that case, I'll teach you while we play.
SK0501,811,Since we still have some time before we depart, let's play a quick game of nine-ball.
SK0501,812,The rules are simple. You hit the cue ball with your cue stick...
SK0501,813,...and then have it hit the ball labeled with the lowest number into a pocket, those holes in the table.
SK0501,814,The winner is the one who sinks the ball labeled number 9 into the pocket.
SK0501,815,I see... Doesn't seem as hard as I thought it would be.
SK0501,816,Well then, let's play right away.
SK0501,817,Hmm, what to do...
SK0501,818,I think it'll be a nice way to spend some time before we have to leave.
SK0501,819,Playing a round of nine-ball won't take us much time.
SK0501,820,Well, let's play, then.
SK0501,821,Sure. Let's play a quick game of nine-ball.
SK0501,822,Now it's your turn, Captain. This is your chance to drop the 9 ball.
SK0501,823,For this one, you need to use a bit more power and strike the ball as hard as possible.
SK0501,824,Hit.
SK0501,825,Hit it hard.
SK0501,826,OK... Here I go!
SK0501,827,Aw... I guess that was too soft.
SK0501,828,You should hit it a bit harder, Captain.
SK0501,829,You might have sunk the 9 ball had you done that.
SK0501,830,I missed it, huh.
SK0501,831,OK, now it's my turn.
SK0501,832,W-What the?! The ball hopped!
SK0501,833,That was a jump shot.
SK0501,834,It's a technique used to leap over an obstructing ball to hit the target behind it.
SK0501,835,Wow... You're as awesome as always, Maria.
SK0501,836,Heheh, you can learn it too if you practice.
SK0501,837,More power... and shoot!
SK0501,838,Yeah! The 9 ball didn't go in, but I was able to sink number 8!
SK0501,839,Good job, Captain. Your form in your arms was good, too.
SK0501,840,Thanks for your advice, Maria.
SK0501,841,OK, now it's my turn.
SK0501,842,W-What the?! The ball hopped!
SK0501,843,That was a jump shot.
SK0501,844,It's a technique used to leap over an obstructing ball to hit the target behind it.
SK0501,845,Wow... You're as awesome as always, Maria.
SK0501,846,Heheh, you can learn it too if you practice.
SK0501,847,Oh... Oh no. I was so nervous, I couldn't shoot it.
SK0501,848,No need to be so nervous. Try to shoot without too much thought.
SK0501,849,It's just a game, so it's all right if you had fun.
SK0501,850,Y-You're right, Maria. Thanks.
SK0501,851,For example, you can shoot like this.
SK0501,852,W-What the?! The ball hopped!
SK0501,853,That was a jump shot.
SK0501,854,It's a technique used to leap over an obstructing ball to hit the target behind it.
SK0501,855,Wow... You're as awesome as always, Maria.
SK0501,856,Ahah. Usually I don't make shots like that.
SK0501,857,You should try to play for fun, without any fear of failure.
SK0501,858,Yeah, got it. Thanks, Maria.
SK0501,859,I ended up losing to you, but I had fun anyways.
SK0501,860,If you don't let your mind open up, you won't be able to have any fun.
SK0501,861,I think this summer trip will be a good way for everyone to recuperate.
SK0501,862,Yeah...
SK0501,863,Now then, it's time for me to leave, Captain.
SK0501,864,If you'd like, perhaps we can play billiards again.
SK0501,865,Of course. I'll beat you next time, Maria.
SK0501,866,I'm looking forward to it. Please come again to this game room later on.
SK0501,867,I'll have to ask Maria to teach me billiards again later on.
SK0501,868,I'm sure that I can win against her someday.
SK0501,869,No one's in here, huh.
SK0501,870,I wonder if everyone is busy preparing things for the trip...
SK0501,871,Iris... Is she inside?
SK0501,872,So Iris's nameplate is shaped like Jean-Paul...
SK0501,873,I better check another room, I guess.
SK0501,874,It's Ogami. Are you there, Iris?
SK0501,875,Huh, Mon frere? Yaay! Welcome!
SK0501,876,It's unlocked, come on in.
SK0501,877,OK, then. Excuse me...
SK0501,878,Are you done packing, Iris?
SK0501,879,Yeah. I started yesterday and I'm almost done...
SK0501,880,But I still have to finish my math homework and I don't know how to solve it...
SK0501,881,What should I do, Mon Frère?
SK0501,882,I'll help you.
SK0501,883,How about you do it later, after the trip?
SK0501,884,I'll help you.
SK0501,885,Really? Yaay! You're really kind, Mon Frère!
SK0501,886,OK then, please teach me.
SK0501,887,Hahaha. OK, you can count on me.
SK0501,888,How about you do it later, after the trip?
SK0501,889,But won't I end up just thinking about the homework the whole trip?
SK0501,890,I want to finish it before I go on a fun vacation like that.
SK0501,891,Uh...
SK0501,892,I know! Why don't you help me study like before, Mon Frère!
SK0501,893,Huh? Me?
SK0501,894,It's a deal! Please teach me, Mon Frère!
SK0501,895,Oh, boy... OK, then.
SK0501,896,I see... Now that's a problem.
SK0501,897,I know! Why don't you help me study like before, Mon Frère!
SK0501,898,Huh? Me?
SK0501,899,Please help me so I can have fun on the trip! Please?
SK0501,900,Oh, boy... OK, then.
SK0501,901,I don’t really get these times tables…
SK0501,902,I see, that makes sense. We have our own system for times tables in Japan.
SK0501,903,I imagine it must be tough for you to learn, since you were born in France.
SK0501,904,Well, I think I remember some of them.
SK0501,905,35, 15... <br> 36, 18... <br> 37... <br> Uh, what was it again?
SK0501,906,It's 21.
SK0501,907,It's 24.
SK0501,908,It's 27.
SK0501,909,37, 21. <br> 3 times 7 equals 21.
SK0501,910,You’re right! That was awesome, Mon Frère!
SK0501,911,37, 24. <br> 3 times 7 equals 24.
SK0501,912,OK... Huh? That’s not right, Mon Frère.
SK0501,913,The answer sheet says “37, 21.” 3 times 7 equals 21. You got it all wrong!
SK0501,914,H-Huh? Sorry, my bad.
SK0501,915,37, 7. <br> 3 times 7 equals 27.
SK0501,916,OK... Huh? That’s not right, Mon Frère.
SK0501,917,The answer sheet says “37, 21.” 3 times 7 equals 21. You got it all wrong!
SK0501,918,H-Huh? Sorry, my bad.
SK0501,919,Huh? My mind went blank after you asked so suddenly.
SK0501,920,Hmm... Oh, there's an answer written here, it's 21.
SK0501,921,Oh, that's right! 3 times 7 equals 21!
SK0501,922,You should have answered sooner. That's not cool, Mon Frère!
SK0501,923,Mon Frère, how should I memorize times tables?
SK0501,924,Please give me some tips.
SK0501,925,Ways to memorize times tables, huh? Hm...
SK0501,926,Use marbles.
SK0501,927,Use repetition.
SK0501,928,Write them on paper and pin it to wall.
SK0501,929,Iris, do you have any marbles?
SK0501,930,Yeah. Here you go.
SK0501,931,Let's create groups of three marbles. If we have 6 in each group, there's 18 marbles. 7 makes it 21.
SK0501,932,So each time you add one to each group, it means you add three more marbles. 
SK0501,933,It's hard if you just memorize the answer, so it'll be easier to understand by imagining this, right?
SK0501,934,You're right! 15, 18, 21, 24... Each of them adds three marbles!
SK0501,935,Thanks a lot, Mon Frère! I got it right away!
SK0501,936,The only way is to memorize them by saying the times table out loud repeatedly.
SK0501,937,35, 15... <br> 36, 18... <br> 37, 21..
SK0501,938,By continuing to say it out loud, you'll be able to recite it from memory.
SK0501,939,Oh, so it's like memorizing the script for our plays. I'll try it!
SK0501,940,The only way is to look at it constantly to memorize the answers.
SK0501,941,Write them on paper and put it on something that you always see. You'll remember them before you know it.
SK0501,942,Oooh! You're so smart, Mon Frère!
SK0501,943,I'll put this on my door so I can memorize them!
SK0501,944,Huh... What is the best way to memorize them?
SK0501,945,I guess it's just like Kaede said...
SK0501,946,...the only way is to say them out loud a lot.
SK0501,947,Thanks a ton, Mon Frère! I got to finish my homework before our trip!
SK0501,948,Your times tables are very important, Iris. You'll forget them if you don't keep practicing.
SK0501,949,It'll be fine! I already memorized it!
SK0501,950,Come on, let's go outside!
SK0501,951,OK, let's go.
SK0501,952,OK, let's go.
SK0501,953,Make sure you review it later.
SK0501,954,OK, let's go. I want to check up on everyone else, too.
SK0501,955,Yay! OK, let's go, Mon Frère. Quick!
SK0501,956,Just so we're clear, you have to keep practicing them, OK?
SK0501,957,O-OK, got it. I'll do that once we get back from our trip.
SK0501,958,C'mon, Mon Frère, we have to hurry, it'll be time to go soon!
SK0501,959,He-Hey, hey... Don't go so fast, Iris!
SK0501,960,Thanks a lot for helping me, Mon Frère!
SK0501,961,OK, I'm gonna go now. Bye-bye!
SK0501,962,Hahaha. She ended up running off fast as a bullet. Looks like she's in quite a good mood.
SK0501,963,Alrighty, let's check up on everyone else.
SK0501,964,Iris... Is she inside?
SK0501,965,So Iris's nameplate is shaped like Jean-Paul...
SK0501,966,I better check another room, I guess.
SK0501,967,There's no response. Looks like she's already went out.
SK0501,968,I wonder if Orihime is inside.
SK0501,969,The name plate has a simple design, but it sure looks classy.
SK0501,970,Let's go check another room.
SK0501,971,Orihime, are you there?
SK0501,972,U... Uh...
SK0501,973,Mmm... Zzz... Zzz...
SK0501,974,Is she still sleeping?
SK0501,975,Shout to wake her up.
SK0501,976,Open the door by force.
SK0501,977,Leave her.
SK0501,978,Heeey, it's almost 10 o'clock, Orihime!
SK0501,979,Mmmm... Uh... So annoying...
SK0501,980,You're going to be left behind if you oversleep!
SK0501,981,...Late? The trip...?
SK0501,982,Huh?! It's... It’s already this late?!
SK0501,983,Hey, now... You're gonna be late if you don't hurry.
SK0501,984,Ensign, you saved me. Just this once, thank you.
SK0501,985,Never mind that, just change your clothes, quick!
SK0501,986,(Oh boy. That would have been terrible if I hadn't woken her up.)
SK0501,987,(I have to force my way into her room!)
SK0501,988,Uh...? 
SK0501,989,...Wa! W-Who's there!?
SK0501,990,Oh, you're finally awake. It's me, Ogami.
SK0501,991,E-Ensign?! Do you intend to become a criminal at last?!
SK0501,992,Don't break into peoples' rooms!!
SK0501,993,N-No! The clock! Look at the time!
SK0501,994,Huh?! It's... It’s already this late?!
SK0501,995,You would've overslept if I hadn't done that.
SK0501,996,But... But even so, there must be better ways to wake me up than that!
SK0501,997,I need to change, so get out!
SK0501,998,Oh dear... This'll be quite the ruckus just before the trip.
SK0501,999,She'll just get angry at me if I wake her up, so let's leave her be.
SK0501,1000,Let sleeping dogs lie... I'll just head to another room.
SK0501,1001,Uh... Should I or should I not wake her up?
SK0501,1002,Well, she'll eventually wake up on her own, so let's just leave for now.
SK0501,1003,I wonder if Orihime is inside.
SK0501,1004,The name plate has a simple design, but it sure looks classy.
SK0501,1005,Let's go check another room.
SK0501,1006,Orihime, are you awake?
SK0501,1007,Y-Yes... I also somehow managed to get changed.
SK0501,1008,Thanks... Sorry for taking up your time.
SK0501,1009,Don't slack off!
SK0501,1010,Be more careful next time.
SK0501,1011,Did something happen?
SK0501,1012,Don't slack off and oversleep, Orihime!
SK0501,1013,I-It's not like I overslept on purpose!
SK0501,1014,You made in time, but be more careful next time.
SK0501,1015,It's vexing to hear that warning... But this time, I suppose you're right.
SK0501,1016,This doesn't seem like you. Did something happen?
SK0501,1017,Hearing your concern for me is humiliating, but I suppose there's no helping things.
SK0501,1018,...
SK0501,1019,Never once did I ever think you'd have to wake me up, Ensign.
SK0501,1020,I hate Japanese men...
SK0501,1021,As much as I hate... waking up early.
SK0501,1022,Having a type of person I hate making me do something that I hate...
SK0501,1023,But I might have missed the trip otherwise...
SK0501,1024,Should I be happy or angry... I don't know anymore.
SK0501,1025,W-Well the important thing is that you're not going to be late.
SK0501,1026,I still have some things to prepare, so I need to go.
SK0501,1027,Boy, looks like she was able to make it on time.
SK0501,1028,There's no time left! I'm heading out first!
SK0501,1029,Boy, looks like she was able to make it on time.
SK0501,1030,I wonder if Orihime is inside.
SK0501,1031,The name plate has a simple design, but it sure looks classy.
SK0501,1032,Let's go check another room.
SK0501,1033,It's Ogami...
SK0501,1034,I'm still getting ready! Don't talk to me!
SK0501,1035,(She'll just get angry if I keep asking. I better leave her alone.)
SK0501,1036,I wonder if Orihime is inside.
SK0501,1037,The name plate has a simple design, but it sure looks classy.
SK0501,1038,Let's go check another room.
SK0501,1039,Looks like she's already gone on to the entrance to meet up with everyone.
SK0501,1040,There's not much time. I should get going too.
SK0501,1041,This is Kaede's room.
SK0501,1042,I better check another room, I guess.
SK0501,1043,It's Ogami. Are you there, Kaede?
SK0501,1044,Oh, Ogami. The door's unlocked, come in.
SK0501,1045,Right. Pardon me.
SK0501,1046,Hi, Ogami. Did you need something?
SK0501,1047,Have a chat.
SK0501,1048,Ask about Ayame.
SK0501,1049,Nothing in particular.
SK0501,1050,It's very sunny outside. At this rate, it'll be hot again by afternoon.
SK0501,1051,That's true, it is the height of summer after all.
SK0501,1052,That reminds me, Kohran said that at 9:30 she was going to pick tomatoes in the courtyard.
SK0501,1053,Everyone else seems busy packing for the trip.
SK0501,1054,Perhaps they're still inside their own rooms.
SK0501,1055,I see...
SK0501,1056,Make sure to bring your Cinematron along, Ogami.
SK0501,1057,Y-Yes, ma'am!
SK0501,1058,I would like to hear your story, Kaede... If that's OK with you.
SK0501,1059,Why of course. Hmm... What should I talk about?
SK0501,1060,No... Nothing in particular.
SK0501,1061,I just wanted to see you.
SK0501,1062,Oh, is that so? I'm happy to hear that, Ogami.
SK0501,1063,Well then, I have to excuse myself.
SK0501,1064,You're always welcome here.
SK0501,1065,All right. Well, I should get going. Please excuse me.
SK0501,1066,I'm glad I could talk with Kaede. I'll visit her again next time.
SK0501,1067,This is Kaede's room.
SK0501,1068,I better check another room, I guess.
SK0501,1069,It's Ogami. Are you there, Kaede?
SK0501,1070,Oh, Ogami.
SK0501,1071,I'm sorry, but I have to write these reports.
SK0501,1072,I see. Then I'll see you later.
SK0501,1073,Sorry, Ogami. Let's have a nice talk some other time.
SK0501,1074,Phew... Being in my own room is quite relaxing.
SK0501,1075,Now, what should I do...
SK0501,1076,Call someone.
SK0501,1077,Grab Cinematron.
SK0501,1078,Get back to work.
SK0501,1079,Call someone.
SK0501,1080,Get back to work.
SK0501,1081,I know, why don't I make a call?
SK0501,1082,Oh, right. I need to bring my Cinematron along.
SK0501,1083,...There. Now I can contact the theater in case something goes wrong.
SK0501,1084,Let's do this later. I still have other stuff to do.
SK0501,1085,I wonder if Reni's inside.
SK0501,1086,It seems that Reni is not here.
SK0501,1087,It's just a piece of paper from a notebook. I suppose that's fitting for someone like Reni.
SK0501,1088,OK, let's check another room.
SK0501,1089,I wonder if Kohran is inside.
SK0501,1090,There's no response. Looks like she's in another room.
SK0501,1091,A gear-shaped nameplate, huh? It's just Kohran's style.
SK0501,1092,Let's check another room.
SK0501,1093,Nobody's here. I wonder if everyone's busy preparing for the trip.
SK0501,1094,Guess tea lessons with Sumire are postponed for now.
SK0501,1095,Perhaps I should visit her room, just in case.
SK0501,1096,Maybe everyone's still their rooms.
SK0501,1097,Nobody's here...
SK0501,1098,Guess I better check another room.
SK0501,1099,We'll be having our autumn performance next month.
SK0501,1100,I hope these seats will be full of guests like our last play.
SK0501,1101,The theater's on summer break, so no one's here.
SK0501,1102,Let's check another room.
SK0501,1103,Another sunny day.
SK0501,1104,I hope the weather will stay like this when we reach Atami.
SK0501,1105,No one's here.
SK0501,1106,There's not much time left. Let's check another room.
SK0501,1107,Everyone's getting ready for the trip, so no one would be coming here.
SK0501,1108,Well, let's check another room.
SK0501,1109,Nobody's here.
SK0501,1110,Ah, Ogami.
SK0501,1111,Sakura, are you hurt or something?
SK0501,1112,No, I was just thinking that we should bring some medicine along for the trip.
SK0501,1113,Do you need me to bring anything along?
SK0501,1114,Anti-motion sickness pills.
SK0501,1115,Disinfectant.
SK0501,1116,Anti-motion sickness pills.
SK0501,1117,Disinfectant.
SK0501,1118,Love potion.
SK0501,1119,I think bringing some anti-motion sickness pills for our trip to Atami would be good.
SK0501,1120,OK. I'll bring some of those.
SK0501,1121,It's weird to hear you say that seeing as you're always piloting a Koubu.
SK0501,1122,People may get injured at the beach, so it'd be nice to have some disinfectant.
SK0501,1123,I agree. I'll bring the first aid kit, then.
SK0501,1124,Let's see... How about a love potion? 
SK0501,1125,Huh? L-Love potion?
SK0501,1126,Hahaha, just kidding.
SK0501,1127,Oh... That was a surprise.
SK0501,1128,...
SK0501,1129,But, Ogami... Hypothetically, if the potion did existed, who would you use it on?
SK0501,1130,...Huh?
SK0501,1131,N-No! It's nothing!
SK0501,1132,Uh... I don't really need anything.
SK0501,1133,Are you sure? In any case, I'll bring some aspirin.
SK0501,1134,There. Medicine's all ready.
SK0501,1135,I'm going to leave, Ogami. See you later.
SK0501,1136,Yeah. See you later.
SK0501,1137,OK, I should get going, too.
SK0501,1138,Looks like nobody's here, just the smell of disinfectant.
SK0501,1139,I should check another room. I wonder if everyone's finished preparing for the trip.
SK0501,1140,Oh! Mornin', Chief.
SK0501,1141,Morning, Kohran. You been working on our Koubu this morning?
SK0501,1142,Hiya, Chief.
SK0501,1143,Hi, Kohran. Are you doing maintenance on our Koubu?
SK0501,1144,Yeah. Since we're gonna leave the theater for our trip...
SK0501,1145,I wanted to make some adjustments so they'll be ready to deploy in an instant.
SK0501,1146,Keep up the good work.
SK0501,1147,Aren't you overthinking things?
SK0501,1148,That outfit looks cool.
SK0501,1149,Keep up the good work, Kohran. You're the one who understands them the most.
SK0501,1150,Thanks, Chief. Hearing that from you lifts my spirits.
SK0501,1151,Leave these Koubu to me. I'll make sure they can move out in a jiffy if we need 'em to.
SK0501,1152,Kohran, aren't you overthinking things?
SK0501,1153,We're on a summer break, how about you try relaxing for a bit?
SK0501,1154,Ya got it wrong, Chief. War knows no rest.
SK0501,1155,And it's precisely because of breaks like this that need to keep checking up on them.
SK0501,1156,I-I see...
SK0501,1157,Kohran, you look good in that outfit.
SK0501,1158,Wha-What're ya sayin' all out of the blue? That's come out of nowhere.
SK0501,1159,These are just work clothes. It's nothing compared to the gorgeous outfits everyone else wears.
SK0501,1160,That's what I meant. You're good just the way your are. I think you look really nice in that outfit.
SK0501,1161,R-Really? Thank, Chief...
SK0501,1162,C-Chief, say something, now I'm getting embarrassed.
SK0501,1163,Uh... Oh, right. I was lost in thought.
SK0501,1164,Ahahaha... You're really a carefree person, Chief.
SK0501,1165,Chief, have you ever learned the story of how people got the idea to make Koubu?
SK0501,1166,The story? No, I can't say I have.
SK0501,1167,This is a tale dating all the way back to the American Civil War 60 years ago. 
SK0501,1168,The Confederate Army of the south was using black magic during their campaign against the north.
SK0501,1169,The Union army had no means of defending against their sorcery. People were being wiped out in droves.
SK0501,1170,But after one devastating battle, a single survivor was found!
SK0501,1171,A lone baby, hidden inside a tractor.
SK0501,1172,It was found that the tractor was made with a cheap metal alloy of iron and lead.
SK0501,1173,That alloy, it turned out, had the power to defend against their dark powers. They named it Celesteel.
SK0501,1174,Celesteel...
SK0501,1175,The reason our Koubu can fight demons is because they're made from Celesteel.
SK0501,1176,Even the basement of the theater is made using the stuff.
SK0501,1177,I see... So that's how it came to be.
SK0501,1178,As for Celesteel, think my story was good enough to "sell" you on it? Ahahahaha!
SK0501,1179,That was hilarious!
SK0501,1180,Huh... What do you mean?
SK0501,1181,That was hilarious!
SK0501,1182,F-For real?! I kinda forced it, though.
SK0501,1183,No need to pretend it was funny. I don't like seeing someone lie.
SK0501,1184,You just need to retort it when it bores you.
SK0501,1185,No... I really thought it was funny.
SK0501,1186,But, I'll keep in mind about doing retorts.
SK0501,1187,Huh... What do you mean?
SK0501,1188,I was trying to throw a pun about Celesteel. Doesn't work, huh?
SK0501,1189,Uh...
SK0501,1190,Chief, you should just play along, you need to go "say what?!" to lame jokes.
SK0501,1191,It'd be awkward for me if no one retorts it.
SK0501,1192,I see... I'll keep that in mind.
SK0501,1193,I'll make sure to humor you again. No biggie.
SK0501,1194,Ah, dear me... Didn't work, huh?
SK0501,1195,Ah, s-sorry. I was quite dumbfounded right there.
SK0501,1196,It wasn't funny after all. No need to force your laugh, but at least retort, would ya?
SK0501,1197,It'd be awkward for me if no one retorts it.
SK0501,1198,I see... I'll keep that in mind.
SK0501,1199,OK now, I have to do one more thing before the trip.
SK0501,1200,One more thing?
SK0501,1201,Today I'm gonna pick some tomatoes that I planted in the courtyard.
SK0501,1202,I'm going to start at 9:30, so why don't you come over and take a look? Later, then.
SK0501,1203,Picking tomatoes, huh... Sounds fun.
SK0501,1204,I'll have to swing by the courtyard at 9:30.
SK0501,1205,Kohran's not here. I she went off to do something.
SK0501,1206,Anyway, no one's here, so I'll just check another room.
SK0501,1207,Looks like no one's around, only the Koubu and Eisenkleid.
SK0501,1208,Oh well, guess I should go to another room.
SK0501,1209,Huh? Looks like someone's in the bathroom.
SK0501,1210,These clothes... These are Kohran's.
SK0501,1211,T-That means... Kohran's in the bath...
SK0501,1212,My body is moving towards the bathroom on its own...
SK0501,1213,Go back outside.
SK0501,1214,Oh no... My body is moving towards the bathroom on its own...
SK0501,1215,(Kohran...)
SK0501,1216,(She must have taken off her glasses, so maybe she won't notice me...)
SK0501,1217,...!
SK0501,1218,U-Uh oh!
SK0501,1219,Remain calm.
SK0501,1220,Run away.
SK0501,1221,Remain calm.
SK0501,1222,I'm sure she won't notice me since she took off her glasses...
SK0501,1223,Ch-Chief!?
SK0501,1224,Eh!? Your glasses... Are you wearing them!?
SK0501,1225,Get outta here, Chief! Just get out, quick!
SK0501,1226,S-Sorry! I'm getting out!
SK0501,1227,...
SK0501,1228,My apologies, Kohran. It was an accident.
SK0501,1229,Unlike the showers, this bathroom is huge, so I have to wear my glasses.
SK0501,1230,Now I realize I made a wise choice.
SK0501,1231,Sorry. I'll be more careful.
SK0501,1232,Well, since you apologized so earnestly, I'll forgive you this one time.
SK0501,1233,Do that again and I'll never let you forget it.
SK0501,1234,Phew... Somehow I got away without getting yelled at.
SK0501,1235,Huh. So now she take baths with her glasses on.
SK0501,1236,(I gotta get out of here before she sees me!)
SK0501,1237,Phew... I think I got away before she realized it was me.
SK0501,1238,Had I'd been just a moment slower, I might not have made it. That was too close...
SK0501,1239,Ah... Uhm... I...
SK0501,1240,Ch-Chief!?
SK0501,1241,Eh!? Your glasses... are you wearing them!?
SK0501,1242,Get outta here, Chief! Just get out, quick!
SK0501,1243,S-Sorry! I'm getting out!
SK0501,1244,...
SK0501,1245,My apologies, Kohran. It was an accident.
SK0501,1246,Unlike the showers, this bathroom is huge, so I have to wear my glasses.
SK0501,1247,Now I realize I made a wise choice.
SK0501,1248,Sorry. I'll be more careful.
SK0501,1249,Well, since you apologized so earnestly, I'll forgive you this one time.
SK0501,1250,Do that again and I'll never let you forget it.
SK0501,1251,Phew... Somehow I got away without getting yelled at.
SK0501,1252,Huh. So now she take baths with her glasses on.
SK0501,1253,She must be cleaning herself up after working on the Koubu so much.
SK0501,1254,I better not bother her and walk away.
SK0501,1255,OK. Looks like she didn't notice.
SK0501,1256,Now, let's go to another room.
SK0501,1257,Phew, washing up after a long maintenance session sure hits the spot.
SK0501,1258,Well, time to finish.
SK0501,1259,(Ack! Her glasses... She's still wearing them!)
SK0501,1260,(I gotta get out of here before she sees me!)
SK0501,1261,Phew... I think I got away before she realized it was me.
SK0501,1262,Had I'd been just a moment slower, I might not have made it. That was too close...
SK0501,1263,Hiya, Chief.
SK0501,1264,H-Hey, Kohran. Uh... Are you finished with your bath?
SK0501,1265,Yup. Having a bath after doing maintenance sure feels great.
SK0501,1266,I cleaned up and changed my clothes. Now I'm ready to get back to it.
SK0501,1267,I'm gonna pick some tomatoes. See ya, Chief.
SK0501,1268,Relaxing in a bath after finishing a task sure is the best.
SK0501,1269,Let's not doze off. I should head to the next room.
SK0501,1270,Looks like no one's taking a bath right now.
SK0501,1271,Well, we'll have a hot spring in Atami, anyway.
SK0501,1272,...Captain.
SK0501,1273,Oh, it's you, Reni. What are you doing here?
SK0501,1274,I'm researching the geography of our destination in Atami.
SK0501,1275,Our enemies may strike while we're there.
SK0501,1276,Way to go.
SK0501,1277,Impressive, but rest comes first.
SK0501,1278,Aren't you overthinking things?
SK0501,1279,Thinking of combat even as we're going on vacation. Good idea, Reni.
SK0501,1280,...Is that so? It's just the natural thing to do.
SK0501,1281,I'm happy you're not neglecting that stuff, but rest is more important.
SK0501,1282,Our summer break just started, taking the time to recuperate is important, too. 
SK0501,1283,...Right. I know.
SK0501,1284,Reni, aren't you overthinking things?
SK0501,1285,After all, we're going on vacation. Forget about combat and take a rest.
SK0501,1286,...Battle doesn't go on vacation.
SK0501,1287,Uh...
SK0501,1288,...
SK0501,1289,The resort is located near both the ocean and mountains.
SK0501,1290,Our enemies might not attack during our vacation, but we cannot afford to let our guard down.
SK0501,1291,Reni, you're being as cautious as always.
SK0501,1292,Just because we're on summer break, doesn't mean we can let our guard down.
SK0501,1293,I hope we won't have to use this room during our break.
SK0501,1294,There's no use in worrying about it. Let's just enjoy the trip as much as we can.
SK0501,1295,Wha... What's that sound?!
SK0501,1296,...!? Looks like it came from behind this wall.
SK0501,1297,And it seems that... It stopped when I got here.
SK0501,1298,Check the wall.
SK0501,1299,Pretend to leave.
SK0501,1300,Leave.
SK0501,1301,I'm gonna check the wall.
SK0501,1302,...
SK0501,1303,...
SK0501,1304,Uh... Doesn't seem to be anything out of place.
SK0501,1305,(OK... I'll pretend to leave.)
SK0501,1306,That's weird, I thought I heard something. Was it my imagination?
SK0501,1307,Can't do anything about that, better check out another room.
SK0501,1308,...
SK0501,1309,(Just as I thought...)
SK0501,1310,Who's there!?
SK0501,1311,Ugh... What's happening here?
SK0501,1312,Hmm... Maybe there's construction going on, I don't know...
SK0501,1313,I'm curious, but I don't have time to find out... Let's check another room.
SK0501,1314,...The sound is gone.
SK0501,1315,Hmm... Was it just my imagination?
SK0501,1316,No one seems to working out before the trip.
SK0501,1317,Guess no one's here. Let's head to another room.
SK0501,1318,Now that it's midsummer, maybe there's a chance I'll go swimming in the pool.
SK0501,1319,I can swim to my heart's content during the trip.
SK0501,1320,No one's here.
SK0501,1321,No one's swimming here. We're all going to swimm at the beach, after all.
SK0501,1322,Smells like nice soap in here. Maybe it's because Kohran just took a bath.
SK0501,1323,There's no use in standing idly by here. Let's move to another room.
SK0501,1324,We're gonna have a bath in Atami, so there's no need to take a one right now.
SK0501,1325,Let's just head to another room.
SK0501,1326,The heat from the steam processor makes this room hotter than the others.
SK0501,1327,Ugh, I'm starting to sweat. What am I doing in this place anyway?
SK0501,1328,...Ah!! 10 o'clock snuck up on me!
SK0501,1329,I'm gonna get left behind if I don't hurry to the entrance!
SK0501,1330,Hey, everyone. Thanks for waiting.
SK0501,1331,Oh, you're right on time. I'm sure everyone will be here soon.
SK0501,1332,Oh, sorry for the wait, Boss, Kaede!
SK0501,1333,Man, I was rushing to get here, too. Glad I made in time.
SK0501,1334,Sakura and Orihime are also here.
SK0501,1335,All members present here, Kaede.
SK0501,1336,Thank you.
SK0501,1337,I-I'm sorry, came a bit late.
SK0501,1338,It's not good to be tardy, Ogami.
SK0501,1339,You're making me worry about how the trip will go.
SK0501,1340,Yes, I apologize...
SK0501,1341,Here, your Cinematron. You mustn't forget it.
SK0501,1342,Ah! I-I'm truly sorry!!
SK0501,1343,Anyway, isn't Atami quite far away?
SK0501,1344,How do we get there? Don't tell me we're going in the Soaring Whale?
SK0501,1345,Ahahaha! We'd get there in the blink of an eye if we flew in that.
SK0501,1346,But then the higher-ups would give me an earful for that!
SK0501,1347,Then how do we get to Atami?
SK0501,1348,Let's go outside. I got a ride ready for you.
SK0501,1349,Wooow! What a big car!
SK0501,1350,This a steam bus. I reserved it exclusively for your trip.
SK0501,1351,Hooo boy. A private bus, sounds fancy.
SK0501,1352,Well done, Mr. Yoneda. What a grand idea.
SK0501,1353,Gwahahahaha! I told you I'd take care of everything.
SK0501,1354,OK, everyone. Have fun!
SK0501,1355,Please watch over everyone, Ogami.
SK0501,1356,We'll be off!
SK0501,1357,Are you sure the theater will be fine?
SK0501,1358,Yes, we'll be off! Please take care of the theater in our stead!
SK0501,1359,Yes, you can count on us.
SK0501,1360,But... Are you sure the theater will be safe?
SK0501,1361,Are you sure the theater will be safe?
SK0501,1362,...
SK0501,1363,Are you worried about the theater, Ogami?
SK0501,1364,Y-Yeah... I'd be lying if I said I wasn't.
SK0501,1365,Bah, no need to worry.
SK0501,1366,You see, we already got ourselves a bunch of powerful helpers.
SK0501,1367,Huh? Helpers?
SK0501,1368,Hey boys, come on out and show yourselves!
SK0501,1369,Imperial Assault Troupe, Rose Division, reporting for duty!
SK0501,1370,R-Rose Division!?
SK0501,1371,Wh-Who are these people...?
SK0501,1372,These men are the Rose Division. They'll be watching over the theater while you're all away.
SK0501,1373,Pleased to meet you, Ensign Ogami. I'm Seiryuin Kotone...
SK0501,1374,Captain of the Rose Division, a secret unit all for beauty and love.
SK0501,1375,Ichirooo! I've always wanted to meet you! Let me give you a kiss!
SK0501,1376,U-Uwaaahh! Please don't!
SK0501,1377,Hey now, Yokihiko! You need to introduce yourself first.
SK0501,1378,Oh, dear me. Sorry, forgive me for that.
SK0501,1379,I'm Yokihiko Ota, also of the Rose Division.
SK0501,1380,Now, Kiku. You haven't said hello yet, right?
SK0501,1381,Yes! A-Ah, uhm... Hello... Ogami...
SK0501,1382,I'm... Kikunojo Oka, n-nice to meet you.
SK0501,1383,Heh. So, how does it feel to meet the esteemed Ensign Ogami, Kikunojo? 
SK0501,1384,S-Stop, Kotone. It's... Uhm... He's nice...
SK0501,1385,What's with this group of weirdos?
SK0501,1386,Now, now. Despite their appearances, these guys are some of the Imperial Army's finest.
SK0501,1387,Hey, aren't you going to say hello, Ogami?
SK0501,1388,Oh... U-Uhm...
SK0501,1389,H-Hello...
SK0501,1390,I'm Ichiro Ogami.
SK0501,1391,H-Hello...
SK0501,1392,You guys are fabulous.
SK0501,1393,H-Hello... Nice to meet you...
SK0501,1394,Myyy, aren't you nervous right there, Ichiro? Ooh-ho, how cuuute!
SK0501,1395,Oh... What a shy person, I can't help but love that.
SK0501,1396,Nice to... meet you too...
SK0501,1397,I'm Ichiro Ogami. Nice to meet you, everyone.
SK0501,1398,Ah, lovely! How gallant! Oh, I'm yours to command!!
SK0501,1399,That's the refined manner and kindness one should expect from a naval ensign. Even men would fall for that.
SK0501,1400,You're so cool, Ogami.
SK0501,1401,Well, aren't you all fabulous. I'm surprised.
SK0501,1402,Smooth words, Ichiro! Let me kiss you!
SK0501,1403,N-No thanks!
SK0501,1404,Oh, you called us "fabulous." I'm so happy to hear that. I could cry...
SK0501,1405,Ah, you sure have a sense for beauty. Just what we expect from the captain of the Flower Division.
SK0501,1406,...
SK0501,1407,Aha! Seems that you're so mesmerized by my looks that you've become speechless.
SK0501,1408,Please, Mr. Kotone! Don't be so full of yourself.
SK0501,1409,He must be mesmerized by my physical beauty and stature!
SK0501,1410,W-Wait up! I...
SK0501,1411,Oho, you're blushing! So innocent, Ichiro. How cute!
SK0501,1412,Apparently he's been captivated by each of our beauty.
SK0501,1413,Is... Is that so?! I'm... so happy.
SK0501,1414,S-Sorry, Mr. Yoneda, I need to ask you something, just to make sure...
SK0501,1415,Ahh, yes. Despite what first impressions may lead you to believe, these fellows are all men.
SK0501,1416,Huuuh? But why are they acting so ladylike?!
SK0501,1417,Iris, there are all kinds of people in this world.
SK0501,1418,Ohoho, there are many like them in the courts of Europe.
SK0501,1419,But, to leave the theater in their care...
SK0501,1420,Will it really be OK?
SK0501,1421,Whaaat? Don't worry. As I said, they may not look it, but these men are some of the army's finest soldiers.
SK0501,1422,Affirmative. We shall protect the theater and General Yoneda.
SK0501,1423,So please, enjoy your vacation!
SK0501,1424,P-Please... Have a safe trip...
SK0501,1425,Fareweeeell!
SK0501,1426,(Uh... Instead of taking it easy, why am I getting more worried?) 
SK0501,1427,Sorry, Ogami, but each customer is only allowed to purchase one photo at a time.
SK0501,1428,I see. That's too bad...
SK0501,1429,My apologies, Ogami, but each customer is only allowed to purchase one photo at a time.
SK0501,1430,Oh, really? That's too bad...

SK0501,1496,Ayame and I almost never lived in the same household, even though we were sisters.
SK0501,1497,Eh...?
SK0501,1498,It’s not so unusual, given our lineage. We have less a "family tree" and more a "family wisteria."
SK0501,1499,Yet, I still knew that she was the type of person that would sacrifice her own well-being for others...
SK0501,1500,Carrying everyone’s burdens by herself...
SK0501,1501,That's why, when I received the news that she had passed away, I made up my mind.
SK0501,1502,I want to carry on her will. I want to protect the capital, just like she did.
SK0501,1503,And for my own sake, too.
SK0501,1504,...I suppose that’s all I have to say.
SK0501,1505,You know, Ogami, I came here to work of my own volition.
SK0501,1506,To protect the peace of this city, and to cherish our audience's smiles.
SK0501,1507,I'm sure you feel the same, Ogami.
SK0501,1508,Yes, of course.
SK0501,1509,So let’s both do our best.
SK0501,1510,For my sister... <br> For everyone...
SK0501,1511,Yes ma'am!
SK0501,1512,Well, today I will tell you about the Anti-Kouma Corps.
SK0501,1513,The Anti-Kouma Corps was the army's predecessor to the Imperial Assault Troupe.
SK0501,1514,Ikki Yoneda, Kazuma Shinguji, Shinnosuke Yamazaki, and... Ayame Fujieda.
SK0501,1515,A special unit, comprising only those four, formed to defend the capital from evil.
SK0501,1516,Seven years ago... A Kouma appeared in Nihonbashi.
SK0501,1517,Even though it was just a single Kouma, the military and police were powerless against it.
SK0501,1518,However, the Anti-Kouma Corps managed to seal the Kouma away, albeit at great cost.
SK0501,1519,That incident made the government painfully aware of the need to defend against such evil.
SK0501,1520,As a result, the Imperial Assault Troupe as you know it was born.
SK0501,1521,The troupe is the fruit of the Anti-Kouma Corps' will.
SK0501,1522,And, of the four members, only General Yoneda is still alive today.
SK0501,1523,For the sake of those four, who protected the people from evil... We have to keep fighting.
SK0501,1524,...
SK0501,1525,Now then, today I’ll tell you about Ayame’s travels.
SK0501,1526,In order to recruit members for the Flower Division, Ayame traveled around the world.
SK0501,1527,She searched for suitable candidates for the Flower Division, girls with powerful spiritual abilities.
SK0501,1528,She sent me letters from various countries. America, France, China...
SK0501,1529,Whenever she did, I must be honest, I envied her.
SK0501,1530,I see, so she did all that...
SK0501,1531,Those same candidates make up the Flower Division we have now.
SK0501,1532,And you know what, Ogami? Recently, I've been thinking...
SK0501,1533,The people Ayame chose truly were the best people for the job. That includes you.
SK0501,1534,Kaede...
SK0501,1535,Ayame entrusted the Flower Division to me, so I'll continue to give it my all.
SK0501,1536,Don't give up. Even in the hardest of times, remember to never give up, Ogami.
SK0501,1537,Yes ma’am! I will do all I can to meet your expectations!
SK0501,1538,Now then, today I’ll tell you about Ayame and Major Yamazaki.
SK0501,1539,Both Ayame and Major Yamazaki were members of the Imperial Assault Troupe's predecessor, the Anti-Kouma Corps.
SK0501,1540,Major Yamazaki was a brilliant scientist who came up with the foundational designs for Spirit Armor...
SK0501,1541,And they say he had a stronger sense of justice than most.
SK0501,1542,Anyone could see that Ayame and Major Yamazaki were deeply in love with each other...
SK0501,1543,But their relationship crumbled when the Kouma War started.
SK0501,1544,What could have possibly caused that?
SK0501,1545,Now, this is pure conjecture...
SK0501,1546,But it seems that during their battles with the Kouma, Major Yamazaki became obsessed with certain questions.
SK0501,1547,What are these demons?" "Why do they exist?"
SK0501,1548,And "how are they so powerful?"
SK0501,1549,General Yoneda noticed that Major Yamazaki had changed, and he warned him many times.
SK0501,1550,But, in the end, no one could change his mind.
SK0501,1551,Not even Ayame...
SK0501,1552,When the Kouma War ended seven years ago, Major Yamazaki went missing.
SK0501,1553,And then in our recent battles, he appeared again as Cerulean Satan.
SK0501,1554,Justice by power... <br> Rule through evil...
SK0501,1555,Perhaps that was his conclusion...
SK0501,1556,Back when he appeared in front of the theater six months ago...
SK0501,1557,I wonder what Cerulean Satan... No, what Major Yamazaki was trying to tell us...
SK0501,1558,...
SK0501,1559,... "" "" () - . , ! ? ?! !!

SK0501<div id=\,423,My, you came here like clockwork, Ogami.
SK0501<div id=\,424,If you're asking about rumors, I'm all out. Sorry.
SK0501<div id=\,425,I see. That's too bad.
SK0501<div id=\,426,I'll have some more interesting tidbits for you another time, so look forward to it!

SK0501<div id=\,531,I should just go to another room.
SK0501<div id=\,540,I wonder if Sakura is inside.
SK0501<div id=\,541,It's just like Sakura to have a cute nameplate like this.
SK0501<div id=\,542,OK, let's check another room.
SK0501<div id=\,544,It's Ogami. May I come in, Sakura?

SK0501<div id=\,592,...She's not here.
SK0501<div id=\,593,I wonder if Sumire is inside.
SK0501<div id=\,594,This is a pretty subtle design, considering it's Sumire.
SK0501<div id=\,595,Let's check another room.
SK0501<div id=\,599,OK, sorry to intrude.
SK0501<div id=\,625,I-I see...
SK0501<div id=\,629,I wonder if Sumire is inside.

SK0501<div id=\,645,Good morning, Captain.
SK0501<div id=\,662,...
SK0501<div id=\,676,No, I don't.
SK0501<div id=\,680,You can always learn something new re-reading how you acted previously.
SK0501<div id=\,681,No, I don't.
SK0501<div id=\,683,You can always learn something new re-reading how you acted previously.

SK0501<div id=\,718,I wonder if Kanna is inside.
SK0501<div id=\,719,Kanna's... Well, I guess it's more of a nametag than a nameplate.
SK0501<div id=\,720,OK, let's check another room.
SK0501<div id=\,722,I wonder if Kanna is inside.
SK0501<div id=\,723,Kanna's... Well, I guess it's more of a nametag than a nameplate.

SK0501<div id=\,798,Oh, Captain.
SK0501<div id=\,817,Hmm, what to do...
SK0501<div id=\,831,OK, now it's my turn.
SK0501<div id=\,832,W-What the?! The ball hopped!
SK0501<div id=\,833,That was a jump shot.
SK0501<div id=\,834,It's a technique used to leap over an obstructing ball to hit the target behind it.
SK0501<div id=\,835,Wow... You're as awesome as always, Maria.
SK0501<div id=\,836,Heheh, you can learn it too if you practice.
SK0501<div id=\,841,OK, now it's my turn.

SK0501<div id=\,855,Wow... You're as awesome as always, Maria.
SK0501<div id=\,862,Yeah.
SK0501<div id=\,871,Iris... Is she inside?
SK0501<div id=\,872,So Iris's nameplate is shaped like Jean-Paul.
SK0501<div id=\,873,I better check another room, I guess.
SK0501<div id=\,877,OK, then. Excuse me...
SK0501<div id=\,882,I'll help you.
SK0501<div id=\,884,I'll help you.
SK0501<div id=\,891,Hmm...
SK0501<div id=\,892,I know! Why don't you help me study like before, Mon Frère!
SK0501<div id=\,893,Huh? Me?
SK0501<div id=\,895,Oh, good grief... I give up.
SK0501<div id=\,897,I know! Why don't you help me study like before, Mon Frère!
SK0501<div id=\,898,Huh? Me?
SK0501<div id=\,900,Oh, good grief... I give up.
SK0501<div id=\,912,OK... Huh? That’s not right, Mon Frère.
SK0501<div id=\,913,The answer sheet says “37, 21.” 3 times 7 equals 21. You got it all wrong!
SK0501<div id=\,914,H-Huh? Sorry, my bad.

SK0501<div id=\,917,The answer sheet says “37, 21.” 3 times 7 equals 21. You got it all wrong!

SK0501<div id=\,1027,Boy, looks like she was able to make it on time.
SK0501<div id=\,1029,Boy, looks like she was able to make it on time.
SK0501<div id=\,1030,Orihime... Is she in her room?
SK0501<div id=\,1031,The name plate has a simple design, but it sure looks classy.
SK0501<div id=\,1032,Let's go check another room.
SK0501<div id=\,1033,It's Ogami...
SK0501<div id=\,1036,Orihime... Is she in her room?
SK0501<div id=\,1037,The name plate has a simple design, but it sure looks classy.
SK0501<div id=\,1038,Let's go check another room.
SK0501<div id=\,1041,This is Kaede's room.
SK0501<div id=\,1042,I better check another room, I guess.
SK0501<div id=\,1043,It's Ogami. Are you there, Kaede?
SK0501<div id=\,1044,Oh, Ogami. The door's unlocked, come in.
SK0501<div id=\,1045,Right. Pardon me.
SK0501<div id=\,1046,Hi, Ogami. Did you need something?
SK0501<div id=\,1047,Have a chat.
SK0501<div id=\,1048,Ask about Ayame.
SK0501<div id=\,1049,Nothing in particular.
SK0501<div id=\,1055,I see.
SK0501<div id=\,1057,Y-Yes, sir!
SK0501<div id=\,1058,I would like to hear your story, Kaede... If that's OK with you.
SK0501<div id=\,1059,Why of course. Hmm... What should I talk about?
SK0501<div id=\,1060,No... Nothing in particular.
SK0501<div id=\,1063,Well then, I have to excuse myself.
SK0501<div id=\,1064,You're always welcome here.
SK0501<div id=\,1065,All right. Well, I should get going. Please excuse me.
SK0501<div id=\,1067,This is Kaede's room.

SK0501<div id=\,1073,Sorry, Ogami. Let's have a nice talk some other time.
SK0501<div id=\,1074,Phew... Being in my own room is quite relaxing.
SK0501<div id=\,1075,Now... What should I do?
SK0501<div id=\,1076,Make a call.
SK0501<div id=\,1077,Grab Cinematron.
SK0501<div id=\,1078,Maybe next time.
SK0501<div id=\,1079,Make a call.
SK0501<div id=\,1080,Maybe next time.
SK0501<div id=\,1081,I know, why don't I make a call?
SK0501<div id=\,1084,Let's do this later. I still have other stuff to do.
SK0501<div id=\,1085,I wonder if Reni's inside.
SK0501<div id=\,1086,It seems that Reni is not here.
SK0501<div id=\,1087,It's just a piece of paper from a notebook. I suppose that's fitting for someone like Reni.
SK0501<div id=\,1088,OK, let's check another room.
SK0501<div id=\,1089,I wonder if Kohran is inside.
SK0501<div id=\,1090,There's no response. Looks like she's in another room.
SK0501<div id=\,1091,A gear-shaped nameplate, huh? It's just Kohran's style.
SK0501<div id=\,1092,Let's check another room.
SK0501<div id=\,1110,Oh, Ogami.
SK0501<div id=\,1114,Anti-motion sickness pills.
SK0501<div id=\,1115,Disinfectant.
SK0501<div id=\,1116,Anti-motion sickness pills.
SK0501<div id=\,1117,Disinfectant.
SK0501<div id=\,1128,...
SK0501<div id=\,1130,...Huh?
SK0501<div id=\,1142,Hiya, Chief.
SK0501<div id=\,1147,Aren't you overthinking things?
SK0501<div id=\,1156,I-I see...
SK0501<div id=\,1177,I see... So that's how it came to be.
SK0501<div id=\,1179,That was hilarious!
SK0501<div id=\,1180,Huh... What do you mean?
SK0501<div id=\,1181,That was hilarious!
SK0501<div id=\,1187,Huh... What do you mean?
SK0501<div id=\,1189,Hmm...
SK0501<div id=\,1191,It'd be awkward for me if no one retorts it.
SK0501<div id=\,1192,I see... I'll keep that in mind.
SK0501<div id=\,1197,It'd be awkward for me if no one retorts it.
SK0501<div id=\,1198,I see... I'll keep that in mind.
SK0501<div id=\,1208,Oh well, guess I should go to another room.
SK0501<div id=\,1209,Huh? Looks like someone's in the bathroom.
SK0501<div id=\,1212,My body is moving towards the bathroom on its own...
SK0501<div id=\,1213,Go back outside.
SK0501<div id=\,1214,Oh no, my body is moving towards the bathroom on its own...
SK0501<div id=\,1217,...!
SK0501<div id=\,1219,Remain calm.
SK0501<div id=\,1220,Run away.
SK0501<div id=\,1221,Remain calm.
SK0501<div id=\,1223,Ch-Chief!?
SK0501<div id=\,1224,Eh!? Your glasses... are you wearing them!?
SK0501<div id=\,1225,Get outta here, Chief! Just get out, quick!
SK0501<div id=\,1226,S-Sorry! I'm getting out!
SK0501<div id=\,1227,...
SK0501<div id=\,1228,My apologies, Kohran. It was an accident.
SK0501<div id=\,1229,Unlike the showers, this bathroom is huge, so I have to wear my glasses.
SK0501<div id=\,1230,Now I realize I made a wise choice.
SK0501<div id=\,1231,Sorry. I'll be more careful.
SK0501<div id=\,1232,Well, since you apologized so earnestly, I'll forgive you this one time.
SK0501<div id=\,1233,Do that again and I'll never let you forget it.
SK0501<div id=\,1234,Phew... Somehow I got away without getting yelled at.
SK0501<div id=\,1235,Huh. So now she take baths with her glasses on.
SK0501<div id=\,1236,(I gotta get out of here before she sees me!)
SK0501<div id=\,1237,Phew... I think I got away before she realized I was there.
SK0501<div id=\,1238,If I'd been just a moment slower, I might not have made it. That was too close...
SK0501<div id=\,1239,Ah... Uhm... I...
SK0501<div id=\,1240,Ch-Chief!?
SK0501<div id=\,1241,Eh!? Your glasses... are you wearing them!?
SK0501<div id=\,1242,Get outta here, Chief! Just get out, quick!
SK0501<div id=\,1243,S-Sorry! I'm getting out!
SK0501<div id=\,1244,...
SK0501<div id=\,1245,My apologies, Kohran. It was an accident.

SK0501<div id=\,1250,Do that again and I'll never let you forget it.
SK0501<div id=\,1251,Phew... Somehow I got away without getting yelled at.
SK0501<div id=\,1252,Huh. So now she take baths with her glasses on.
SK0501<div id=\,1254,I better not bother her and walk away.
SK0501<div id=\,1260,(I gotta get out of here before she sees me!)
SK0501<div id=\,1261,Phew... I think I got away before she realized I was there.
SK0501<div id=\,1262,If I'd been just a moment slower, I might not have made it. That was too close...
SK0501<div id=\,1263,Hiya, Chief.
SK0501<div id=\,1270,Looks like no one's taking a bath right now.
SK0501<div id=\,1272,...Captain.
SK0501<div id=\,1278,Aren't you overthinking things?
SK0501<div id=\,1287,Uh...
SK0501<div id=\,1288,...
SK0501<div id=\,1300,Leave.
SK0501<div id=\,1302,...
SK0501<div id=\,1303,...
SK0501<div id=\,1308,...
SK0501<div id=\,1323,There's no use in standing idly by here. Let's move to another room.
SK0501<div id=\,1326,The heat from the steam processor makes this room hotter than the others.
SK0501<div id=\,1327,Ugh, I'm starting to sweat. What am I doing in this place anyway?
SK0501<div id=\,1336,Thank you.
SK0501<div id=\,1362,...
SK0501<div id=\,1389,H-Hello...
SK0501<div id=\,1391,H-Hello...

SK0501<div id=\,1495,A scarf given to me by Sakura. It's knitted with yellow yarn - my favorite color.
SK0501<div id=\,1496,Ayame and I almost never had a chance to live together, even though we were sisters.
SK0501<div id=\,1497,Hm...?
SK0501<div id=\,1498,That's not so unusual. Our family tree is more like a wisteria with the way we're connected.
SK0501<div id=\,1499,I always had a feeling that she would sacrifice herself at any time...
SK0501<div id=\,1500,Carrying all that burden alone.
SK0501<div id=\,1501,When I heard the news that she was gone, I made up my mind that I wanted to carry out her will.
SK0501<div id=\,1502,I want to protect Tokyo, just like her.
SK0501<div id=\,1503,And for my own sake, too.
SK0501<div id=\,1504,...That's all I have.
SK0501<div id=\,1505,You know, I came here to work and carry out my own will.
SK0501<div id=\,1506,To protect the peace of this city, and to cherish our audience's smiles.
SK0501<div id=\,1507,I'm sure you feel the same, Ogami.
SK0501<div id=\,1508,Of course I do.
SK0501<div id=\,1509,So let's do our best together.
SK0501<div id=\,1510,For my sister... and for everyone...
SK0501<div id=\,1511,Yes!
SK0501<div id=\,1512,Well, today I will tell you about the Anti-Kouma Corps.
SK0501<div id=\,1513,The Anti-Kouma Corps was the army's predecessor to the Imperial Assault Troupe.
SK0501<div id=\,1514,Ikki Yoneda, Kazuma Shinguji, Shinnosuke Yamazaki, and... Ayame Fujieda.
SK0501<div id=\,1515,This special squad only had those four to defend the capital from kouma.
SK0501<div id=\,1516,Seven years ago... A kouma appeared in Nihonbashi.
SK0501<div id=\,1517,Even though it was just a single kouma, the military and police were powerless against it.
SK0501<div id=\,1518,However, the Anti-Kouma Corps sacrificed themselves and managed to seal the kouma away.
SK0501<div id=\,1519,That incident made the government realize that it was important to prevent evil from rising up again.
SK0501<div id=\,1520,As a result, the Imperial Assault Troupe as you know it was born.
SK0501<div id=\,1521,The Imperial Assault Troupe is the fruit of the Anti-Kouma Corps' will.
SK0501<div id=\,1522,And of the four members, only General Yoneda is alive now.
SK0501<div id=\,1523,Those four who protected people from evil... We have to keep fighting on for their sake.
SK0501<div id=\,1524,...
SK0501<div id=\,1525,Well, I'll tell you about Ayame's travels.
SK0501<div id=\,1526,In order to recruit members for the Flower Division, Ayame traveled around the world.
SK0501<div id=\,1527,She searched for girls with lots of spirit power which made them suitable for the Flower Division.
SK0501<div id=\,1528,She sent letters to many countries. America, France, China...
SK0501<div id=\,1529,Whenever she did it, I must be honest. I envied her.
SK0501<div id=\,1530,I see, so she did all that...
SK0501<div id=\,1531,That's how she gathered everyone and formed the Flower Division we have now.
SK0501<div id=\,1532,So, Ogami. These days, I've been thinking...
SK0501<div id=\,1533,Ayame made the right decision choosing people for the Flower Division, including you.
SK0501<div id=\,1534,Kaede...
SK0501<div id=\,1535,Ayame entrusted the Flower Division to me, so I'll continue to give it my all.
SK0501<div id=\,1536,Don't give up. Even in the hardest of times, remember to keep it together, Ogami.
SK0501<div id=\,1537,Roger! I will do all I can to meet your expectations!
SK0501<div id=\,1538,Now then, I'm going to tell you the story about Ayame and Major Yamazaki.
SK0501<div id=\,1539,Both Ayame and Major Yamazaki were members of the Imperial Assault Troupe's predecessor, the Anti-Kouma Corps.
SK0501<div id=\,1540,Major Yamazaki was a brilliant scientist who made the basic designs for spirit armor.
SK0501<div id=\,1541,I heard that he also had a stronger sense of justice than most people.
SK0501<div id=\,1542,Ayame and Major Yamazaki were lovers...
SK0501<div id=\,1543,But their relationship crumbled when the Kouma War happened.
SK0501<div id=\,1544,What could have caused that?
SK0501<div id=\,1545,This is only a guess...
SK0501<div id=\,1546,But it seems that during their battles with the kouma, he became obsessed with certain questions.
SK0501<div id=\,1547,What are these demons?" "Why do they exist?"
SK0501<div id=\,1548,And "how are they so powerful?"
SK0501<div id=\,1549,General Yoneda noticed that Major Yamazaki had changed, and he warned him many times.
SK0501<div id=\,1550,But none of those warnings could have changed his mind...
SK0501<div id=\,1551,Not even Ayame's words...
SK0501<div id=\,1552,When the Kouma War ended 7 years ago, Major Yamazaki went missing.
SK0501<div id=\,1553,And then in our recent battles, he appeared again as Cerulean Satan.
SK0501<div id=\,1554,Justice by power... <br> Rule through evil...
SK0501<div id=\,1555,Perhaps that was his conclusion...
SK0501<div id=\,1556,I wonder what Cerulean Satan's... No, Major Yamazaki's thoughts were.
SK0501<div id=\,1557,Back when he appeared in front of the theater six months ago.
SK0501<div id=\,1558,...
SK0502,1,Well, we're safely on the road.
SK0502,2,Yes, it looks like it'll be another few hours before we reach Atami.
SK0502,3,Got it. Guess I'll just sit back and enjoy a peaceful bus ride.
SK0502,4,Hey, Mon Frère?
SK0502,5,Hm? What is it, Iris?
SK0502,6,I was playing cards just now in the back of the bus, with Sakura and the others.
SK0502,7,If you want, you and Maria can come join us!
SK0502,8,Oh, me too? What game are we playing?
SK0502,9,We're playing Tycoon. You two seem like you'd be great at it!
SK0502,10,Come on, Mon Frère, play with us!
SK0502,11,Sure, let's play!
SK0502,12,What are the rules?
SK0502,13,Let's not.
SK0502,14,Sure, let's play! It'll be a nice way to pass the time till we reach Atami.
SK0502,15,Really? I'm so glad we asked you, Ogami.
SK0502,16,All right, but I won't lose!
SK0502,17,I won't hold anything back, either.
SK0502,18,Ok then, let the game begin!
SK0502,19,Tycoon, huh? Could you tell me the rules?
SK0502,20,Sure. I'll explain it as simply as I can.
SK0502,21,The least we could do is join them, Captain.
SK0502,22,Yeah, you're right. OK, once you've explained the rules, let's play!
SK0502,23,Hmm... Let's not. I was hoping to take a nap before we reach Atami.
SK0502,24,Huhhh? Boring...
SK0502,25,He can't help it if he's tired, Iris.
SK0502,26,We'll play a round of Old Maid with Saki instead, all right?
SK0502,27,OK...
SK0502,28,Sorry about that, Ogami. Get plenty of rest.
SK0502,29,*yawn* Now that I've turned them down, I actually feel really sleepy.
SK0502,30,It'll be some time before we get there, so I'll just take a quick nap.
SK0502,31,Boss? Wake up, Boss.
SK0502,32,Mm... Mmrrgh...
SK0502,33,*yawn* I slept like a log.
SK0502,34,Hmmm... What should I do?
SK0502,35,C'mon, let's play! Don't you wanna play?
SK0502,36,Ogami's probably tired, Iris. He'll play with you some other time.
SK0502,37,We'll play a round of Old Maid with Saki instead, OK?
SK0502,38,Ah, Boooriiiing...
SK0502,39,Sorry about that, Ogami. Get plenty of rest.
SK0502,40,*yawn* Now that I've turned them down, I actually feel really sleepy.
SK0502,41,It'll be some time before we get there, so I'll just take a quick nap.
SK0502,42,Boss? Wake up, Boss.
SK0502,43,Mm... Mmrrgh...
SK0502,44,*yawn* I slept like a log.
SK0502,45,Figures you'd be good at cards, Ogami.
SK0502,46,It's true! You're so good, Mon Frère!
SK0502,47,You really know how to use your head, don't you?
SK0502,48,Hahaha, thanks.
SK0502,49,That wasn't bad, Ogami.
SK0502,50,Well, that's the way it goes, I guess.
SK0502,51,But it was a great way to pass the time all the same.
SK0502,52,That was fun, Mon Frère! Let's play again sometime!
SK0502,53,That's too bad, Ogami.
SK0502,54,Oof, that wasn't great.
SK0502,55,Cheer up, Mon Frère.
SK0502,56,It's all a matter of luck...
SK0502,57,You're right. Thanks, everyone.
SK0502,58,Yo, Boss! We're almost there!
SK0502,59,Really? Time sure flew by.
SK0502,60,We'll be able to see the ocean shortly.
SK0502,61,This looks to be the place. We're here!
SK0502,62,Kenrokuen", was it called? You can really feel the history behind this building.
SK0502,63,Ken... roku... en?
SK0502,64,I'm told this inn is quite famous, and has been in operation since the Edo period.
SK0502,65,We appear to be the only guests staying here, so we can be at ease.
SK0502,66,It's so peaceful and quiet. I'll really be able to relax.
SK0502,67,Hey, guys! I know this is kinda sudden, but y'all wanna go see the beach?
SK0502,68,From the bus, it looked like it's close by. How 'bout it, Boss?
SK0502,69,Sure, let's take a look.
SK0502,70,I need a break...
SK0502,71,Yeah, sure, let's take a look.
SK0502,72,That's what I'm talkin' about! All right, full steam ahead!
SK0502,73,Hmmmm... We just got here. I'd like to take a break first.
SK0502,74,C'mon, Cap, don't be such a downer.
SK0502,75,We might as well have a look, Ogami.
SK0502,76,A walk and a breath of fresh ocean air should do us some good.
SK0502,77,Yeah, Mon Frère! Let's go to the beach!
SK0502,78,Well, if you all insist... Why not?
SK0502,79,Hmmm... What should I do?
SK0502,80,C'mon, Boss, we've got plenty of time before dinner.
SK0502,81,A walk will get us nice and hungry, and we'll be back just in time to eat!
SK0502,82,Yeah, Mon Frère! Let's go to the beach!
SK0502,83,You're right. OK, let's go.
SK0502,84,Alrighty then, let's drop off our bags and head to the beach.
SK0502,85,The beach, huh? Can't wait.
SK0502,86,That's right, you probably never went to the beach much in Russia, did you?
SK0502,87,That's right. It's so cold in Russia, going to the beach would be ludicrous.
SK0502,88,Heh! That means now's your chance!
SK0502,89,OK, Flower Division, to the beach! Move out!
SK0502,90,Yahoo! Look at that ocean!
SK0502,91,Wow... The ocean's so pretty!
SK0502,92,We can play so much tomorrow!
SK0502,93,There's lots of stuff you can do at the beach. What are you gonna do, Chief?
SK0502,94,I'll just go swimming.
SK0502,95,Probably sunbathing.
SK0502,96,Smash watermelons, I guess?
SK0502,97,I think I'll just go swimming. I'm in the Navy, after all.
SK0502,98,Ooh, how cool!
SK0502,99,That makes sense. Maybe you could teach me proper swimming technique sometime.
SK0502,100,Hahaha, sure. If you want, then I'd be happy to.
SK0502,101,I'll probably go sunbathing.
SK0502,102,Huh, that's a very European pastime, Ensign!
SK0502,103,Sunbathing on a private beach is a staple of European vacations.
SK0502,104,I, too, enjoy going for a swim and gracefully lounging on the beach.
SK0502,105,Taking care not to get sunburnt, of course.
SK0502,106,I see... That sounds about right for you, Sumire.
SK0502,107,I guess we could all smash a few watermelons?
SK0502,108,OK! I love watermelon smashing!
SK0502,109,That'd be my pick, too. It's great for getting everyone fired up!
SK0502,110,OK then, we'll smash some watermelons when we head down to the beach for a swim.
SK0502,111,All right! I'll go get some watermelons ready for then.
SK0502,112,Heeheehee! Yay! I can't wait!
SK0502,113,What's wrong, Chief?
SK0502,114,Oh. Sorry. Guess I kinda spaced out...
SK0502,115,Ahahaha! C'mon, Chief, keep it together!
SK0502,116,Though I guess tuning everything out and looking at the ocean isn't so bad, either.
SK0502,117,Right, let's head back to the inn, everyone.
SK0502,118,Yeah! Once we're back, we can get our grub on!
SK0502,119,Beach this, grub that... You truly are simpleminded.
SK0502,120,What was that?!
SK0502,121,Ohohohoho! Come and get me!
SK0502,122,Grr, now you've done it! Wait right there, dammit!
SK0502,123,Good grief... Those two never change.
SK0502,124,OK, everyone, let's start heading back.
SK0502,125,OK. Come on, Reni, let's go.
SK0502,126,...OK.
SK0502,127,I can't wait to get back and take a shower.
SK0502,128,Heehee, don't you mean go in the hot springs, Orihime?
SK0502,129,Alrighty, let's go. We'll go on ahead, Chief.
SK0502,130,Sure. I'll be right there.
SK0502,131,The sea... It sure brings me back to my time in the Navy.
SK0502,132,Yo, Ogami!
SK0502,133,Wh-Who's there?!
SK0502,134,K-Kayama?!
SK0502,135,Hey, Ogami. Ahh, how lovely the actual ocean is...
SK0502,136,Getting to gaze at the sea with you like this... What a joy it is!
SK0502,137,Yes, the sea sure is lovely.
SK0502,138,What are you doing here?
SK0502,139,Yes, the sea sure is lovely.
SK0502,140,Indeed.
SK0502,141,What are you doing here?
SK0502,142,Ogami, please. Does a man need a reason to come gaze at the sea?
SK0502,143,That's... not the point.
SK0502,144,...
SK0502,145,That's fine, Ogami. Words are meaningless before the majesty of the ocean blue.
SK0502,146,You're here with me, and we have the ocean in front of us. That's more than enough.
SK0502,147,R-Right...
SK0502,148,A man's heart must be vast and wide like the ocean.
SK0502,149,And he must have the perspective broad enough to gaze upon such a vast body of water.
SK0502,150,They say "the frog in the well knows not of the ocean." You must never be that frog.
SK0502,151,I get what you're trying to say, but... What's your deal?
SK0502,152,Hahaha! Well, I must be going now!
SK0502,153,Adiòs, Ogami! Until we meet again!
SK0502,154,Kayama... Seriously, what's with that guy?
SK0502,155,Let's eat!
SK0502,156,All right, time to chow down!
SK0502,157,Kanna, you'll choke on your food if you don't slow down.
SK0502,158,*gulp* ...Grrk!
SK0502,159,See? Enough said!
SK0502,160,Hahaha, relax, Kanna, the food's not going anywhere.
SK0502,161,Th-This fish is... It's raw!!
SK0502,162,We call that "sashimi", Orihime.
SK0502,163,Sa-shi-mi? How am I supposed to eat this?!
SK0502,164,You eat it as-is.
SK0502,165,Put some wasabi and soy sauce on it.
SK0502,166,It's decorative, you don't eat it.
SK0502,167,You eat it as-is.
SK0502,168,Put some wasabi and soy sauce on it.
SK0502,169,I'll have it if you don't want it.
SK0502,170,You just eat it the way it is, Orihime.
SK0502,171,Really? Well, here goes...
SK0502,172,...
SK0502,173,It doesn't have a lot of flavor.
SK0502,174,It tastes great when you add a little soy sauce to it, Orihime.
SK0502,175,Ohhh, I see, you have to put sauce on it.
SK0502,176,How dare you trick me, Ensign!
SK0502,177,N-No, I just think you should enjoy its pure flavor without adding anything to it...
SK0502,178,Enough of your excuses!
SK0502,179,You add some soy sauce and a little wasabi to it, then eat it.
SK0502,180,Hmm... Well, here goes nothing.
SK0502,181,...
SK0502,182,Urk! My nose! It stings!
SK0502,183,Hahaha, that's the wasabi. The tingling feels nice, doesn't it?
SK0502,184,Phew... It's so intense, my eyes are starting to water.
SK0502,185,But it's got a fresh flavor you can't find in Europe. I think I like it.
SK0502,186,It's decorative, you don't eat it.
SK0502,187,Really? Kohran seems to be enjoying it, though.
SK0502,188,C'mon, Chief, you shouldn't tease Orihime like that.
SK0502,189,It tastes great when you add a little soy sauce to it, Orihime.
SK0502,190,How dare you trick me, Ensign!
SK0502,191,S-Sorry, I was just joking.
SK0502,192,I'll have it if you don't want it, I love sashimi.
SK0502,193,I don't not want it! I'm not about to give any to a Japanese man!
SK0502,194,O-OK...
SK0502,195,I'll give you my sashimi, Mon Frère!
SK0502,196,Huh? Are you sure, Iris?
SK0502,197,Sheesh, and now you're leeching off of a child? You're terrible.
SK0502,198,C'mon, Orihime, stop bullying him so much.
SK0502,199,Orihime, you eat sashimi with soy sauce and a little wasabi.
SK0502,200,Hmm... Well, here goes nothing.
SK0502,201,...
SK0502,202,Urk! My nose! It stings!
SK0502,203,That's the wasabi kicking in. Startled me, too, the first time I tried it.
SK0502,204,Once you get used to it, though, you can't get enough of that tingling sensation!
SK0502,205,Phew... It's so intense, my eyes are starting to water.
SK0502,206,But it's got a fresh flavor you can't find in Europe. I think I like it.
SK0502,207,Heehee... Looks like you don't have any problem with wasabi at all, Reni.
SK0502,208,Wasabi... A perennial herb of the Brassicaceae family. Its roots contain irritants.
SK0502,209,So long as you can receive nutrition from it, it doesn't matter how it tastes.
SK0502,210,Same as ever, I see, Reni...
SK0502,211,Hey! I need a refill!
SK0502,212,Heehee... And she's the same as ever, too.
SK0502,213,Hahahaha...
SK0502,214,Ahh, that was yummy! I'm so full!
SK0502,215,Heh, suppose I should eat in moderation and cut it off here.
SK0502,216,Goodness, you ate three pots' worth of rice... You're inhuman!
SK0502,217,By the way, where's the bedroom?
SK0502,218,In a traditional Japanese inn like this, Orihime, we roll out futons and sleep on the floor together.
SK0502,219,Huh?! Together?! You mean with the Ensign, too?!
SK0502,220,O-Of course not! I'm sleeping in a different room!
SK0502,221,Well, why not? Let's all sleep together. How about it, Ogami?
SK0502,222,Well, if you insist...
SK0502,223,That's a bad idea.
SK0502,224,Well, if you insist...
SK0502,225,Wh-What are you saying, Ogami!
SK0502,226,Saki, please stop kidding around.
SK0502,227,There is no way on earth I'm sharing the same room as a Japanese man!
SK0502,228,R-Right... That's too bad.
SK0502,229,No, that's a bad idea. I may be the captain, but I have to exercise some restraint.
SK0502,230,Really? That's too bad.
SK0502,231,But still, it's wonderful how disciplined you are, Ogami.
SK0502,232,R-Right...
SK0502,233,(...Sleeping together with everyone, eh?)
SK0502,234,Ogami? What's with that look on your face?
SK0502,235,He's obviously thinking dirty thoughts!
SK0502,236,H-Hey, why's everyone ganging up on me?!
SK0502,237,All right, that's enough chit-chat. Let's get ready for bed.
SK0502,238,Wait, Maria, aren't you forgetting something important?
SK0502,239,When you're staying at an inn, there's one thing you gotta do!
SK0502,240,Kohran, you don't mean...
SK0502,241,That's right! A pillow fight! A traditional Chinese pastime dating back 4,000 years!
SK0502,242,All right, count me in! Prepare yourself, Sumire!
SK0502,243,How amusing. Just don't come crying to me once this is over.
SK0502,244,N-Now hold on, everyone!
SK0502,245,Relax, it'll be fine. OK, ready? Begin!
SK0502,246,BWAH! Who did that?! Who threw that pillow at me outta nowhere?!
SK0502,247,Hahaha! Gotta stay frosty, Kohran!
SK0502,248,All right, Sumire! Time for us to counterattack!
SK0502,249,It seems push has come to shove! Prepare yourselves!
SK0502,250,Look out!
SK0502,251,Cover Sakura.
SK0502,252,Cover Iris.
SK0502,253,Cover Kanna.
SK0502,254,Sakura... I will protect you!
SK0502,255,You handle this one!
SK0502,256,Leave it to me!
SK0502,257,Gwargh!
SK0502,258,Thank you, Ogami!
SK0502,259,Iris... You can relax, I'm at your side.
SK0502,260,You handle this one!
SK0502,261,Leave it to me!
SK0502,262,Gwargh!
SK0502,263,You came for me!
SK0502,264,Kanna, I'll protect you with all I've got!
SK0502,265,You handle this one!

SK0502,268,Sorry 'bout that, Boss.
SK0502,269,You handle this one!
SK0502,270,Leave it to me!
SK0502,271,Aaaargh!
SK0502,272,Ah...
SK0502,273,Damn, now you've done it!
SK0502,274,All right, here I come!
SK0502,275,Reni, you help, too! It'll be good exercise for you!
SK0502,276,Roger. Target... acquired.
SK0502,277,L-Look out!
SK0502,278,Cover Sumire.
SK0502,279,Cover Kohran.
SK0502,280,Cover Maria.
SK0502,281,Sumire, let me be your shield.
SK0502,282,Providing cover fire...
SK0502,283,Over here!
SK0502,284,Gwargh!
SK0502,285,Ensign... I'm so glad...
SK0502,286,Kohran... I'll always be there to help you.
SK0502,287,Providing cover fire...
SK0502,288,Over here!
SK0502,289,Gwargh!
SK0502,290,Th-Thanks a bunch, Chief...
SK0502,291,Maria, I've got your back.
SK0502,292,Providing cover fire...
SK0502,293,Over here!
SK0502,294,Gwargh!
SK0502,295,Apologies, Captain.
SK0502,296,...Or not! Chestohhh!
SK0502,297,Eek!
SK0502,298,Ah!
SK0502,299,H-How dare you!
SK0502,300,Hehehhh! Serves ya right!
SK0502,301,Come on, Sakura, let's throw one too!
SK0502,302,O-OK, then, here I come!
SK0502,303,L... Look out...
SK0502,304,Cover Orihime.
SK0502,305,Cover Reni.
SK0502,306,Cover Saki.
SK0502,307,Orihime, you can count on me when the going gets rough!
SK0502,308,Sakura!
SK0502,309,On it!
SK0502,310,Gwargh!
SK0502,311,I can't believe I was saved by a Japanese man...
SK0502,312,Reni, it's OK to be protected sometimes.
SK0502,313,Sakura!
SK0502,314,On it!
SK0502,315,Gwargh!
SK0502,316,...
SK0502,317,Saki! I will protect you!
SK0502,318,Sakura!
SK0502,319,On it!
SK0502,320,Gwargh!
SK0502,321,Oh my, you protected me? I'm so happy...
SK0502,322,I'll leave this one to you!
SK0502,323,Here I gooo!
SK0502,324,...
SK0502,325,Ah!
SK0502,326,...Injuries sustained, minimal.
SK0502,327,Phew...
SK0502,328,Time for the finishing blow! Here I come! Toryaaaaahh!
SK0502,329,Aww, crap!
SK0502,330,The pillow ripped open!
SK0502,331,Oh, for goodness sake... That's enough, everybody.
SK0502,332,I'm glad the innkeepers forgave us so graciously...
SK0502,333,But let's make sure this never happens again, OK, everyone?
SK0502,334,Yes, ma'am...
SK0502,335,And Captain, it's your job to stop this sort of thing before it gets out of hand.
SK0502,336,You're right. Sorry.
SK0502,337,Eh, it's no big deal.
SK0502,338,You're right. Sorry. I'll be more careful from now on.
SK0502,339,Very well. As long as you're sorry, then.
SK0502,340,Eh, it's no big deal. What happens in Atami, stays in Atami, right?
SK0502,341,What are you saying, sir?! What can we do if we can't even follow the simplest of rules?!
SK0502,342,You're the captain, now start acting like it!
SK0502,343,Y-Yes, ma'am! I apologize.
SK0502,344,...
SK0502,345,It seems you're remorseful for what you did.
SK0502,346,All right then, let's all go to bed for the night.
SK0502,347,We can play around as much as we want outside, OK?
SK0502,348,Yes, ma'am! Let's roll out the futons, then.
SK0502,349,Sorry for speaking so harshly, sir.
SK0502,350,It's OK, Maria. You were right.
SK0502,351,I'll head over to my room, then. Good night, everybody.
SK0502,352,Good night, Mon Frère!
SK0502,353,Good night, Captain.
SK0502,354,Phew... What a day it's been.
SK0502,355,Still, it was pretty fun.
SK0502,356,Now to get a good night's sleep to prepare for tomorrow.
SK0502,357,(I can hear waves...)
SK0502,358,(Oh, right. We're close to the beach, aren't we...)
SK0502,359,(...)
SK0502,360,Ensign...
SK0502,361,...Hm?
SK0502,362,Eeensiiign...
SK0502,363,That voice...
SK0502,364,S-Sumi--
SK0502,365,Shh, quiet.
SK0502,366,Did you... need something?
SK0502,367,Did you have a nightmare?
SK0502,368,You shouldn't be up this late!
SK0502,369,Did you... need something?
SK0502,370,Did you have a nightmare? You can sleep next to me, if you're scared.
SK0502,371,Alas, I haven't had any nightmares.
SK0502,372,Oh. So what's the matter?
SK0502,373,Sumire, you shouldn't be up this late!
SK0502,374,My, and I came all this way to extend an invitation to you.
SK0502,375,I-Invitation?
SK0502,376,...
SK0502,377,Yes, stay quiet, just like that.
SK0502,378,Tomorrow, the others plan on inviting you to go to the beach, the mountains or the hot spring.
SK0502,379,But I'd love to go to the beach with you more than anything.
SK0502,380,How does that sound, Ensign?
SK0502,381,S-Sumire...
SK0502,382,Hold it right there!
SK0502,383,...
SK0502,384,Eep! N-No way...
SK0502,385,Sumire... Trying to pull a fast one, huh?
SK0502,386,My, whatever could you mean?
SK0502,387,Quit hogging Mon Frère all to yourself!
SK0502,388,Seriously, that's pretty low, Sumire!
SK0502,389,Hmph, I was just inviting the Ensign to come with us tomorrow! Is that so wrong?!
SK0502,390,Wh-What did you say?!
SK0502,391,Well, it doesn't seem like Ogami minds.
SK0502,392,*sigh* Just goes to show, you can't be too careful around Japanese men.
SK0502,393,What do you have to say for yourself, Ogami?
SK0502,394,Laugh it off.
SK0502,395,Pretend to be asleep.
SK0502,396,Get angry.
SK0502,397,Ha, hahaha... I, uh, don't really know what's going on, either...
SK0502,398,Come on! Out with it!
SK0502,399,Zzz... Zzz...
SK0502,400,Ensign! Quit pretending to be asleep!
SK0502,401,Explain yourself, right now!
SK0502,402,B-But I don't...
SK0502,403,All of you, knock it off! I was just trying to get some sleep!
SK0502,404,It's late. Go back to your room and go to bed!
SK0502,405,The captain's right!
SK0502,406,Out with it, Ogami!
SK0502,407,Out with what? I didn't do anything...
SK0502,408,Sumire, didn't I just say not to cause a ruckus?
SK0502,409,All of you are being too noisy! What time do you think it is?
SK0502,410,But Maria...
SK0502,411,But nothing. Everyone go back to your room.
SK0502,412,Apologies for all the noise, Captain.
SK0502,413,N-No, it's all right.
SK0502,414,If you'll excuse me, then. Good night.
SK0502,415,Yeah, good night.
SK0502,416,Good grief... A noisy day to the very end.
SK0502,417,I wonder... how... tomorrow... will be...
SK0502,418,*yawn* Now I... really feel... sleepy...
SK0502,419,Mm... Zzz...
SK0502,420,Mmm... Morning, huh? The weather outside seems nice, at least.
SK0502,421,Right, now to get changed and meet up with the others.
SK0502,422,Ah, good morning, Ogami!
SK0502,423,Morning, everyone. Nice weather outside.
SK0502,424,Uh-huh! We were just talking about where we're gonna go after breakfast!
SK0502,425,We've decided we're all going to the beach tomorrow...
SK0502,426,But since everyone wants to go to different places today, we're splitting up into three groups.
SK0502,427,Kohran, Orihime, and I are headed for the mountains. A hike oughta be pretty fun!
SK0502,428,I'll be taking Iris and Reni and going to the beach, like I told you last night.
SK0502,429,Maria, Saki, and I are planning on staying here and relaxing in the hot springs.
SK0502,430,What are you going to do, Ogami?
SK0502,431,Go to the beach.
SK0502,432,Go hiking.
SK0502,433,Relax at the inn.
SK0502,434,I'll go to the beach. It's been a while since I've had a swim in the ocean.
SK0502,435,You're just saying that because you want to see my swimsuit, don't you?
SK0502,436,Haha, sure, whatever you say.
SK0502,437,Yaaay, Mon Frère's coming with us! Isn't that great, Reni?
SK0502,438,...I guess.
SK0502,439,I'll go hiking. Hiking's pretty fun, every now and then.
SK0502,440,Right? We're going to the beach tomorrow, anyway!
SK0502,441,Oh? If the Ensign's coming, then maybe I should stay here.
SK0502,442,C'mon, don't be like that! Let's all get along!
SK0502,443,I think I'll stay at the inn and relax in the hot spring.
SK0502,444,I see, so you'll be here with us, then.
SK0502,445,Try to relax as much as you can, Captain.
SK0502,446,Ogami's staying here with us? Heehee, I'm looking forward to it.
SK0502,447,All right, once breakfast is over, everyone get ready and meet up at the entrance if you're heading out!
SK0502,448,Okaaay!
SK0502,449,Sorry, Ogami, but each customer is only allowed to purchase one photo at a time.
SK0502,450,I see. That's too bad...
SK0502,451,My apologies, Ogami, but each customer is only allowed to purchase one photo at a time.
SK0502,452,Oh, really? That's too bad...

SK0503,1,Yaaaay! The beach! The beach! C'mon, Mon Frère, hurry!
SK0503,2,Ohohoho... The children seem lively. Now, Ensign, let's make our way over.
SK0503,3,All right, time to show you the swimming skills I picked up in the Navy!
SK0503,4,C'mon, Reni, hurry! Let's go for a swim!
SK0503,5,...I'll pass.
SK0503,6,Why? The water feels great! C'mon, already!
SK0503,7,Now, Iris, if Reni doesn't want to, you shouldn't force it.
SK0503,8,Ensign, inflate this boat for me, will you?
SK0503,9,Ah, OK. I'll be right there.
SK0503,10,Sheesh! Sumire's hogging Mon Frère to herself already!
SK0503,11,We'll do it together, then, Iris. You wanna help out too, Reni?
SK0503,12,...Roger.
SK0503,13,Ohohohoho! Keep it up, Ensign! This feels great!
SK0503,14,All right, let's crank up the speed! Here we go!
SK0503,15,Come on, Sumire, let me ride on the boat already!
SK0503,16,She's right, Sumire. How about switching places with Iris for a while?
SK0503,17,Seriously, this is why I can't stand children.
SK0503,18,Wait, Sumire, don't stand up on the boat!
SK0503,19,Oh, Ensign, you think I'd lose my balance over something as trivial as this?
SK0503,20,...Whoa! Wh-Whoawhoawhoa!
SK0503,21,Ah! Sumire's gonna fall!
SK0503,22,Help Sumire.
SK0503,23,Careful, Sumire! Grab onto me!
SK0503,24,Whoooooooooa!
SK0503,25,E-Ensign!
SK0503,26,W-Wait, Sumire, don't cling onto me so hard!
SK0503,27,Ahhh, we're falling!!
SK0503,28,Whoooooooooa!
SK0503,29,Sumire, are you all right?!
SK0503,30,Huh? What's this? ...I-Is this what I think it is?!
SK0503,31,Ensign! That's... That's my swimsuit!!
SK0503,32,Y-You're right! When did that fall off?
SK0503,33,Well, at least we managed to catch it, right?
SK0503,34,...
SK0503,35,H-Huh? Are you mad, Sumire?
SK0503,36,Give me back my swimsuit THIS INSTANT!
SK0503,37,Oogh... You didn't have to go this far...
SK0503,38,Hmph! Now stay there and think about what you did!
SK0503,39,Hahaha! You look like the ball of rice in a kid's meal.
SK0503,40,Now I just need to plant a flag and... All done!
SK0503,41,I-Iris...
SK0503,42,Heheh, OK, let's make you into an even bigger ball!
SK0503,43,Reni, help me with his feet!
SK0503,44,...Roger.
SK0503,45,Y-You too, Reni? You guys are so mean...
SK0503,46,Zzz...
SK0503,47,Moooon Frère, wake uuuup! C'mon, get up already!
SK0503,48,Hm? Oh, must've dozed off at some point.
SK0503,49,Ah, I slept like a baby. *yawn*
SK0503,50,Huh?!
SK0503,51,Ta-dahhh!
SK0503,52,R-Reni...?
SK0503,53,...Is this really that surprising?
SK0503,54,What do you think, Mon Frère? Isn't Reni cute?
SK0503,55,I'm shocked.
SK0503,56,She looks cute.
SK0503,57,That's a nice swimsuit.
SK0503,58,I really am shocked. I never thought I'd see Reni in a swimsuit.
SK0503,59,Hm hm, you'll hardly attract any men in a swimsuit like that, though.
SK0503,60,A swimsuit like Sumire's isn't hydrodynamic. Results in too much wasted energy.
SK0503,61,...
SK0503,62,OK, that's enough, you two... But boy, what a surprise. I think it suits you, Reni.
SK0503,63,Doesn't it, though? You look super cute in it, Reni!
SK0503,64,...
SK0503,65,She... looks cute.
SK0503,66,You say that about every girl, don't you, Ensign?
SK0503,67,So what? Reni IS cute!
SK0503,68,Mon Frère said you were cute, Reni! Isn't that great?
SK0503,69,...Cute?
SK0503,70,Uh-huh! He complimented you!
SK0503,71,I-I see...
SK0503,72,That's a nice swimsuit.
SK0503,73,Goodness, Ensign, it's rude to compliment the outfit and not the one wearing it.
SK0503,74,Yeah! Especially when she looks this cute, too! Isn't that right, Reni?
SK0503,75,I don't mind... A swimsuit is the most functional outfit for the beach, that's all.
SK0503,76,Goodness... So typical for the both of you.
SK0503,77,...
SK0503,78,Don't be so quiet, Mon Frère, say something!
SK0503,79,Oh, sorry. This was really sudden, that's all.
SK0503,80,Goodness... As boorish as ever, Ensign.
SK0503,81,C'mon, Reni, let's go swimming!
SK0503,82,Ah! Wait a minute!
SK0503,83,Hahaha! See, Reni? Doesn't that feel great?
SK0503,84,Y-Yeah. The water's cold.
SK0503,85,Hehehehe! Yaaaaay!
SK0503,86,Goodness, children sure are energetic, aren't they?
SK0503,87,Even Reni is no match for Iris.
SK0503,88,Seeing them together like this, Reni really is a normal girl, isn't she?
SK0503,89,Getting to see this side of her makes having come here worth it.
SK0503,90,All right, here we go! One, two...!
SK0503,91,YOOHOO!
SK0503,92,Boy, this feels great! What a nice change of pace!
SK0503,93,Ahh, the air here's great! Not a whiff of smoke or steam!
SK0503,94,*pant* *huff* Hey... you three... Wait uuup...
SK0503,95,Oh, whoops, almost forgot about Orihime! C'mon, hurry it up!
SK0503,96,*pant* *pant* Good grief.
SK0503,97,Japanese mountains are so hard to climb! They're full of trees and skinny, zig-zagging paths!
SK0503,98,Man, you're pathetic. You could easily just run up a mountain like this.
SK0503,99,Don't lump me in with a meathead like you!
SK0503,100,Ooooh, you look just like Sumire, glaring at me like that.
SK0503,101,Keep making faces like that and you'll turn into a grump just like her!
SK0503,102,Achoo!
SK0503,103,What's wrong, Sumire? Why are you sneezing when it's this hot out?
SK0503,104,Huh... That's strange.
SK0503,105,Well, looks like Orihime's regained her energy.
SK0503,106,Quit lazing around and let's go, already!
SK0503,107,Big words for someone who was keeled over wheezing just a second ago.
SK0503,108,Eh, not that I mind. Let's go, Boss.
SK0503,109,Hey, why don't we head down to that river over there?
SK0503,110,It looks real clean. Let's go dip our toes for a bit.
SK0503,111,Sounds good. Let's go.
SK0503,112,All right, full steam ahead!
SK0503,113,Urgh! You little-!
SK0503,114,Ahahaha! That's it, Boss! Keep it up!
SK0503,115,Hahaha, looking good, Chief! Like a real pro fisherman!
SK0503,116,You caught a live fish with your bare hands? That's incredible!
SK0503,117,Are you one of those Hokkaido bears, Ensign?
SK0503,118,Hahaha, I think a bear would be better at this than me... Ah!!
SK0503,119,Hey, Orihime! That fish is coming your way!
SK0503,120,EEEEEK!!
SK0503,121,O-Orihime! Are you all right?
SK0503,122,I am NOT all right! My clothes are totally soaked! I don't believe this!
SK0503,123,Help Orihime up.
SK0503,124,Laugh at her.
SK0503,125,Here, Orihime, take my hand. Can you get up?
SK0503,126,...
SK0503,127,C'mon, no need to hold back.
SK0503,128,All right then, I won't! HYAH!!
SK0503,129,Ahahaha! Guess even you can screw up sometimes, Orihime.
SK0503,130,...What did you say?
SK0503,131,Oooh, now I'm mad! Let's see how funny you think THIS is!! HYAH!!
SK0503,132,Hey, Ensign! Quit staring and lend me a hand, already!
SK0503,133,(Huh, it's not every day that Orihime asks me for help.)
SK0503,134,Sure. Here, Orihime, grab my hand.
SK0503,135,Gotcha! HYAH!!
SK0503,136,Whoooooa!!
SK0503,137,Hmph! That's what you get for throwing fish at people!
SK0503,138,Ahahahaha! That looks awful refreshing, Boss!
SK0503,139,Yeah, guess this is what they mean when someone's "dripping with charm!"
SK0503,140,Now cool your head off and think about what you did, Ensign!
SK0503,141,Y-You're so cruel, Orihime...
SK0503,142,Ah... The water's great.
SK0503,143,Sitting in a hot spring like this washes all my weariness away.
SK0503,144,(...Hm?)
SK0503,145,Open air hot springs are supposed to make your skin really smooth! Come on, let's go in!
SK0503,146,Hmhm, no need to rush, Sakura, the hot spring's not going anywhere.
SK0503,147,That reminds me, this is apparently a mixed bathing hot spring. Do you think someone's already in?
SK0503,148,Huh?! Mixed bathing?! Why didn't you tell us sooner?
SK0503,149,(Eep! Nobody said anything about that!)
SK0503,150,(This is bad! I gotta find a place to hide!)
SK0503,151,Heehee, it's all right. It's only us staying at this inn.
SK0503,152,Y-You're right.
SK0503,153,(They're gonna find me! I've got no choice but to dive!)
SK0503,154,Oh, good, looks like nobody else is here.
SK0503,155,(Phew... Seems like I didn't get caught.)
SK0503,156,Really? I get the feeling we're not alone...
SK0503,157,(...!)
SK0503,158,Are you sure you're not imagining things? Look, there's no one else here.
SK0503,159,Heh, you're right. Must be my imagination.
SK0503,160,Heehee, but if Ogami were in here, it'd cause quite the commotion.
SK0503,161,...
SK0503,162,(Urgh... This is starting to hurt.)
SK0503,163,Come up for air.
SK0503,164,(I have to tough it out...)
SK0503,165,I've never seen a hot spring with water this cloudy before.
SK0503,166,This is what's called a "nigori-yu" hot spring, Maria.
SK0503,167,The baths at the theater are nice, but nothing beats a real hot spring.
SK0503,168,You're right. My body and soul feel so relaxed.
SK0503,169,(Urk... Guh...)
SK0503,170,Come up for air.
SK0503,171,(Urk.. This is getting harder and harder...)
SK0503,172,You're so stylish, Saki. I'm kind of jealous.
SK0503,173,Heehee, thank you, Sakura, but you're pretty attractive yourself.
SK0503,174,Oh, please. I'm still so young...
SK0503,175,*sigh* I wish I could be like you and Maria.
SK0503,176,You're you, Sakura. You're wonderful just the way you are.
SK0503,177,Heehee. By the way, this spring is really hot, isn't it? And there's so much steam, too.
SK0503,178,(Urghhh... Y-Yep, it sure is hot... I'm at my limit!)
SK0503,179,Come up for air.
SK0503,180,(I-I can't last any longer! I have to come up for air!)
SK0503,181,(Phew! Now I can finally breathe.)
SK0503,182,(All right, it's so steamy you can't see a thing! I can hide again!)
SK0503,183,Still, it's nice to go on vacation with everyone like this.
SK0503,184,Heehee, you just like being with Ogami, don't you?
SK0503,185,Th-That's not... Quit saying weird things, Saki!
SK0503,186,Hmhm, you're beet red, Sakura.
SK0503,187,Th-The water's just hot, that's all.
SK0503,188,W-Well I think it's about time I got out!
SK0503,189,Heehee, you're so cute when you're embarrassed.
SK0503,190,Well, Maria, we should get going, too.
SK0503,191,You're right. Let's go.
SK0503,192,(Am... Am I in the clear?)
SK0503,193,*GAAAAASP*
SK0503,194,I managed to avoid getting caught. That was too close.
SK0503,195,Boy, that was one heck of a long bath, though...
SK0503,196,(I-I can't take it anymore!)
SK0503,197,Blehhh...
SK0503,198,Eeek! O-Ogami?!
SK0503,199,C-Captain?! What are you doing here?!
SK0503,200,Oh, it's just like I said. It's no big surprise men would be here, too.
SK0503,201,Well, we might as well bathe together, since we're all here.
SK0503,202,I-I'm done for... My head is spinning...
SK0503,203,O-Ogami?! Ogami, wake up!
SK0503,204,Please keep it together, sir.
SK0503,205,Ungh... Where am I?
SK0503,206,Oh, Captain, you're awake.
SK0503,207,Ogami? Thank goodness.
SK0503,208,You really are a handful, Captain.
SK0503,209,Right, I collapsed in the bathing area, huh...
SK0503,210,Yes. I'm glad it wasn't anything too serious.
SK0503,211,Now, putting all that aside, sir...
SK0503,212,I know we're on vacation, but we can't keep causing a scene like that.
SK0503,213,She's right! The inkeepers had to carry you out of there and everything, it was an ordeal.
SK0503,214,O-OK, I'm sorry.
SK0503,215,Heehee. Try as you might, you just couldn't leave, could you?
SK0503,216,Well, next time that happens, don't hesitate to pop out and say hi.
SK0503,217,S-Saki?!
SK0503,218,Oh, what's the matter? It's a mixed hot spring, why shouldn't we bathe together?
SK0503,219,A-Anyway, if this ever happens again, we're going home and leaving you behind!
SK0503,220,Y-Yes, ma'am! I'll be careful from now on!
SK0503,221,Oh, were you taking a bath in the hot springs too, Ogami?
SK0503,222,Y-Yeah, I just got out.
SK0503,223,Oh? But we were just there, weren't we?
SK0503,224,I-It was a really short bath, in and out.
SK0503,225,Captain, you should take advantage of the hot springs while we're here. Take your time.
SK0503,226,S-Sure, I'll do that.
SK0503,227,Hey, Ogami? Could you teach me how to put on a yukata later?
SK0503,228,My belt keeps coming loose, I don't know what to do.
SK0503,229,Huh?! You want ME to teach you?
SK0503,230,Yes, I want you to teach me each and every step in great detail.
SK0503,231,Great... detail?
SK0503,232,Ogami, your face is all red...
SK0503,233,Oh, that's cause I, uh, dove under the water earlier, yeah.
SK0503,234,...You dove in a hot spring?
SK0503,235,Ah, c-crap! What I mean is, uh, well...
SK0503,236,Captain! Care to explain exactly what you meant by that?
SK0503,237,(Sheesh... In the end, I was destined to be caught red handed, wasn't I?)
SK0503,238,...And so we all had a great time at the beach.
SK0503,239,Heehee! It was fun, huh, Reni?
SK0503,240,Yeah... I guess.
SK0503,241,Haha, some things never change. Well, going to the beach in the first place is a big step for you, Reni.
SK0503,242,Seriously, that's a big difference from a certain someone who was wheezing all the way up the mountain earlier.
SK0503,243,Hmph! Japanese mountains are just like Japanese men: unpleasant!
SK0503,244,Heeheehee, maybe you should've stayed at the hot springs with us.
SK0503,245,The water was great. My skin feels all smooth now.
SK0503,246,Hmhm, well, at any rate, we all got to blow off some steam.
SK0503,247,All right, let's cap it off with another pillow fight tonight!
SK0503,248,Wait, Kanna! Haven't we advanced beyond such crude pastimes?
SK0503,249,Yeah, last night you ripped the pillowcase and got yelled at, remember?
SK0503,250,All that being said, though, it's still a bit early to be going to bed.
SK0503,251,I know! Why don't we all set off some fireworks?
SK0503,252,Fireworks? That's a great idea, Sakura.
SK0503,253,Fi-re-works? I don't know what those are.
SK0503,254,Uhh... I wonder how you say "fireworks" in your country...
SK0503,255,Well, the best way to learn is to watch! Let's step out to the yard!
SK0503,256,So this is a firework. It's a bit plain, but kind of pretty.
SK0503,257,These are called "senko hanabi." They're traditional Japanese fireworks dating back centuries.
SK0503,258,What a cute little light, huh, Mon Frère?
SK0503,259,Yeah.
SK0503,260,This isn't gonna cut it.
SK0503,261,Yeah. It's endearing how it keeps looking like it's going to go out, but never quite does.
SK0503,262,Uh-huh! I wanna light one now!
SK0503,263,Hang on, guys! Senko hanabi are fine and all, but you can't just settle for that!
SK0503,264,Hmm... I don't think this is gonna cut it. Don't we have something a bit more flashy?
SK0503,265,Well said, Chief! I was waiting for someone to say that!
SK0503,266,Heheh, that's nothing, Iris. Senko hanabi are fine and all, but you can't just settle for that!
SK0503,267,That's why I've prepared my own specially-made fireworks, just for such an occasion!
SK0503,268,Wow, that looks impressive. Fire it off and show us!
SK0503,269,You got it, Chief! Once it goes off, I wanna hear your best chant!
SK0503,270,Ready, everyone? Here we go!
SK0503,271,Tamaya!
SK0503,272,Sakanaya!
SK0503,273,Tamaya!
SK0503,274,Sakanaya!
SK0503,275,...What am I supposed to say, again?
SK0503,276,Tamaya!
SK0503,277,That's the spirit, Chief! Good choice!
SK0503,278,OK, one more time! All together, now!
SK0503,279,Tamaya!
SK0503,280,Sakanaya!
SK0503,281,Hang on just a sec! "Sakanaya"? Like a fishmonger?
SK0503,282,Ensign, when someone sets off fireworks, it's tradition to shout either "tamaya" or "kagiya".
SK0503,283,Ahahaha! Sure, fishmonger, why not? Why sweat the small stuff?
SK0503,284,Yeah, I like "sakanaya" better. Let's go with that!
SK0503,285,Sakanaya!
SK0503,286,Hahahaha! That's so weird!
SK0503,287,Oh brother. After all the trouble I went through with these fireworks, we're going with "fishmonger"...
SK0503,288,Um... What was I supposed to say, again?
SK0503,289,Wha-- C'mon, Chief, I thought you were ready! Your timing really sucks!
SK0503,290,Ensign, when someone sets off fireworks, it's tradition to shout either "tamaya" or "kagiya".
SK0503,291,For a chant like this, timing is everything.
SK0503,292,OK, one more time! All together, now!
SK0503,293,Tamaya!
SK0503,294,...You're killing the vibe, here, Chief.
SK0503,295,S-Sorry, I don't know the right timing.
SK0503,296,Don't think about it so hard. When the fireworks go off, just shout "tamaya."
SK0503,297,OK, one more time! All together, now!
SK0503,298,Tamaya!
SK0503,299,Phew... Today was a lot of fun.
SK0503,300,Y'know, taking a nighttime dip in the outdoor hot spring doesn't sound bad right now.
SK0503,301,Yeah, I think I'll do just that.
SK0503,302,Reni, is that you? Bathing?
SK0503,303,Yeah...
SK0503,304,Guess you can't bathe with the others since you're a guy, huh?
SK0503,305,Well, we're both men here, so we can help each other wash up... Wait, huh?
SK0503,306,Say, Reni, your chest looks... kinda... feminine...
SK0503,307,...
SK0503,308,U-uh... N-No way...
SK0503,309,Reni... You wouldn't happen to be... a girl, would you?!
SK0503,310,...Yes.
SK0503,311,Wh... WHAAAAAT?!
SK0503,312,*pant* *pant* I can't believe Reni was a girl this whole time...
SK0503,313,...Jeez, I got so carried away, I ran all the way out here.
SK0503,314,Ah... ACHOO!! M-Maybe I should head back to my room for now... 
SK0503,315,Hm? Is someone there? ...No way!
SK0503,316,Whoa!! R-Reni?! Were you here this whole time?!
SK0503,317,Yeah...
SK0503,318,S-Sorry! I'm leaving!! Take all the time you want!!
SK0503,319,...
SK0503,320,Whew, that was quite the shock...
SK0503,321,...Jeez, I got so carried away, I ran all the way out here.
SK0503,322,Didn't seem like Reni was phased at all, though.
SK0503,323,It's easy to forget Reni's a girl when she's stoic like that all the time.
SK0503,324,Sorry, Ogami, but each customer is only allowed to purchase one photo at a time.
SK0503,325,I see. That's too bad.
SK0503,326,My apologies, Ogami, but each customer is only allowed to purchase one photo at a time.
SK0503,327,Oh, really? That's too bad.

SK0504,1,Good morning, Captain,
SK0504,2,Good morning. Our vacation ends tomorrow, doesn't it?
SK0504,3,Let's all go to the beach today!
SK0504,4,All right, I'm gonna swim my ass off!
SK0504,5,Let's play together, Reni!
SK0504,6,Still, it was quite a shock to learn that Reni's a girl.
SK0504,7,Yeah, for real. Why didn't you say so sooner?
SK0504,8,...No reason. I didn't think it was necessary.
SK0504,9,Were you ever aware of this, Ensign?
SK0504,10,Of course I knew.
SK0504,11,I had a hunch.
SK0504,12,I had no idea.
SK0504,13,Yeah, of course I knew.
SK0504,14,Hmmm... So you peeped on her in the bath, knowing she was girl?
SK0504,15,Eegh?! H-Hang on a second, Sakura!
SK0504,16,I don't want to hear it!
SK0504,17,Ahahaha! She's mad at you.
SK0504,18,Yeah, I had a hunch that Reni might be a girl.
SK0504,19,I just thought it might be rude to ask her directly whether she was a girl or not.
SK0504,20,My, that reserved judgment is quite fitting for a captain, Ensign.
SK0504,21,Reni, let's be friends, but as two girls this time!
SK0504,22,OK...
SK0504,23,I had no idea. I thought she was a boy this whole time.
SK0504,24,Really? And you still peeped on her?
SK0504,25,N-No! That's uncalled for, Kohran.
SK0504,26,Ahaha, kidding, I'm kidding!
SK0504,27,...
SK0504,28,Well you went quiet real quick. That's pretty suspicious...
SK0504,29,You must've had quite the shock yourself when Ensign went in the bath, didn't you, Reni?
SK0504,30,Not really... There's no significant difference between men and women.
SK0504,31,*sigh* Aren't we philosophical today.
SK0504,32,The beach, huh? Yeah, we'll have a blast and end things right!
SK0504,33,All right, everyone, let's meet up in the lobby once we're all ready.
SK0504,34,Okaaay!
SK0504,35,Right, I should head back to my room and get ready, too.
SK0504,36,Let's see, now. Swimsuit, check...
SK0504,37,Pardon me, Captain. It's Maria.
SK0504,38,Oh, Maria? Come in.
SK0504,39,Please forgive the intrusion.
SK0504,40,We only have two days left of our vacation, sir.
SK0504,41,Don't you think we should call the theater and let them know how we're doing?
SK0504,42,Yeah, you're right.
SK0504,43,What a pain...
SK0504,44,Yeah, you're right. OK, I'll give them a call.
SK0504,45,Yes, please do.
SK0504,46,What a pain... I just wanna go to the beach.
SK0504,47,I know how you feel, Captain, but it's important to keep in contact.
SK0504,48,Kaede and the others are probably wondering how things are going here.
SK0504,49,O-OK, let's give them a call, then.
SK0504,50,You want to go to the beach as soon as you can, don't you, Captain?
SK0504,51,Let's call them first, then we can spend all the time we want at the beach.
SK0504,52,You're right. Let's give them a call.
SK0504,53,...Huh? Captain, where's the Cinematron?
SK0504,54,The Cinematron? It's right there, on the desk...
SK0504,55,...It's not here! Huh... Where on earth did it go?
SK0504,56,Let's look around the room for it. I'll help you.
SK0504,57,Right, I appreciate it. Crap, where could it have gone?
SK0504,58,That's strange. I don't see it anywhere around here.
SK0504,59,If the Cinematron's really gone missing, we're in trouble.
SK0504,60,Yes. We'll have lost our sole means of contacting the theater.
SK0504,61,What should we do, Captain?
SK0504,62,We should let everyone know.
SK0504,63,Let's look for it a bit longer.
SK0504,64,We should let everyone know.
SK0504,65,Let's look for it a bit longer.
SK0504,66,Forget about it.
SK0504,67,We should let everyone know. We might have a problem on our hands.
SK0504,68,You're... right...
SK0504,69,...
SK0504,70,...Maria?
SK0504,71,Let's look for it a little longer. We might be close to finding it, anyway.
SK0504,72,Yes, you're right. It's too soon to be causing a stir.
SK0504,73,Eh, forget about it. I'm sure somebody's just borrowing it.
SK0504,74,Now is not the time for jokes, sir!
SK0504,75,The Cinematron is our primary means of communicating with the theater.
SK0504,76,We can't just "forget about it"! That's far too irresponsible!
SK0504,77,R-Right, sorry.
SK0504,78,Hmmm... What could've happened to it?
SK0504,79,...
SK0504,80,Captain, perhaps we shouldn't tell the others about this.
SK0504,81,Everyone in the Flower Division's been looking forward to this beach trip.
SK0504,82,I don't want to worry everyone during their well-earned vacation.
SK0504,83,Maria...
SK0504,84,Telling them about this will only stress them out.
SK0504,85,Let's look for it ourselves for a while longer.
SK0504,86,Got it. We'll look for it, just the two of us.
SK0504,87,At any rate, I'm glad you're here to help.
SK0504,88,Hmhm, the feeling's mutual.
SK0504,89,Right then, let's search the inn.
SK0504,90,Oh, Ogami and Maria.
SK0504,91,You two came at just the right time!
SK0504,92,Oh, you've changed into your swimsuits already?
SK0504,93,Orihime insisted we try on our swimsuits right now...
SK0504,94,So... that we could compare them.
SK0504,95,Well, Ensign, which one do you like better?
SK0504,96,O-Orihime!
SK0504,97,Oh yeah, and you better not say "I like them both equally"!
SK0504,98,I like Sakura's swimsuit.
SK0504,99,I like Orihime's swimsuit.
SK0504,100,I like them both equally.
SK0504,101,I, uh... I like Sakura's swimsuit.
SK0504,102,Ogami...
SK0504,103,Thank you, Ogami. I'm happy to hear it!
SK0504,104,*sigh* Figures the Ensign doesn't have any fashion sense.
SK0504,105,Well, not like I expected much from you, anyway.
SK0504,106,I, uh... I like Orihime's swimsuit.
SK0504,107,Heheh! I didn't think you had an eye for fashion, Ensign!
SK0504,108,...
SK0504,109,Sakura...
SK0504,110,No, it's fine. Orihime's swimsuit IS quite nice, after all.
SK0504,111,I, uh... I like them both equally.
SK0504,112,Didn't I just say you couldn't say that?!
SK0504,113,Wh-What can I say? They're both good...
SK0504,114,Good grief, this is why you can't trust Japanese men, they're so wishy-washy!
SK0504,115,Ah...
SK0504,116,Hmmm... I don't think I can answer that question.
SK0504,117,*sigh* Just goes to show, Japanese men are so fickle.
SK0504,118,Ah...
SK0504,119,(Captain, let's try asking them about the Cinematron, indirectly.)
SK0504,120,Right...
SK0504,121,Have you seen the Cinematron?
SK0504,122,Have you been in my room?
SK0504,123,Nice weather we're having!
SK0504,124,Hey, you two haven't seen the Cinematron anywhere, have you?
SK0504,125,S-Sir, what part of "indirectly" didn't you understand?!
SK0504,126,Oh... Right...
SK0504,127,...?
SK0504,128,Cinematron? You mean that communicator of yours?
SK0504,129,I haven't seen it. What about you, Sakura?
SK0504,130,Sorry, I haven't seen it either.
SK0504,131,I see...
SK0504,132,Say, did either of you go into my room between last night and now?
SK0504,133,(Nicely done, Captain. Good thinking.)
SK0504,134,Why would I ever go into your room?
SK0504,135,I haven't been either.
SK0504,136,I see. Hmm...
SK0504,137,Uh, nice weather we're having!
SK0504,138,Yes, it's perfect swimming weather!
SK0504,139,...Is that really all you wanted to talk to us about?
SK0504,140,That's a little TOO indirect, sir...
SK0504,141,R-Right, sorry.
SK0504,142,...
SK0504,143,We won't get any information if you keep quiet, sir.
SK0504,144,Y-You're right. I guess I was spacing out a little.
SK0504,145,What are you two muttering about?
SK0504,146,Oh, sorry. It's private.
SK0504,147,Anyway, we have to go now. You two enjoy yourselves.
SK0504,148,OK. See you at the beach.
SK0504,149,Can't wait to see your swimsuit, Maria.
SK0504,150,Hmm, doesn't sound like either of them knew.
SK0504,151,I've been staying in the same room as them...
SK0504,152,But I haven't seen the Cinematron in there either.
SK0504,153,I see. All right, let's look elsewhere.
SK0504,154,Oh, Ogami and Maria. Did you need something else?
SK0504,155,Y-Yeah...
SK0504,156,...
SK0504,157,What's wrong? Your eyes are darting all over the place.
SK0504,158,No, it's nothing.
SK0504,159,Doesn't seem like it's here after all, Captain.
SK0504,160,Apparently not. Let's check another room.
SK0504,161,Looking at everything in the room EXCEPT for the girls in swimsuits... You're so weird.
SK0504,162,Hmhm, sorry, we didn't mean anything by it.
SK0504,163,OK, Captain, we should go.
SK0504,164,Doesn't look like it's here after all.
SK0504,165,Yeah. Let's check elsewhere.
SK0504,166,Why do you two keep coming here?
SK0504,167,She's right, sir, there's nothing left to see here.
SK0504,168,You're right. Let's check somewhere else.
SK0504,169,Oh for the love of-- What do you want?!
SK0504,170,Hmm... Where on earth could it be?
SK0504,171,If only we could find some sort of clue...
SK0504,172,Captain...
SK0504,173,And Maria, too! What's wrong?
SK0504,174,N-Nothing, it's just...
SK0504,175,What are you two up to?
SK0504,176,We just took a bath together! Isn't that right, Reni?
SK0504,177,Yeah.
SK0504,178,Right, you're both girls, after all.
SK0504,179,Right, today would be your last chance to bathe in the hot springs, huh.
SK0504,180,Why don't you take a morning bath, Mon Frère? It feels great!
SK0504,181,Shall we, Maria?
SK0504,182,Shall we, everyone?
SK0504,183,I'm busy right now.
SK0504,184,That sounds pretty nice, actually. Shall we, Maria?
SK0504,185,Wh-What are you saying?
SK0504,186,Have you already forgotten about your little incident yesterday?
SK0504,187,Oh, right, that happened.
SK0504,188,We have more important things to do right now, sir.
SK0504,189,Now's not the time for jokes.
SK0504,190,Y-Yeah.
SK0504,191,Let's go get ready for the beach, Reni.
SK0504,192,Roger.
SK0504,193,OK, bye-bye, Mon Frère!
SK0504,194,All right then, shall we, everyone?
SK0504,195,C-Captain, what are you saying?
SK0504,196,You wouldn't be saying that if Reni wasn't a girl, would you! You're such a pervert, Mon Frère!
SK0504,197,Let's go, Reni! We have to get ready for the beach!
SK0504,198,Roger.
SK0504,199,I'd love to, but I'm busy right now.
SK0504,200,Really? It feels so good, though.
SK0504,201,OK, Reni, let's get ready for the beach!
SK0504,202,Roger.
SK0504,203,OK, bye-bye, Mon Frère!
SK0504,204,Thank you, Iris, but the Captain's busy, so he can't take a bath right now.
SK0504,205,Really? You must have a lot on your plate, Mon Frère.
SK0504,206,OK, Reni, let's get ready for the beach!
SK0504,207,Roger.
SK0504,208,OK, bye-bye, Mon Frère!
SK0504,209,...
SK0504,210,Doesn't seem like either of them knew anything about the Cinematron.
SK0504,211,I don't see it anywhere in the changing room, either.
SK0504,212,Not a single clue to be found... Let's check another room.
SK0504,213,Seems like Iris and Reni have left.
SK0504,214,And I don't see the Cinematron anywhere. We should go.
SK0504,215,Figures nobody's here.
SK0504,216,No matter how much we look, I don't think we'll find the Cinematron here.
SK0504,217,Doesn't seem like anything's changed since we last looked.
SK0504,218,Yeah. Let's check another room.
SK0504,219,Oh, if it isn't Maria and the Boss.
SK0504,220,Hey, Kanna.
SK0504,221,I'm waiting for the others. I wanna make sure we all head down to the beach together.
SK0504,222,You guys finished getting ready?
SK0504,223,Yeah, we're ready.
SK0504,224,No, not yet...
SK0504,225,Yeah, we're ready.
SK0504,226,You can go on ahead if you want.
SK0504,227,Yeah, we're ready. We can head to the beach whenever.
SK0504,228,Captain, we're still not finished with our important business!
SK0504,229,Oh, right, sorry.
SK0504,230,Important business"? What do you mean?
SK0504,231,N-Nothing, Kanna, don't worry about it.
SK0504,232,No, not yet...
SK0504,233,C'mon, guys, hurry it up.
SK0504,234,Sorry, Kanna. We'll be ready in a little bit.
SK0504,235,No, not yet. We'll still need some time to get ready.
SK0504,236,You can all go on ahead if you want. We'll meet up with you there.
SK0504,237,Got it... Man, you're sure taking your sweet time, though.
SK0504,238,Sorry, Kanna. We'll head right down there once we're done.
SK0504,239,We'll need a bit more time to get ready. Can you wait just a little longer?
SK0504,240,If we're taking too long, you can go on ahead, we don't mind. We'll meet up later.
SK0504,241,Got it... Man, you're sure taking your sweet time, though.
SK0504,242,Sorry, Kanna. We'll head right down there once we're done.
SK0504,243,All right, just come to the entrance once you're ready.
SK0504,244,If you're late, we can meet up at the beach, that's fine.
SK0504,245,Thank you, Kanna.
SK0504,246,See ya later. Get ready quick, OK?
SK0504,247,Everyone's really looking forward to this beach trip...
SK0504,248,Yeah. We have to find the Cinematron, for their sakes.
SK0504,249,Yes. Let's do what we can.
SK0504,250,Kanna and the others are waiting just outside the entrance.
SK0504,251,Kanna's waiting just outside the entrance.
SK0504,252,Heyyy, Boss! You ready?
SK0504,253,Are you ready yet, Mon Frère?
SK0504,254,Sorry, not yet! I need a bit more time.
SK0504,255,For crying out loud... We'll leave you two behind if you don't hurry!
SK0504,256,We'll be waiting by the entrance, so come once you're ready!
SK0504,257,The Cinematron's nowhere to be found.
SK0504,258,Captain, why do you suppose it went missing?
SK0504,259,Maybe someone took it?
SK0504,260,Maybe I forgot it somewhere?
SK0504,261,Maybe someone took it?
SK0504,262,Maybe I forgot it somewhere?
SK0504,263,I can't say yet.
SK0504,264,Maybe someone took it?
SK0504,265,That's definitely a possibility.
SK0504,266,But if any of us in the Flower Division had it, I'm sure they'd report that to you.
SK0504,267,Yeah, you're right.
SK0504,268,Maybe I forgot it somewhere?
SK0504,269,Did you take it outside at all?
SK0504,270,No, it's been in my room the whole time.
SK0504,271,Then I don't think that's the case.
SK0504,272,Hmmm... I can't say yet.
SK0504,273,I don't want to assume any wrongdoing at this point in time.
SK0504,274,Just as I'd expect from you, sir. I feel the same way.
SK0504,275,Hmmm... I have no idea.
SK0504,276,Indeed, we don't have any clues at all.
SK0504,277,At any rate, we can't say for sure without looking around some more.
SK0504,278,Yeah. Let's check another room.
SK0504,279,No matter where we look, I'm not seeing the Cinematron anywhere.
SK0504,280,Let's check a different room, sir. 
SK0504,281,Oh, Ogami and Maria. What's the matter?
SK0504,282,I could ask you the same thing. Why are you still in your yukata?
SK0504,283,Everyone's going to the beach, but I have sensitive skin, so I'm staying here to keep watch.
SK0504,284,Seeing as this room is empty, I thought I'd take a nap here.
SK0504,285,And what about you two? Why haven't you gotten ready for the beach?
SK0504,286,You see, uh...
SK0504,287,I forgot something here.
SK0504,288,Have you seen the Cinematron?
SK0504,289,You see, uh... We're just strolling around the inn.
SK0504,290,My, you two must be good friends. I'm jealous.
SK0504,291,Could it be you two are planning on taking a bath together?
SK0504,292,S-Saki! Please don't tease us like that.
SK0504,293,Oh my, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to tease you.
SK0504,294,No, I just forgot something here.
SK0504,295,Oh my, that's no good. By all means, take a look around.
SK0504,296,Pardon us, Saki. We'll just be a second.
SK0504,297,By the way, what was it that you forgot? Do you want me to help you find it?
SK0504,298,N-No, that's fine, we'll look for it ourselves.
SK0504,299,(Good thinking with that excuse, Captain.)
SK0504,300,(Yeah, not bad for something I just came up with on the spot.)
SK0504,301,What are you two whispering about?
SK0504,302,N-Nothing. OK, Maria, let's start looking.
SK0504,303,We've checked every nook and cranny, but it looks like it's not here.
SK0504,304,So it seems...
SK0504,305,You didn't find it? That's too bad.
SK0504,306,By the way, Saki, have you seen the Cinematron anywhere?
SK0504,307,...Cinematron?
SK0504,308,Oh, you mean that transceiver of yours?
SK0504,309,I haven't seen it anywhere. Did something happen to it?
SK0504,310,No, it's nothing.
SK0504,311,Really? Well, all right, I guess.
SK0504,312,(Hmm, I can't think of any reason Saki would run off with it.)
SK0504,313,Hmhmhm, what are you staring at me so hard for, Ogami?
SK0504,314,I feel kind of embarrassed with you looking at me like that.
SK0504,315,Oh, sorry, I was just deep in thought.
SK0504,316,...We should probably head to another room, Captain.
SK0504,317,You're right. See you later, Saki.
SK0504,318,Come by again if you ever need anything.
SK0504,319,Doesn't look like the Cinematron is here.
SK0504,320,Indeed. Let's check another room.
SK0504,321,Zzz... Zzz...
SK0504,322,Seems like Saki's asleep.
SK0504,323,She did say something about wanting to take a nap, didn't she?
SK0504,324,...
SK0504,325,(Saki looks pretty sexy, sleeping in a yukata like that...)
SK0504,326,What exactly are you looking at, Captain?
SK0504,327,N-No, I was just, uh, looking for the Cinematron.
SK0504,328,Really? Because it looked to me like you were just staring at Saki.
SK0504,329,Doesn't look like the Cinematron's in here after all.
SK0504,330,Indeed. Let's look elsewhere.
SK0504,331,Zzz... Zzz...
SK0504,332,You really seem to like being in here, sir.
SK0504,333,N-No, it's not what you think...
SK0504,334,Then we should be going. We've been here plenty of times already.
SK0504,335,...Captain, please try taking this more seriously.
SK0504,336,S-Sorry.
SK0504,337,Oh, if it isn't Maria and the Chief.
SK0504,338,Hey, Kohran.
SK0504,339,What are you doing out here?
SK0504,340,I was just picking up the leftovers from our fireworks last night.
SK0504,341,I cleaned up a bit last night, but I couldn't get it all, since it was dark out.
SK0504,342,Really? That's nice of you, Kohran.
SK0504,343,By the way, you been making good use of the Cinematron, Chief?
SK0504,344,You should try getting in touch with the theater, seeing as you brought it all the way here.
SK0504,345,Y-Yeah.
SK0504,346,Actually...
SK0504,347,Y-Yeah. I'll make sure to do that.
SK0504,348,Thanks a bunch, Chief. With the Cinematron here with us, we've got nothing to worry about.
SK0504,349,Actually... About the Cinematron...
SK0504,350,C-Captain?!
SK0504,351,Hm? What about it? Did it break or something?
SK0504,352,N-No, it's nothing. Don't worry about it, Kohran.
SK0504,353,(Captain! I thought we agreed to keep it a secret from everyone!)
SK0504,354,(Oh... Sorry.)
SK0504,355,(Sorry, Kohran. You worked so hard to make the Cinematron...)
SK0504,356,...What's up? You two went quiet real quick.
SK0504,357,It's nothing, Kohran.
SK0504,358,Well, I'm gonna stay out here for a bit longer and clean up after the fireworks some more.
SK0504,359,You two go get ready for our beach trip.
SK0504,360,Thank you, Kohran. Let's go, sir.
SK0504,361,Yeah. Later, Kohran.
SK0504,362,Kohran worked hard to make the cinematron. We have to find it, for her sake as well.
SK0504,363,Yeah...
SK0504,364,Oh, you're back? Didja need something?
SK0504,365,N-No, not really.
SK0504,366,Hmm, sounds kinda fishy! You two've been lurking around for a while now.
SK0504,367,And when I try asking you about it, you seem kinda on edge.
SK0504,368,Y-You're just imagining things.
SK0504,369,All right, sir, let's get going.
SK0504,370,R-Right. Later, Kohran.
SK0504,371,All right. Well, later.
SK0504,372,Kohran's pretty sharp, isn't she.
SK0504,373,We should be careful not to cause her any undue worry.
SK0504,374,Huh? Kohran's gone.
SK0504,375,She's probably not too far off, cleaning up after the fireworks.
SK0504,376,We should get going. I don't think the Cinematron's here in the yard.
SK0504,377,Well, if it is here, I'm sure Kohran will find it while she's cleaning up.
SK0504,378,Oh, Maria and the Ensign.
SK0504,379,Did you come here to cool yourselves off?
SK0504,380,Something like that.
SK0504,381,Our holiday is almost over.
SK0504,382,What about this trip left the biggest impression on you, Ensign?
SK0504,383,The pillow fight.
SK0504,384,The fireworks.
SK0504,385,The beach.
SK0504,386,Getting rowdy at night.
SK0504,387,The fireworks.
SK0504,388,Your swimsuit.
SK0504,389,Getting rowdy at night.
SK0504,390,The fireworks.
SK0504,391,The hike.
SK0504,392,Getting rowdy at night.
SK0504,393,The fireworks.
SK0504,394,Bathing in the hot spring.
SK0504,395,Hmm... Probably how we got rowdy on our first night.
SK0504,396,Yes, pillow fights aren't exactly high-brow entertainment, but they do get the blood pumping.
SK0504,397,Are you forgetting about the scene you caused by sneaking into the Captain's room, Sumire?
SK0504,398,Oh, right. That did happen too, didn't it.
SK0504,399,Hmm... Probably setting fireworks off with everyone.
SK0504,400,Those fireworks certainly were beautiful.
SK0504,401,The senko hanabi, the rockets... They were equally beautiful.
SK0504,402,Hmm... Probably our trip to the beach together.
SK0504,403,Ohohohoho! I knew you'd say that.
SK0504,404,Going to the beach with you also left the biggest impression on me.
SK0504,405,Hmm... Probably the hike on our second day here.
SK0504,406,I hear Orihime fell into the river.
SK0504,407,And then the captain fell in too, haha.
SK0504,408,Hahaha. I got completely soaked, but it makes for a nice memory.
SK0504,409,Hmm... Probably when I stayed at the inn to relax in the hot spring.
SK0504,410,OK, but please refrain from diving while in the hot springs from now on.
SK0504,411,Good grief. I was quite surprised to hear about that myself, you know.
SK0504,412,I-I already said I'm sorry. Besides, it's not like I did it on purpose...
SK0504,413,Yeah, definitely the part where your swimsuit came off.
SK0504,414,Ensign, please! You're so crude.
SK0504,415,Sumire's swimsuit? What's this about, Captain?
SK0504,416,N-Nothing, nothing at all.
SK0504,417,So much happened during this trip, it's hard to put it all into words.
SK0504,418,That's certainly true.
SK0504,419,At any rate, I'm glad we were able to have such a wonderful summer vacation.
SK0504,420,We only have two days left. Let's enjoy ourselves as much as we can at the beach today.
SK0504,421,Yeah, we will.
SK0504,422,Now then, if you'll excuse me. Take care.
SK0504,423,A wonderful summer vacation, huh?
SK0504,424,We have to find the Cinematron, for everyone's sakes.
SK0504,425,That's right! Why didn't I think of that sooner?
SK0504,426,What's up, Maria?
SK0504,427,Wait here a moment, Captain. I'll be right back.
SK0504,428,H-Hey! Maria!
SK0504,429,...And she's gone. What's she in a hurry for?
SK0504,430,...
SK0504,431,...
SK0504,432,...
SK0504,433,... She sure is taking her time.
SK0504,434,Captain! Sorry to keep you waiting!
SK0504,435,What was that all about, Maria?
SK0504,436,Captain, take a look at this.
SK0504,437,That's... That's a piece of the Cinematron!
SK0504,438,Where did you find this, Maria?
SK0504,439,I thought I'd ask the innkeepers about the Cinematron, just to be safe.
SK0504,440,Unfortunately, nobody here has seen it, but...
SK0504,441,While their children were taking a walk on the beach, they picked this up.
SK0504,442,Then that means... Someone took the Cinematron out of the inn!
SK0504,443,What's more, there's a high likelihood that it's already been smashed to pieces.
SK0504,444,I was told exactly where the children found this. Let's have a look, Captain!
SK0504,445,OK, let's hurry!
SK0504,446,According to what the kids said, it should be somewhere around here.
SK0504,447,Yes.
SK0504,448,But why would there be pieces of it on the beach?
SK0504,449,Someone must've taken it here and broken it.
SK0504,450,Yes, that's a reasonable assumption...
SK0504,451,...but who would do that, and why?
SK0504,452,...! Captain, over there! I see something shining!
SK0504,453,What?! Where?!
SK0504,454,In the shade over there. Let's take a look.
SK0504,455,There's no mistaking it... This is my Cinematron!
SK0504,456,It's just as I thought. Someone took the Cinematron, brought it here and smashed it.
SK0504,457,But why would anyone do that?
SK0504,458,Could it be a burglar?
SK0504,459,Could this be a prank?
SK0504,460,Was someone trying to use it?
SK0504,461,Could it be a burglar?
SK0504,462,To prevent us from making transmissions?
SK0504,463,Was someone trying to use it?
SK0504,464,Could it be a burglar, looking for something expensive?
SK0504,465,If that were the case, wouldn't they have taken something that looked more valuable?
SK0504,466,It doesn't seem like anyone else's valuables were stolen.
SK0504,467,You're right. It'd definitely be weird for a burglar to steal only this.
SK0504,468,In which case, it has to be a different reason.
SK0504,469,Yes, perhaps.
SK0504,470,Could it be someone playing a prank on us?
SK0504,471,Hmmm... This seems a bit too extreme to be a prank.
SK0504,472,You're right. In which case...
SK0504,473,Could it be someone wanted to use it?
SK0504,474,Yes, it's certainly plausible that someone intended use it.
SK0504,475,But if all they wanted to do was use it, then there'd be no need to break it afterward.
SK0504,476,Yeah, that's definitely true.
SK0504,477,Could it be... Whoever did this was trying to prevent us from making any transmissions?
SK0504,478,Yes, I was thinking exactly the same thing.
SK0504,479,Hmmm... I have no idea.
SK0504,480,Indeed, all we can do is speculate. However...
SK0504,481,Now, this is just a wild guess...
SK0504,482,But I think the culprit doesn't want us making any transmissions.
SK0504,483,We brought it here with us to contact HQ in case of emergencies...
SK0504,484,You don't mean they're trying to prevent that, are you?
SK0504,485,I'm not sure yet, but it's certainly possible.
SK0504,486,In which case, we have to proceed extremely carefully.
SK0504,487,First we need to find some kind of clue relating to the culprit.
SK0504,488,OK, let's investigate the area.
SK0504,489,Roger that.
SK0504,490,Captain, it appears there's a cave over there. Shall we investigate it?
SK0504,491,All right, let's have a look.
SK0504,492,It seems to be a natural formation. It's pretty dark inside.
SK0504,493,I know, I'll use this lighter to light the way.
SK0504,494,Captain, light the end of this stick on fire and throw it into the cave.
SK0504,495,O-OK... Like that?
SK0504,496,It seems to still be burning. Let's go in.
SK0504,497,What was that for, Maria?
SK0504,498,If the fire's still burning, that means the air inside is safe to breathe.
SK0504,499,I see. Just what I'd expect from you, Maria.
SK0504,500,Hmhm, my past experience came in handy.
SK0504,501,Right then, let's move on, sir.
SK0504,502,This cave just keeps on going...
SK0504,503,The ground is quite slippery and wet, too.
SK0504,504,It could be that the water will reach here when the tide comes up.
SK0504,505,I... don't really know how to swim, so... I'm a little nervous.
SK0504,506,I see... Well, we'll be fine, so long as we're careful.
SK0504,507,At any rate, we should watch our step.
SK0504,508,We could get hurt pretty badly if we fell over in here.
SK0504,509,Right.
SK0504,510,Seems like this is where the cave ends.
SK0504,511,Captain, come see this!
SK0504,512,Is this... a wireless transceiver?!
SK0504,513,Who's making calls in a place like this?
SK0504,514,...!
SK0504,515,The transceiver!
SK0504,516,Seems like a transmission's come in, but from who?!
SK0504,517,What should we do, Captain?
SK0504,518,Answer it.
SK0504,519,Ignore it.
SK0504,520,All right, let's try answering it!
SK0504,521,It could lead to a clue.
SK0504,522,Right, let's try it.
SK0504,523,No, let's not.
SK0504,524,We don't know who it is on the other end, we can't risk exposing ourselves.
SK0504,525,But this is the ideal chance to find out who the culprit is.
SK0504,526,Let's do it, Captain. I think it's worth the risk.
SK0504,527,...OK. Let's answer it.
SK0504,528,Let's do it, Captain. This is the perfect chance to find out who the culprit is.
SK0504,529,...OK. Let's answer it.
SK0504,530,If the transceiver is here, then it wouldn't be unlikely for the culprit to show up.
SK0504,531,You keep watch, Captain. I'll answer the transmission.
SK0504,532,OK, got it. It's all yours, Maria.
SK0504,533,OK...
SK0504,534,Suiko, is that you? It's me, Kongo.
SK0504,535,(Kongo?! As in the Black Demons' Kongo?!)
SK0504,536,How's the plan coming along? Did you manage to destroy their transceiver?
SK0504,537,Yeah...
SK0504,538,Heheh, really? Then the Assault Troupe's a bunch of sitting ducks!
SK0504,539,You really are one hell of a woman.
SK0504,540,(A woman? The owner of this transceiver's a woman?)
SK0504,541,By the way, why's your voice sound all weird?
SK0504,542,...I have a cold.
SK0504,543,Gotcha. Heheh, so even YOU catch colds, huh?
SK0504,544,...That's none of your business.
SK0504,545,Gahahaha! Right, I'll start heading over there with reinforcements, like we planned.
SK0504,546,By the way, which way should I come from, the sea or the mountains?
SK0504,547,(What should I tell him, Captain?)
SK0504,548,(Hmm... Let's see...)
SK0504,549,From the sea.
SK0504,550,From the mountains.
SK0504,551,(Tell him to come from the sea. We'll cut him off at the beach.)
SK0504,552,OK, send your reinforcements in by sea.
SK0504,553,From the sea, huh? Gotcha.
SK0504,554,Well, I don't know if you'll even need the reinforcements, since they're unarmed, but better safe than sorry.
SK0504,555,(Tell him to come from the mountains. We'll cut him off at the base.)
SK0504,556,OK, send your reinforcements in through the mountains.
SK0504,557,From the mountains, huh? Gotcha.
SK0504,558,Well, I don't know if you'll even need the reinforcements, since they're unarmed, but better safe than sorry.
SK0504,559,...
SK0504,560,All right, wait for me, Suiko!
SK0504,561,...We've got quite the situation on our hands, Captain.
SK0504,562,Yeah. I can't believe the Black Demons' plans have gotten this far without us noticing.
SK0504,563,They intended on picking us off unarmed, with no way of contacting the theater.
SK0504,564,We should get in touch with the theater as soon as we can, sir, and have them bring the Koubu to us.
SK0504,565,Yeah. Perfect, we can even us this transceiver.
SK0504,566,Hello, you've reached the Imperial Assault Troupe's Ginza Headquarters.
SK0504,567,Kaede? This is Ogami!
SK0504,568,We have an emergency! We've received word that the Black Demons are on their way!
SK0504,569,What?!
SK0504,570,Someone destroyed the Cinematron so that we couldn't get in touch with you.
SK0504,571,What a mess... We'll be right there with the Soaring Whale!
SK0504,572,OK, please hurry!
SK0504,573,There, that should do it. OK, Maria, let's hurry on back to the others!
SK0504,574,Yes, sir!
SK0504,575,Ah?! Captain! Look, behind you!
SK0504,576,D-Damn! The tide must've risen at some point! The exit's completely flooded!
SK0504,577,The Black Demons will be here at any minute, but now we can't get out.
SK0504,578,...
SK0504,579,(That's right, Maria said she doesn't know how to swim...)
SK0504,580,Captain, you go on ahead and swim out.
SK0504,581,Huh?! What are you saying, Maria?!
SK0504,582,You don't mean you want me to leave you here, do you?
SK0504,583,I don't want to hold you back, sir.
SK0504,584,As someone who abandoned her country and lost her family...
SK0504,585,...you and the Flower Division are priceless to me.
SK0504,586,Maria...
SK0504,587,The others need you, sir.
SK0504,588,You have to get out of here, quickly! I don't want to lose them as well!
SK0504,589,Maria... You're a part of the Flower Division, too.
SK0504,590,There's nothing to be afraid of. Just hold my hand and I'll get us both out of here.
SK0504,591,But sir...
SK0504,592,Cheer her up gently.
SK0504,593,Forcefully encourage her.
SK0504,594,It's all right, Maria. I'll never let you go.
SK0504,595,Please... You have to believe me.
SK0504,596,Captain...
SK0504,597,Don't be stupid, Maria! There's no way I'm leaving you behind in a place like this!
SK0504,598,Let's get out of here! I'm not leaving without you!
SK0504,599,Captain...
SK0504,600,Maria... You'll come with me, won't you?
SK0504,601,...All right. I'll go with you, sir.
SK0504,602,...
SK0504,603,...
SK0504,604,Captain... will you... protect me?
SK0504,605,Maria...
SK0504,606,Of course I will. I'd be unfit to be captain if I couldn't.
SK0504,607,OK...
SK0504,608,Now, Maria, take my hand.
SK0504,609,I promise I won't let go.
SK0504,610,Please... Believe me.
SK0504,611,OK...
SK0504,612,All right then, here we go!
SK0504,613,...
SK0504,614,(C'mon, Maria... You've got this!)
SK0504,615,...
SK0504,616,(Just 10 meters left...)
SK0504,617,...
SK0504,618,(5 meters left...)
SK0504,619,...
SK0504,620,(We're almost there, Maria!)
SK0504,621,...
SK0504,622,(...!! She's gone limp!!)
SK0504,623,...
SK0504,624,Thank god, she's still breathing!
SK0504,625,Maria... Maria!!
SK0504,626,Maria, stay with me!
SK0504,627,...
SK0504,628,At any rate, let's get you on the shore!
SK0504,629,...
SK0504,630,Maria...
SK0504,631,Hold her hand.
SK0504,632,Pray.
SK0504,633,Hold her hand.
SK0504,634,Pray.
SK0504,635,Perform mouth-to-mouth resuscitation.
SK0504,636,I promised you, Maria. I won't let go of your hand.
SK0504,637,Mmm...
SK0504,638,Ah! Her hand's gripping mine back!
SK0504,639,...Ah!
SK0504,640,Maria, are you all right?
SK0504,641,I never let your hand go, just as I promised.
SK0504,642,Captain...
SK0504,643,...No choice but to employ mouth-to-mouth resuscitation.
SK0504,644,M-Maria...
SK0504,645,Mmm...
SK0504,646,...Ah!
SK0504,647,Maria, a-are you awake?
SK0504,648,C-Captain...?
SK0504,649,You look... disappointed, somehow.
SK0504,650,O-Of course not! I'm so glad you're OK.
SK0504,651,She seems to be breathing normally. There's nothing left to do but pray.
SK0504,652,(Maria, please, wake up!)
SK0504,653,Mmm...
SK0504,654,Ah! She's regained consciousness!
SK0504,655,...Ah!
SK0504,656,Maria, are you all right?!
SK0504,657,C-Captain... did you... save me?
SK0504,658,It's all right now, Maria! You did great.
SK0504,659,Captain...
SK0504,660,...
SK0504,661,Mmm...
SK0504,662,Ah! She's regained consciousness!
SK0504,663,...Ah!
SK0504,664,Maria, are you all right?!
SK0504,665,C-Captain... did you... save me?
SK0504,666,Yeah. You're safe now.
SK0504,667,Thank you, sir... I mean it.
SK0504,668,I'm just glad you made it out of there safely.
SK0504,669,I can still feel the warmth and strength of your hand, Captain.
SK0504,670,You held my hand the whole time.
SK0504,671,Of course. I promised I wouldn't let go, didn't I?
SK0504,672,Captain...
SK0504,673,...!
SK0504,674,That noise! It's the Soaring Whale!
SK0504,675,Sorry to keep you waiting, Ogami! The Koubu are prepped for airdrop!
SK0504,676,Understood!
SK0504,677,Let's go get the others, Captain!
SK0504,678,Yeah. Black Demons, it's time for you to see what the Flower Division can do!
SK0504,679,Sorry, Ogami, but each customer is only allowed to purchase one photo at a time.
SK0504,680,I see. That's too bad.
SK0504,681,So sorry, Ogami, but each customer is only allowed to purchase one photo at a time.

SK0505,1,Yesterday sure was crazy, but it was a fun summer vacation nonetheless.
SK0505,2,Well, I suppose a plebeian vacation like that isn't so bad every now and then.
SK0505,3,By the way, Chief, what were you up to while we were at the beach?
SK0505,4,Yeah, I wanted to play with you, Mon Frère!
SK0505,5,Hahaha, sorry, sorry. I was busy with something.
SK0505,6,Speaking of which, Maria wasn't there either.
SK0505,7,Yeah, Maria, where the hell were ya?!
SK0505,8,I was also busy. Sorry I couldn't join you all.
SK0505,9,You're so weird, Maria. We came all this way and you didn't swim even once!
SK0505,10,...
SK0505,11,Hmhmhm...
SK0505,12,Hahahaha!
SK0505,13,Wh-What's this all of a sudden? You're creepin' me out!
SK0505,14,S-Sorry, it's nothing.
SK0505,15,All right, everyone, let's go home.
SK0505,16,Full steam ahead to the Imperial Theater!
SK0505,17,Sorry, Ogami, but each customer is only allowed to purchase one photo at a time.

SK0601,1,...And that concludes the briefing on yesterday's battle.
SK0601,2,At any rate, the Black Demons have been pretty active as of late.
SK0601,3,Yes, we've already deployed three times in the past two weeks.
SK0601,4,The Black Demon Society... Just what is it they're after?
SK0601,5,They're not so tough, so long as we all stick together! Right, Reni?
SK0601,6,...Y-Yeah.
SK0601,7,...
SK0601,8,All right, everyone, that's it for today. Dismissed.
SK0601,9,Welp, time to start rehearsing for our autumn production of "The Blue Bird", I guess.
SK0601,10,Let's go, Reni! We're the stars this time!
SK0601,11,...
SK0601,12,OK, we'll all meet up on stage after we've gotten changed. Excuse us, Ogami.
SK0601,13,Right, I should head back to my room, too.
SK0601,14,Do you have a moment, Ogami?
SK0601,15,Yes, what is it, Kaede?
SK0601,16,Actually... It's about Reni.
SK0601,17,I feel like she's been getting sloppy with her movements in combat lately.
SK0601,18,Almost like... she's hesitant about fighting.
SK0601,19,Reni? Seriously?
SK0601,20,Oh, I'm probably overthinking things. Don't worry about it.
SK0601,21,Anyway, good work today. Please excuse me.
SK0601,22,Reni...
SK0601,23,Right, now that I'm changed, what should I do next?
SK0601,24,Oh yeah, everyone's rehearsing for our autumn production, right?
SK0601,25,I'm worried about Reni. I should go check and see how she's doing.
SK0601,26,Oh, starting right away, are we?
SK0601,27,Ooh, ooh, let me see, I wanna watch a bit.
SK0601,28,Hey, Tyltyl, do you think Santa will come to our house too?
SK0601,29,...He's not coming this year. Mother's too busy and couldn't ask him to come.
SK0601,30,What?! But Reni-... Uh, Tyltyl, you know I've been a good girl all year!
SK0601,31,...There's nothing we can do. However, he's apparently still coming to the rich peoples' houses.
SK0601,32,This is "The Blue Bird", right? They're both really getting into their roles.
SK0601,33,Reni as Tyltyl and Iris as Mytyl are both perfect!
SK0601,34,Oh, looks like it's time for the fight scene in the forest.
SK0601,35,Leave this place, children! I, the Forest King, shall not allow you to pass!
SK0601,36,Tyltyl, I'm scared...
SK0601,37,It's all right, Mytyl, there's nothing to be afraid of. Just stay behind me.
SK0601,38,Come at me! I'll take you on with this knife!
SK0601,39,Tell me, boy. Why are you doing this? What are you fighting for?
SK0601,40,I'm protecting Mytyl...!<br>I'm... I'm...
SK0601,41,I'm...
SK0601,42,...Sorry, let's do that one over.
SK0601,43,What's wrong, Reni? Did you forget your lines? It's this one, right here!
SK0601,44,...
SK0601,45,All right, let's try once more, right where we left off.
SK0601,46,Oh my, I guess Reni really is human after all. Ohohoho.
SK0601,47,I can't believe Reni would flub her line like that.
SK0601,48,Reni...
SK0601,49,Encourage Reni.
SK0601,50,Talk with Sakura and the others.
SK0601,51,Everyone makes mistakes, Reni, don't worry about it.
SK0601,52,Heh, that's our Boss, considerate as always! Don't worry 'bout it, Reni!
SK0601,53,Goodness, Kanna, if you bellow at her like that, you'll only discourage her!
SK0601,54,High-level actors don't NEED encouragement!
SK0601,55,Hmmm, really?
SK0601,56,Shh! Quiet! The scene's starting again!
SK0601,57,Seriously, what's wrong with Reni?
SK0601,58,She's started acting strangely once they reached this scene.
SK0601,59,You'd think a fight scene like this would be no problem for her...
SK0601,60,Shh! They're starting that last scene again.
SK0601,61,C'mon, Boss, shouldn't you say something to Reni?
SK0601,62,No. I'm not very knowledgeable about theater, and I wouldn't want to distract her.
SK0601,63,My, Ensign, aren't you considerate?
SK0601,64,You made the right call. Reni doesn't need any encouraging.
SK0601,65,Shh! Quiet! The scene's starting again!
SK0601,66,Come at me! I'll take you on with this knife!
SK0601,67,Tell me, boy. Why are you doing this? What are you fighting for?
SK0601,68,I'm...
SK0601,69,...
SK0601,70,...Reni?
SK0601,71,I can't concentrate...
SK0601,72,Reni...
SK0601,73,Sorry...
SK0601,74,Oh well. Let's just take a break for now.
SK0601,75,What's wrong, Reni? You've been acting weird.
SK0601,76,...
SK0601,77,Did something happen? Tell me.
SK0601,78,...
SK0601,79,The role's not coming to me...
SK0601,80,Huh?
SK0601,81,...
SK0601,82,Sorry... I need to be alone for a while...
SK0601,83,Ah! Reni!!
SK0601,84,R-Reni? Are you all right?
SK0601,85,Reni's acting strangely. I think she might be broken!
SK0601,86,...
SK0601,87,Aw jeez, she's gone. Oh well...
SK0601,88,Reni's in no shape to be rehearsing.
SK0601,89,Reni...
SK0601,90,It's just like Kaede said. Something's up with Reni.
SK0601,91,I'll try talking to her a bit. She might be back in her room by now.
SK0601,92,Tell me some gossip.
SK0601,93,I'll come back later.
SK0601,94,Oh yeah, Ogami, have you met Tsubomi, our new shopkeep, yet?
SK0601,95,Yeah, I just ran into her. She, uh, sure seems lively.
SK0601,96,Yes, she seems overjoyed to be working here.
SK0601,97,We have to be on our best behavior with a new girl on the team, too!
SK0601,98,By the way, Ogami, I have a huge scoop.
SK0601,99,A huge scoop, you say?
SK0601,100,Uh huh! It's Tsubaki's number while she's out on her secret assignment!
SK0601,101,H-Huh?! You know her number?
SK0601,102,Yes, she has a transceiver on hand in case of emergency.
SK0601,103,Ready, Ogami? Her number is: 13600.
SK0601,104,13600... Got it. There, it's written down now.
SK0601,105,You better call her now after I went through all the trouble of getting it for you!
SK0601,106,Yeah, of course. I'll call her.
SK0601,107,Oh, I already found out myself. 13600, right?
SK0601,108,By yourself?! Wow, Ogami, you sure don't waste any time, do you?
SK0601,109,Wh-What's that supposed to mean?
SK0601,110,Hm hm, I'm sure Tsubaki was quite surprised to receive a call from you out of the blue, too.
SK0601,111,By the way, just where is Tsubaki, anyway?
SK0601,112,Heehee, about that...
SK0601,113,Yuri! That's top-secret, remember?
SK0601,114,Huh?! But I wanna tell him! It's OK if we only tell Ogami, right?
SK0601,115,Absolutely not.
SK0601,116,We'll tell you when the time is right, Ogami, so please just bear with us.
SK0601,117,O... OK.
SK0601,118,Oh yeah, Ogami, the Rose Division just finished setting up a room downstairs!
SK0601,119,When did they find the time to do that?
SK0601,120,They have all kinds of interesting stories.
SK0601,121,You might hear some interesting rumors from them, so drop by and say hi every now and then!
SK0601,122,Oh boy, that's Yuri for you.
SK0601,123,It seems like this typhoon is hitting the Kanto region head-on. I'm worried.
SK0601,124,They're even telling everyone on the radio not to go out tonight.
SK0601,125,It's true, the scariest part of a storm like this isn't the rain, it's being hit by flying objects.
SK0601,126,Transit around the capital will come to a standstill, too.
SK0601,127,It's finally time for the autumn production to start, isn't it, Ogami.
SK0601,128,The Blue Bird", right? I'm looking forward to it as well.
SK0601,129,It's Reni's big debut, all the patrons are talking about it.
SK0601,130,Ticket preorders are selling like hotcakes, too.
SK0601,131,Really? Guess everyone's looking forward to this one.
SK0601,132,(But with Reni the way she is right now, how will it turn out?)
SK0601,133,That's right, I heard some amazing news on the radio yesterday.
SK0601,134,Oh, you mean about that steam submarine?
SK0601,135,...Steam submarine?
SK0601,136,Yes, that steam submarine that wouldn't resurface no matter what anyone tried.
SK0601,137,Apparently they pulled it out of the water with nothing but rope and manpower!
SK0601,138,Wow, really?
SK0601,139,That's the honest truth. They said so on the news.
SK0601,140,How was your vacation last month, Ogami?
SK0601,141,It got pretty crazy, but I had a lot of fun. Wish you could've come with us.
SK0601,142,*sigh* I bought a new swimsuit and everything, but I never got the chance to show it off.
SK0601,143,Oh? Didn't you swim in the underground pool while everyone was on vacation?
SK0601,144,Yeah, but that's just our pool. I'm not gonna find any cute boys to swim with there.
SK0601,145,Sorry, Ogami, but I'm all out of gossip for now.
SK0601,146,I'll have some more interesting tidbits for you another time, so look forward to it!
SK0601,147,I'll be back. Good luck with the rest of your work.
SK0601,148,OK. Thanks for coming, Ogami.

SK0602,78,Oh, that time already?
SK0602,79,I should go to Reni's room. I have to try talking to her.
SK0602,80,Reni, it's me. I just want to talk for a minute. Will you open up?
SK0602,81,...
SK0602,82,Oh, hello! Pleased to meet you!
SK0602,83,By any chance, are you... Mr. Ichiro Ogami? I knew it! It really IS you!
SK0602,84,Huh?! Wh-Who are you?
SK0602,85,Starting today, I'll be running the theater's gift shop.
SK0602,86,Tsubomi Nonomura, age 15.
SK0602,87,Ahh, I can't believe I get to work at THE Imperial Theater! It's like a dream come true!
SK0602,88,Huh?! You're running the gift shop?
SK0602,89,I see, so you must be the replacement Tsubaki was talking about.
SK0602,90,Yep, that's me! A hard worker who always wears a smile-smile!
SK0602,91,Looking forward to working with you!
SK0602,92,Let's do our best.
SK0602,93,Smile-smile right back atcha!
SK0602,94,I look forward to working with you. As fellow employees of the Imperial Theater, let's both do our best.
SK0602,95,Yes, sir!
SK0602,96,I'm a bit of a scatterbrain, so I tend to mess up a lot...
SK0602,97,But I always do my utmost best with a smile-smile! I hope you'll support me!
SK0602,98,Hahaha, you're a funny one.
SK0602,99,Smile-smile right back atcha!
SK0602,100,Huh... You sure talk funny, Mr. Ogami!
SK0602,101,R-Really? I was just trying to copy you...
SK0602,102,...
SK0602,103,Oh no, you've gone quiet! Does that mean you hate me?!
SK0602,104,N-No, that's not it. We just met, after all.
SK0602,105,Then I hope you get to like me a lot from now on! Smile-smile!
SK0602,106,A-Anyway, I look forward to working with you. As employees of the Imperial Theater, let's both do our best.
SK0602,107,Yes, sir. Will do!
SK0602,108,By the way, I'm sure you know this already, but we're a secret unit that fights against demonic forces.
SK0602,109,Don't ever forget what it takes to keep the capital safe.
SK0602,110,Yes, sir! I know!
SK0602,111,I might not look it, but I'm here with the Maidens' Academy's full endorsement!
SK0602,112,Maidens' Academy"?
SK0602,113,Yes, that's right. It's, well... A training school for the troupe, established by Mr. Yoneda.
SK0602,114,I see... The manager sure has a lot going on that we have no idea about, huh.
SK0602,115,Ahh, that's right! I have to report to the office!
SK0602,116,I'm already super late! I have to hurry or I'm not gonna make it! I have to go!
SK0602,117,Hey! You're going the wrong way! The office is over here! This way!
SK0602,118,Ahhh, I messed up! Thank you so much! OK, goodbye!
SK0602,119,Phew. Another colorful character's joined us...
SK0602,120,Ensign Ogami, if I could have a moment.
SK0602,121,Eep! I-It's you!
SK0602,122,Yes. The secret unit of love and beauty, the Rose Division! I am its captain, Kotone.
SK0602,123,I'm Yokihiko! Remember lil' ol' me, Ichiro?
SK0602,124,U-Um... I'm... Kikunojo. You haven't... forgotten me, have you?
SK0602,125,Did you... need something?
SK0602,126,We've just finished setting up our room in the basement. Please, stop by sometime.
SK0602,127,Apparently there's a typhoon headed towards the capital. It's gonna be pretty stormy tonight.
SK0602,128,Kanna's up in the attic right now, getting ready to reinforce the roof.
SK0602,129,That reminds me, Maria will also be heading out the door around 5:30 to buy emergency supplies.
SK0602,130,Huh. I see.
SK0602,131,But no typhoon's gonna bother us down in the basement!
SK0602,132,It's so cozy down there, you should come and play sometime, Ichiro.
SK0602,133,U-Um... We'll be waiting for you.
SK0602,134,Now then, Ensign Ogami, we must take our leave.
SK0602,135,A storm tonight, huh? Well, that's what happens when a typhoon comes around.
SK0602,136,But boy, those three are practically a typhoon themselves.
SK0602,137,Oh, Ogami...
SK0602,138,You look like you have a lot of free time on your hands, Ensign, as usual.
SK0602,139,Hey Sakura, Orihime. What are you two up to?
SK0602,140,We were actually just talking about Reni.
SK0602,141,She's been acting kind of strangely, and I was wondering what we could do to help.
SK0602,142,You're overthinking things, Sakura. It's not unusual for actors to feel nervous about their performances.
SK0602,143,And if there is a different reason, then that's a problem only Reni herself can figure out.
SK0602,144,Stop worrying and leave her alone, I say.
SK0602,145,What do you think, Ogami?
SK0602,146,I agree with Sakura.
SK0602,147,I agree with Orihime.
SK0602,148,I agree with Sakura.
SK0602,149,Helping our friends when they're nervous or troubled is what the Flower Division does.
SK0602,150,You're right. I want to be there for her.
SK0602,151,I think Orihime has a point.
SK0602,152,I'm worried about Reni, but it's true, there are some problems people can only work out on their own.
SK0602,153,See? You get it, Ensign!
SK0602,154,You can only worry so much about Reni, Sakura. Let's just leave her be.
SK0602,155,...OK.
SK0602,156,I suppose Reni might feel better by tomorrow...
SK0602,157,Hmmm, it's hard to say who's right.
SK0602,158,For now, I think I'll go talk to her.
SK0602,159,We can't even begin to help her if we don't know what's wrong with her.
SK0602,160,You're right. Thank you, Ogami.
SK0602,161,That's what I thought you'd say. You really are nosy, Ensign.
SK0602,162,OK, I have to go now. Good luck with Reni!
SK0602,163,I'll go back to my room, too, for now. Please help Reni, Ogami.
SK0602,164,Everyone's thinking about Reni...
SK0602,165,All right, I should go too. First things first, I need to talk to Reni.
SK0602,166,Rehearsals are done for today. Nobody's here.
SK0602,167,Reni's not here either. I'll go somewhere else.
SK0602,168,Oh... Mon Frère.
SK0602,169,Hey Iris. Why the long face?
SK0602,170,I'm worried about Reni...
SK0602,171,She's looked unhappy ever since the meeting earlier. What happened to her?
SK0602,172,Iris...
SK0602,173,Cheer her up.
SK0602,174,Say nothing and pet her head.
SK0602,175,Cheer up, Iris. If Reni saw you down in the dumps like this, she'd be the one worrying instead.
SK0602,176,I'll try talking to her, OK?
SK0602,177,...You will?
SK0602,178,Yeah, I will. You have nothing to worry about.
SK0602,179,...O-OK!
SK0602,180,Thank you, Mon Frère! I feel a little better now.
SK0602,181,Iris...
SK0602,182,Ah! Mon Frère...
SK0602,183,You don't have to worry about Reni. I'll go talk to her.
SK0602,184,Come on, cheer up. First thing you have to do is cheer up, OK?
SK0602,185,...O-OK!
SK0602,186,Thanks, Mon Frère. You're so nice...
SK0602,187,Hmm... I don't know, so I can't say for sure.
SK0602,188,For now, though, I'll try talking to her.
SK0602,189,...OK. Thank you, Mon Frère.
SK0602,190,Wait, I know! I just got a great idea!
SK0602,191,Thanks, Mon Frère! I'm gonna go to the courtyard, OK?
SK0602,192,The courtyard? What for?
SK0602,193,Ehehehe, that's a secret! See you later, Mon Frère! Bye-bye!
SK0602,194,Hahaha, she's finally back to her normal self.
SK0602,195,But what's she planning on doing in the courtyard, anyway?
SK0602,196,Oh? Iris is here.
SK0602,197,Heeeey, Iris!
SK0602,198,Ah, Mon Frère!
SK0602,199,Arf, arf!
SK0602,200,Hahaha,
SK0602,201,[dog] is with you, too, I see.
SK0602,202,By the way, Iris, what were you doing just now?
SK0602,203,Eheheh! Can you guess?
SK0602,204,Something to do with the play?
SK0602,205,Something to do with Reni?
SK0602,206,Playing in the mud?
SK0602,207,Would it have something to do with the play, perhaps?
SK0602,208,Nope! It has nothing to do with the play.
SK0602,209,Huh... Then what were you doing?
SK0602,210,Would it have something to do with Reni, perhaps?
SK0602,211,Bingo! You're so smart, Mon Frère!
SK0602,212,So it's something to do with Reni, and something you have to do in the yard... Hmm, I wonder.
SK0602,213,Let's see... Playing in the mud, right?
SK0602,214,No! I'm not a little kid, you know!
SK0602,215,R-Right. Then what were you doing?
SK0602,216,Hmmm, I have no idea.
SK0602,217,I give up, Iris. Tell me what you're doing.
SK0602,218,That's. Our. Little. Secret! Isn't that right,
SK0602,219,[dog]?
SK0602,220,Woof.
SK0602,221,OK, Mon Frère, I have to get back to it, so I'll see you later.
SK0602,222,Let's go,
SK0602,223,[dog]!
SK0602,224,Arf!
SK0602,225,Ah, Iris!
SK0602,226,Sheesh. Doesn't seem like she'll tell me, no matter how many times I try to ask.
SK0602,227,Oh well, I should go. I'm worried about Reni.
SK0602,228,Iris is still at it, huh?
SK0602,229,Heeey, Iris! The wind's gotten stronger! Be careful!
SK0602,230,Okaaay!
SK0602,231,Man, whatever it is she's doing, she's sure caught up in it.
SK0602,232,Anyway, I should go somewhere else.
SK0602,233,Arf, arf!
SK0602,234,Hey,
SK0602,235,[dog]. How've you been?
SK0602,236,There's a typhoon coming tonight, so you'll have to stay inside once it gets dark out.
SK0602,237,Arf!
SK0602,238,Good answer. See you,
SK0602,239,[dog].
SK0602,240,Arf, arf!
SK0602,241,Oh, Captain.
SK0602,242,Kaede told me you were going out shopping, is that right?
SK0602,243,Yes, I'm going to get some emergency supplies to prepare for the typhoon.
SK0602,244,Going somewhere, Maria?
SK0602,245,Yes, I was on my way to go buy some candles and supplies ahead of the typhoon.
SK0602,246,Shall we go together?
SK0602,247,Be careful out there.
SK0602,248,Be careful out there. The typhoon seems like it's getting closer.
SK0602,249,Thank you, but you don't have to worry, the store's right around the corner.
SK0602,250,Well then, I'll be going.
SK0602,251,Eh, this is Maria we're talking about, she'll be fine.
SK0602,252,Now that she's gone, I should get going to another room myself.
SK0602,253,I don't have much time, so I'll be going. Excuse me.
SK0602,254,Ah, Maria! She's gone...
SK0602,255,I could've at least said, "come back safely"...
SK0602,256,Well, no use regretting that now. I'll go somewhere else.
SK0602,257,We could go together, if you don't mind.
SK0602,258,Really? I'm just going out shopping.
SK0602,259,It might be nice to take a stroll through the capital before the storm hits.
SK0602,260,Hm hm, you're right. Shall we, then?
SK0602,261,Matches... Candles... That should be everything we need.
SK0602,262,Good. Now let's make our way back to the thea--
SK0602,263,...It seems like it's started to rain.
SK0602,264,You're right. It's coming down strong, too.
SK0602,265,Let's just get out of this rain for now.
SK0602,266,Oh no. The wind is really strong now, too.
SK0602,267,I didn't bring an umbrella or anything. What should I do?
SK0602,268,We can't exactly stay here forever, either...
SK0602,269,Captain, let's try to make our way back to the theater anyway.
SK0602,270,B-But... It's so rainy and windy.
SK0602,271,I have an umbrella, albeit only one.
SK0602,272,...Well, it's true, not like we can just stay here.
SK0602,273,It's nice we get to share an umbrella, but too bad it's in such awful weather. Let's do this, Maria.
SK0602,274,Y-Yes, sir!
SK0602,275,ACHOO! We managed to make it back somehow.
SK0602,276,Are you all right, Maria?
SK0602,277,Yes. Thanks to you, Captain, I barely got wet at all.
SK0602,278,It seems like you got pretty soaked shielding me, though.
SK0602,279,Hahaha, it's nothing. Don't worry about it, Maria.
SK0602,280,Sir. Thank you.
SK0602,281,Hahaha, I can't exactly leave a lady out in the rain, can I?
SK0602,282,Captain...
SK0602,283,I'm a little wet, but I'm fine.
SK0602,284,The matches and candles stayed dry, too.
SK0602,285,Really? Then this was all worth it.
SK0602,286,I'm soaked...
SK0602,287,Half the matches and candles are ruined, too.
SK0602,288,I'm sorry, Maria. I tried my hardest, but the wind was just too strong.
SK0602,289,It's all right, sir. Don't worry about it.
SK0602,290,I know you tried your best to shield me from the rain.
SK0602,291,Thank you for saying that, Maria. I feel a little better now.
SK0602,292,I appreciate the effort, Captain. Take it easy.
SK0602,293,You too. Try not to catch a cold, OK?
SK0602,294,Thank you. Now then, I have to go.
SK0602,295,My clothes are mostly dry now, so I guess I'll get going.
SK0602,296,Maria should be back by now, right?
SK0602,297,Oh, Captain! I'm back!
SK0602,298,Welcome back, Maria. How was it out there?
SK0602,299,It started raining all of a sudden halfway through my trip.
SK0602,300,Thankfully I brought an umbrella, but the wind was so strong, I still got a little wet.
SK0602,301,I see. That must've been rough. Try not to catch a cold, OK?
SK0602,302,Thank you. Now then, I have to go.
SK0602,303,Hmm... Maybe I should've gone with her after all.
SK0602,304,Well, at least she made it home safe. That's good enough, I guess.
SK0602,305,Looks like Maria's still out. I'll check back later.
SK0602,306,Sounds like the wind's gotten a bit stronger.
SK0602,307,The typhoon's supposed to hit sometime before midnight, right? We'll have to be careful.
SK0602,308,Yo, Boss!
SK0602,309,Oh, Kanna.
SK0602,310,I've been waitin' for ya. How you feel about settling our eating contest once and for all?
SK0602,311,You're on. I'm gonna beat you this time, Kanna!
SK0602,312,Heheh, that's what I like to hear! Let's do this thing!
SK0602,313,The rules are the same as usual. Whoever eats three whole meals' worth of food first wins.
SK0602,314,Today's dish is rafute. Stewed pork cubes, kinda like kakuni, only these are from Okinawa.
SK0602,315,Right, let's get this thing started already. Begin!
SK0602,316,OK, what should I grab first?
SK0602,317,Rafute
SK0602,318,Rice
SK0602,319,Tea
SK0602,320,Rafute, huh? It really is like kakuni... Mm, delicious!
SK0602,321,Heheh, it's been stewing for three days, just for our battle today!
SK0602,322,*munch* *munch* All right, blew through that one.
SK0602,323,*munch* *munch* Mm, the rice is great too! That's one bowl down.
SK0602,324,*glug* *glug* OK, now that I've had a breather, onto the next one!
SK0602,325,Which one I should grab first? I'm not sure...
SK0602,326,What's the matter, Boss? It's our final battle! Get into it!
SK0602,327,OK, I finished the first dish. What do you think, Kanna?
SK0602,328,Heheh, we're not done yet!
SK0602,329,OK, onto meal two!
SK0602,330,Rafute...
SK0602,331,Rice...
SK0602,332,Tea...
SK0602,333,Rafute plate number 2... This is getting pretty tough.
SK0602,334,*munch* *munch*... There, done!
SK0602,335,This rice is starting to fill me up...
SK0602,336,...OK, that's bowl number two finished!
SK0602,337,Gulp... Gulp...
SK0602,338,OK, drinking some tea's helped clear out my stomach a bit. I can keep going!
SK0602,339,Hmm... This is getting difficult.
SK0602,340,What's wrong, Boss? I don't see you moving those chopsticks.
SK0602,341,There, that's two meals I've managed to finish!
SK0602,342,Not bad, Boss! Now things are really heating up!
SK0602,343,All right, meal three, last one... Here I go!
SK0602,344,Ra... Rafute!
SK0602,345,Rice!
SK0602,346,Tea!
SK0602,347,I've made it this far, I just have to power through the rest!
SK0602,348,*munch*...
SK0602,349,*munch*...
SK0602,350,*chew*...
SK0602,351,D-Done! That's all the rafute dealt with!
SK0602,352,Just five mouthfuls of rice left...
SK0602,353,Four... Three...
SK0602,354,Two... mouthfuls... Last... mouth... ful...
SK0602,355,DONE!! That's all the rice!
SK0602,356,Urgh... You got this, Ogami! This is the last one!!
SK0602,357,*glug*... *glug*... *glug*!
SK0602,358,PWAHHH!! D-Drank all the tea!
SK0602,359,Close... So close...
SK0602,360,Come on, Ogami... Just one last meal!
SK0602,361,Oh, yeah! I finished the third batch!!
SK0602,362,Huhhh?! Y-You already finished it all?!
SK0602,363,Heheh, it's our final battle. I had to get serious.
SK0602,364,Phew, I'm feeling pretty full, too.
SK0602,365,You did a hell of a job, keeping up with me like that.
SK0602,366,Guess these past three months have paid off.
SK0602,367,Not feeling good today, Boss? This ain't like you.
SK0602,368,What the hell, Boss?! You barely ate anything! Where's your drive?!
SK0602,369,I'm sorry...
SK0602,370,In the end, I still couldn't beat you, Kanna.
SK0602,371,Heh, you did a pretty good job these past three months, though.
SK0602,372,All right, I gotta go. See ya, Boss!
SK0602,373,She's right, I did pretty well to get this far.
SK0602,374,Right, I should get going. I could use a little post-meal exercise.
SK0602,375,ALL RIGHT!! That's three meals done! How do you like that, Kanna?!
SK0602,376,I just finished my third meal, too!
SK0602,377,Huh? Th-Then that means...
SK0602,378,Hahaha! Looks like it's a tie!
SK0602,379,Man, I'm stuffed... I can't move another inch...
SK0602,380,Yeah, me too... I didn't think you'd push me this far.
SK0602,381,...
SK0602,382,Boss...
SK0602,383,Hm? What's up, Kanna?
SK0602,384,Thanks for hanging out with me all these times...
SK0602,385,My birthday's coming up, you know.
SK0602,386,This was a nice memory to make before I grow a year older...
SK0602,387,Kanna...
SK0602,388,All right, Boss, I'm gonna go.
SK0602,389,In the end, I wasn't able to beat you.
SK0602,390,But you did great making it this far.
SK0602,391,Later, Boss! Let's eat together again sometime!
SK0602,392,Kanna...
SK0602,393,I'd like to try her Okinawan cooking again sometime...
SK0602,394,Kanna's... not here. Are we not having our eating contest today?
SK0602,395,Maybe I should try coming back again some time later.
SK0602,396,This dining hall's going to get really busy once our autumn production begins.
SK0602,397,Doesn't look like anyone's here. I should go.
SK0602,398,Oh, do you need something, Ogami?
SK0602,399,You're gonna listen to my gossip, right, Ogami?
SK0602,400,My, you came here like clockwork, Ogami.
SK0602,401,If you're interested in hearing more rumors, I'm all out. Sorry.
SK0602,402,I see... That's too bad.
SK0602,403,I'll have some more interesting tidbits for you another time, so look forward to it!
SK0602,404,Hello, Yuri and Kasumi.
SK0602,405,Oh, hello, Ogami. Is there something you need?
SK0602,406,I've got plenty of new, juicy gossip for you. Ask away!
SK0602,407,Oh, Mr. Ogami! Welcome!
SK0602,408,Hey, Tsubomi. Have you stopped by the office yet?
SK0602,409,Yes, I found my way there, thanks to you!
SK0602,410,While you're here, Mr. Ogami, why not buy a photo?
SK0602,411,Buy a photo.
SK0602,412,Talk to Tsubomi.
SK0602,413,Leave.
SK0602,414,Could I buy a photo?
SK0602,415,Um, Mr. Ogami? I'm afraid I can only sell you one photo at a time.
SK0602,416,We have to leave some for the customers, I hope you understand.
SK0602,417,A photo? Thank you very much!
SK0602,418,That's Sakura's photo.
SK0602,419,She looked so pretty playing Cordelia in "King Lear" this past summer...
SK0602,420,Sakura's photo? That'll be 50 sen! Thank you, come again!
SK0602,421,That's Sumire's photo.
SK0602,422,Her banter with Kanna in "King Lear" was fantastic!
SK0602,423,I couldn't stop laughing from all the way back in the stands!
SK0602,424,Sumire's photo? That'll be 50 sen! Thank you, come again!
SK0602,425,That's Maria's photo.
SK0602,426,Maria's going to be in this month's play, right? I can't wait!
SK0602,427,Maria's photo? That'll be 50 sen! Thank you, come again!
SK0602,428,That's Kanna's photo.
SK0602,429,She was so cool as King Lear!
SK0602,430,Kanna's got a lot of female fans, you know.
SK0602,431,Kanna's photo? That'll be 50 sen! Thank you, come again!
SK0602,432,That's Iris's photo.
SK0602,433,We'll finally get to see her as Mytyl this month!
SK0602,434,She's gonna be so cute! I can hardly wait!
SK0602,435,Iris's photo? That'll be 50 sen! Thank you, come again!
SK0602,436,That's Kohran's photo.
SK0602,437,She's the best when it comes to comedies!
SK0602,438,Remember that play she was in a long way back, "Dinosaur Island"? I went and saw it five times!
SK0602,439,Kohran's photo? That'll be 50 sen! Thank you, come again!
SK0602,440,That's Orihime's photo.
SK0602,441,Orihime's Imperial Theater debut as Regan in "King Lear" was great!
SK0602,442,It was a perfect performance, like you'd expect from someone who came from the birthplace of theatre!
SK0602,443,Orihime's photo? That'll be 50 sen! Thank you, come again!
SK0602,444,That's Reni's photo.
SK0602,445,With "The Blue Bird" this month, Reni finally gets to be the star!
SK0602,446,I'm SO looking forward to opening day, I just can't wait!
SK0602,447,Reni's photo? That'll be 50 sen! Thank you, come again!
SK0602,448,Oh, you're not gonna buy one?
SK0602,449,How do you like running the shop, Tsubomi?
SK0602,450,Eheheh, I messed up immediately.
SK0602,451,The very first customer I got, I forgot to take their money and had to chase after them.
SK0602,452,You forgot to take their money? Unbelievable...
SK0602,453,Eheheh, amazing, right?
SK0602,454,(I don't think that's something to be proud of.)
SK0602,455,I saw Maria heading towards the entrance just now.
SK0602,456,It looked like she was gonna go shopping or something.
SK0602,457,I've bought so many things here as a customer, and now I get to WORK here!
SK0602,458,Ahhh, this really is a dream come true! I'm gonna give it my all!
SK0602,459,Good luck punching tickets at the next show, Mr. Ogami!
SK0602,460,Well, I should be going. Keep up the good work.
SK0602,461,Thank you for your patronage! Come again!
SK0602,462,Thank you, come again! Make sure to buy a photo next time, OK?
SK0602,463,Oh, Kohran. You're a rare sight in this room.
SK0602,464,Heyyy, what was that for, Chief? I come to the music room too, sometimes!
SK0602,465,Though I didn't exactly come here to practice music today.
SK0602,466,Huh? Then what are you here for?
SK0602,467,I was just examining this piano, seeing how it makes sound.
SK0602,468,You can't really tell from the outside, though, so I'm kinda stuck.
SK0602,469,There's things even you don't know?
SK0602,470,Why not ask Orihime?
SK0602,471,How about dismantling it?
SK0602,472,I see... I guess there are some things even you don't know, huh.
SK0602,473,O-Of course there are! There's tons of stuff I don't know yet!
SK0602,474,Besides, the world would be way more boring if I knew everything.
SK0602,475,What makes you say that?
SK0602,476,Because when there's things I don't know, I get excited just thinking about them.
SK0602,477,I wanna keep looking for stuff I don't know about, so I can keep getting excited!
SK0602,478,I see... That's so like you, Kohran.
SK0602,479,Why not ask Orihime, then? She plays the piano a lot.
SK0602,480,Oh yeah! Why didn't I think of that?
SK0602,481,Thanks a bunch, Chief. I'll ask Orihime later.
SK0602,482,What if you tried dismantling it, then?
SK0602,483,D-Dismantling it? That's going overboard, Chief.
SK0602,484,...Well, there ARE tons of things I'd like to take apart.
SK0602,485,That piano looks real pricey, though, so I don't think I'd feel good about doing it.
SK0602,486,Hmm... I have no idea how pianos work, either.
SK0602,487,I see... Eh, whatever. I'm in no hurry.
SK0602,488,All right, I'm gonna go. I'll come back to give this piano a good look sometime later.
SK0602,489,OK, later, Kohran.
SK0602,490,See ya!
SK0602,491,Trying to figure out how a piano works, huh? Kohran sure is curious.
SK0602,492,OK, I should go. I wonder what the others are up to.
SK0602,493,Nobody's here. Well, rehearsals are over, after all.
SK0602,494,Oh well, I'll just go somewhere else.
SK0602,495,I wonder if Mr. Yoneda is in here. 
SK0602,496,...Yeah, I should go somewhere else.
SK0602,497,Are you in there sir? It's Ogami.
SK0602,498,Snooooore, snooooore...
SK0602,499,Sounds like he's asleep. Good grief.
SK0602,500,Oh well, guess I'll head to another room.
SK0602,501,Oh, Ogami! Come on in.
SK0602,502,Right. Pardon me.
SK0602,503,Yo, Ogami. Feel like sharing a drink?
SK0602,504,N-No, I'll pass.
SK0602,505,Right. So, what can I do you for?
SK0602,506,Ask about Tsubomi.
SK0602,507,Ask about the Rose Division.
SK0602,508,Um, about Tsubomi, the girl working the gift shop...
SK0602,509,Ah, Tsubomi Nonomura? What about her?
SK0602,510,She said she came from a "Maidens' Academy."
SK0602,511,What exactly is that?
SK0602,512,Ah, right. You don't know about that, do you, Ogami?
SK0602,513,The Maidens' Academy is a training school for Imperial Assault Troupe recruits.
SK0602,514,A training school? For the troupe?
SK0602,515,Yep. With demon attacks as frequent as they are, the Flower Division will hit their limit sooner or later.
SK0602,516,We train young girls to be the next generation of the Flower Division, both on stage and on the battlefield.
SK0602,517,To this day, though, we have yet to find pilots more suitable for the program than young girls...
SK0602,518,Even though I understand the reality of the situation, I still can't help but feel guilty about it...
SK0602,519,...I see.
SK0602,520,About the Rose Division... Just who are they, anyway?
SK0602,521,Ah, those guys? Despite all appearances, they're soldiers of the Imperial Army.
SK0602,522,Huh?! I don't believe it...
SK0602,523,It's the truth. Well, their unique personalities got them expelled from the Army...
SK0602,524,But they apparently wanted to come here anyway, so I let 'em.
SK0602,525,But they're calling themselves a division of the Imperial Assault Troupe...
SK0602,526,They just made that up. Formally, there is no such thing as the Rose Division.
SK0602,527,But really, who cares? Let 'em call themselves whatever they want.
SK0602,528,O-OK... If you say so, sir...
SK0602,529,Right then, if you don't have any more questions, you should probably get going, Ogami.
SK0602,530,You've got stuff you need to take care of, right?
SK0602,531,Y-Yes, sir... Reni's been acting strange lately, so I thought I'd go talk to her.
SK0602,532,Good. Now I can drink my sake with peace of mind, knowing you're on top of it.
SK0602,533,R-Right... I'll be going, now.
SK0602,534,There's so much that goes on without me knowing about it, huh...
SK0602,535,Well, no use thinking about that right now. I should go.
SK0602,536,Oh, Ogami.
SK0602,537,Saki? What are you doing here?
SK0602,538,Oh, nothing. Just taking a walk.
SK0602,539,Actually, this is where we first met, isn't it?
SK0602,540,Now that you mention it, you're right.
SK0602,541,Heehee... Time really flies, doesn't it?
SK0602,542,Well then, I'd better get going. Farewell, Ogami.
SK0602,543,Saki... What's with her today?
SK0602,544,No use mulling it over. I should go.
SK0602,545,We're between performances, so nobody's here.
SK0602,546,I should go. I don't have a lot of time to waste.
SK0602,547,It's just about dinnertime. What's on the menu tonight?
SK0602,548,...No, now's not the time to be thinking about that. I should go.
SK0602,549,Nobody's here. The others all seem to be elsewhere.
SK0602,550,The costumes here will see a lot of action in the fall production.
SK0602,551,But I'm worried about who's gonna be in the costume: Reni...
SK0602,552,Hmmm... Nobody's here, eh?
SK0602,553,Oh well. Guess I'll go somewhere else.
SK0602,554,The Blue Bird" takes place in a whimsical, dreamlike world.
SK0602,555,These sets and props help breathe life into that world.
SK0602,556,Thought I'd take the time to come here, but unfortunately, nobody's here.
SK0602,557,I'd just watched the rehearsal from right here, right?
SK0602,558,Rehearsal's over for today, so no one's here. Oh well, I'll just go.
SK0602,559,Nobody's here. I'll check another room.
SK0602,560,Everyone was here for rehearsal not that long ago...
SK0602,561,Why did Reni freeze up like that?
SK0602,562,Our autumn production will finally open this month.
SK0602,563,I'll have to get some ticket-punching practice in before then.
SK0602,564,King Lear was such a hit last summer, it was standing room only.
SK0602,565,I hope our fall production draws a big crowd, too.
SK0602,566,Doesn't look like any of the others are here.
SK0602,567,Oh well. Guess I'll go somewhere else.
SK0602,568,I'll have to get some ticket-punching practice in to prepare for the fall production.
SK0602,569,"The Blue Bird", huh? I hope we'll get a lot of people to come see it.
SK0602,570,Nobody here in the lobby.
SK0602,571,Oh well, better go somewhere else.
SK0602,572,Huh? The door's open.
SK0602,573,Is Sakura in there?
SK0602,574,The door's still open.
SK0602,575,Is Sakura in there?
SK0602,576,Take a quick peek inside.
SK0602,577,Leave.
SK0602,578,Well, I AM curious... I should take a look real quick.
SK0602,579,No, I shouldn't just barge into people's rooms uninvited.
SK0602,580,I'll go somewhere else... This is really gonna bug me, though.
SK0602,581,Pass this through here, then do this over here...
SK0602,582,Heehee, I think I'm about halfway done now!
SK0602,583,I hope Ogami will like it...
SK0602,584,Hmm? What about me?
SK0602,585,Now I'm curious. I should take a look real quick.
SK0602,586,Do this over here, and then...
SK0602,587,Hey, Sakura, what are you up to?
SK0602,588,Huh?! O-Ogami!!
SK0602,589,Oh, s-sorry, I just saw your door was open, thought I'd take a look.
SK0602,590,Oh... I see.
SK0602,591,...
SK0602,592,...
SK0602,593,Sakura, are you holding something behind your back?
SK0602,594,Huh? N-No, not really...
SK0602,595,Well now I'm really curious. Let me see.
SK0602,596,O-Ogami! Absolutely not!!
SK0602,597,Whoa whoa whoa whoa! You don't have to chase me out.
SK0602,598,Sorry, Ogami.
SK0602,599,What in the world are you doing in there, Sakura?
SK0602,600,Heehee, that's a secret! Now please excuse me.
SK0602,601,Hmm, what could it be? This is gonna bug me...
SK0602,602,Doesn't seem like she'll tell me, no matter how much I ask. I guess I'll drop it for now.
SK0602,603,Hey, Sakura, about earlier...
SK0602,604,I can't tell you yet, Ogami.
SK0602,605,Sorry, but I'm quite busy right now.
SK0602,606,Sakura...
SK0602,607,Oh well. Guess I'll go.
SK0602,608,I'm curious about whatever it is Sakura's up to...
SK0602,609,But I don't think she's going to tell me anything. I should just drop it and leave.
SK0602,610,Is Sakura in her room?
SK0602,611,She did just say earlier she was going to read the script over...
SK0602,612,I don't want to bother her, so I won't say anything.
SK0602,613,...Yes?
SK0602,614,It's Ogami. May I come in, Sakura?
SK0602,615,...Sure. Door's open.
SK0602,616,Pardon the intrusion, then.
SK0602,617,What's wrong, Sakura? Why the long face?
SK0602,618,...
SK0602,619,Um... There's a typhoon coming tonight, right?
SK0602,620,I was wondering if maybe there'd be lightning, too...
SK0602,621,Oh, right. You're afraid of lightning, aren't you.
SK0602,622,I've gotten over it, for the most part, but... I'm still a little scared.
SK0602,623,Ahahahaha!
SK0602,624,It's all right, I'm here for you.
SK0602,625,Ahahahaha!
SK0602,626,It's all right, I'm here for you.
SK0602,627,Want me to check in on you tonight?
SK0602,628,Ahahahaha! Right, it's gonna be pretty stormy tonight.
SK0602,629,Still, I didn't think you were still scared of lightning.
SK0602,630,So what if I am still scared?!
SK0602,631,I can't easily get over something that's terrified me since childhood!
SK0602,632,Oh... S-Sorry, I spoke too much.
SK0602,633,O-Ogami... You don't have to tease me like that.
SK0602,634,Oh... Sorry.
SK0602,635,Whatever! I bet you must think I'm weird, don't you!
SK0602,636,Now, I have to read my lines, so please leave me alone.
SK0602,637,R-Right. I'll be going, then.
SK0602,638,*sigh* Boy, I sure made her upset.
SK0602,639,Oh well, can't dwell on it too long. Guess I'll just go somewhere else.
SK0602,640,It's all right, Sakura. I'm here for you.
SK0602,641,Worst comes to worst, I'll hold you so the thunder god doesn't take you away. Just like last time.
SK0602,642,Jeez, Ogami...
SK0602,643,Heehee, thinking about that moment makes me feel kind of calm.
SK0602,644,Thank you, Ogami.
SK0602,645,Ogami... Thank you.
SK0602,646,I feel a little better now.
SK0602,647,Worrying about the lightning was getting in the way of my line reading.
SK0602,648,Now I can finally calm down and get it done.
SK0602,649,Glad I could help. All right, I should get going now.
SK0602,650,OK. Thank you.
SK0602,651,Lightning, huh? She's right, it's going to get pretty stormy tonight.
SK0602,652,Right, guess I'll go check a different room now.
SK0602,653,If it's all right with you, maybe I could come check in on you tonight?
SK0602,654,Really? I don't want to impose...
SK0602,655,It's all right, I'll be doing my rounds on the night watch anyway.
SK0602,656,Thank you. In that case, I'd appreciate it.
SK0602,657,Worrying about the lightning was getting in the way of my line reading.
SK0602,658,Now I think I can finally concentrate on it.
SK0602,659,Glad I could help. All right, I should get going now.
SK0602,660,OK. Thank you.
SK0602,661,I'll have to remember to come by tonight.
SK0602,662,Right then, I should go somewhere else.
SK0602,663,...You must think I'm weird, don't you, Ogami?
SK0602,664,N-No, of course not.
SK0602,665,It's all right, Sakura, I'm sure there won't be any lightning tonight.
SK0602,666,...
SK0602,667,I'm still a little nervous, but I'll try to take my mind off it by going over my lines.
SK0602,668,I see. Well then, I should get going.
SK0602,669,OK. Thank you.
SK0602,670,Hmmm... I wonder if we'll get any lightning tonight?
SK0602,671,No use wasting time thinking about it. I should go to another room.
SK0602,672,It's just like Sakura to have a cute nameplate like this.
SK0602,673,Let's go check another room.
SK0602,674,Yo, is that you, Boss?
SK0602,675,Fixing up the roof, right? Kaede told me.
SK0602,676,Yep. There's a typhoon headed our way, so I figured now's the time to patch up the roof.
SK0602,677,I don't see you here too often, Kanna. What are you up to?
SK0602,678,There's a typhoon headed our way, so I figured now's the time to patch up the roof.
SK0602,679,Basically, I'm gonna climb up on the roof and do a little carpentry.
SK0602,680,You're so reliable.
SK0602,681,You're handier than I thought.
SK0602,682,You, climbing up on the roof?
SK0602,683,You're so reliable.
SK0602,684,You're handier than I thought.
SK0602,685,Sure you won't break the roof?
SK0602,686,You're so reliable. We can all rest easy leaving the job to you.
SK0602,687,Thanks, Boss. You can leave it all to me!
SK0602,688,You, doing carpentry? You're handier than I thought.
SK0602,689,D-Don't be silly, I'm not handy. All I'm gonna be doing is pounding nails with a hammer, hahaha.
SK0602,690,You, climbing up on the roof?
SK0602,691,Yeah, and? Somethin' weird about that?
SK0602,692,You don't think I'm gonna stomp around and break the roof, do you?
SK0602,693,N-Nobody said anything about that!
SK0602,694,I'm kidding, relax. Well, wouldn't be too surprising if it happened, anyway. Ahahahaha!
SK0602,695,You, climbing up on the roof? Sure you won't break it instead?
SK0602,696,Tsch. That's mean, Boss. You didn't have to say that.
SK0602,697,Oh... S-Sorry, I guess I took that joke a little too far.
SK0602,698,What's up, Boss? Is it really that weird for me to be doing carpentry?
SK0602,699,N-No, that's not it at all...
SK0602,700,I grew up in Okinawa, so I'm used to typhoons.
SK0602,701,Fixing a roof like this is a piece of cake for me.
SK0602,702,I see...
SK0602,703,Hey, I know! Wanna help me out, Boss?
SK0602,704,This job would get done a lot faster if ya helped me out.
SK0602,705,Sure, I'll help!
SK0602,706,I'm busy right now.
SK0602,707,I'm not good with heights...
SK0602,708,Sure, I'll help! We've got this, Kanna!
SK0602,709,That's my Boss! Good answer!
SK0602,710,OK, let's not waste anymore time...
SK0602,711,...is what I'd like to say. This theater's huge, so it's gonna be a hassle getting up to the roof.
SK0602,712,We'll have to climb through the attic to get to the exit leading up there.
SK0602,713,I see. We'll be in big trouble if we fall.
SK0602,714,Exactly. Watch your step. Right, let's do this!!
SK0602,715,I'd love to help out, but... I'm busy right now.
SK0602,716,Tsch. That's cold, Boss.
SK0602,717,Oh well, if you're busy, you're busy. I'll take care of this myself.
SK0602,718,Sorry, Kanna. Try not to get hurt, OK?
SK0602,719,Of course, thanks! Later, Boss.
SK0602,720,Fixing the roof means we have to... climb on top of it, right?
SK0602,721,I'm... not good with heights.
SK0602,722,Ahahahaha! What are you talking about? You ride on the Soaring Whale all the time!
SK0602,723,Let's make our way up to the roof through the attic.
SK0602,724,You can get a hell of a view of the capital from up on the theater's roof. C'mon, let's go!
SK0602,725,K-Kanna! Hold on a second!!
SK0602,726,Hmmm... I don't know.
SK0602,727,C'mon, Boss. You can get a hell of a view of the capital from up on the theater's roof.
SK0602,728,True... All right, sure. I'll help.
SK0602,729,That's what I'm talkin' about! All right, let's make our way up to the roof through the attic.
SK0602,730,Remember to watch your step. Let's go, Boss!
SK0602,731,Yahoo! We're here, Boss!
SK0602,732,The view's awesome, the breeze is refreshing... This is great!
SK0602,733,I thought getting up here would be way harder, but that took no time at all!
SK0602,734,All that Navy training must be how you were able to clear that with such skill.
SK0602,735,We made it! Nice job, Boss.
SK0602,736,Man, getting up here was a real pain... Nice job, Boss.
SK0602,737,Wh-Whatever, Kanna... Let's just hurry up and get this roof fixed!
SK0602,738,Oh yeah, you're bad with heights, huh? My bad.
SK0602,739,All right, let's get this done, then.
SK0602,740,You were right, Kanna. It feels great up here. I'm glad I came.
SK0602,741,Heheh, right? I'm glad you like it.
SK0602,742,All right then, let's get this roof fixed!
SK0602,743,Thanks, Boss. You were a huge help up there.
SK0602,744,With the roof properly patched up, we can face any ol' typhoon.
SK0602,745,I'm glad I could be of help.
SK0602,746,Right then, I'm gonna go. Later, Boss.
SK0602,747,Phew... That was a lot of work.
SK0602,748,Oh yeah, by the way, don't forget our eating contest. It's time to settle things once and for all!
SK0602,749,I'll be waiting for ya in the dining hall starting from half past five. See ya!
SK0602,750,Hmm, guess that means it's time for our final battle. That was a good way to work up an appetite, then!
SK0602,751,Well, I should get going too. Where to next?
SK0602,752,No one's here...
SK0602,753,I wonder where everyone's at? I'll go somewhere else.
SK0602,754,Oh, is that you, Maria? Mind teaching me some more about billiards?
SK0602,755,Yes, that's what I was waiting here for.
SK0602,756,Right, let's not waste any time, then.
SK0602,757,By the way, sir, about Reni...
SK0602,758,Even before rehearsal just now, Reni's been acting strangely for a while.
SK0602,759,So you noticed too, huh? I figured you would.
SK0602,760,That girl... She sort of reminds me of how I used to be.
SK0602,761,Back when all I ever did was fight... When I was unable to trust others.
SK0602,762,Maria...
SK0602,763,...Right, now it's your turn. It's make or break. What will you do?
SK0602,764,Go for it.
SK0602,765,Don't risk it.
SK0602,766,OK, this one decides it all. It might be risky, but I have to go for it!
SK0602,767,*sigh* I didn't make it.
SK0602,768,Hm hm hm, now it's my turn.
SK0602,769,*sigh* Guess I lose. If only I made that last shot...
SK0602,770,You couldn't make it now, but I know you'll be able to someday, Captain.
SK0602,771,Just like with Reni. I know you'll make it through to her someday.
SK0602,772,Maria...
SK0602,773,I won't risk it. My chance will come if I just wait.
SK0602,774,Indeed. Sometimes waiting is the best option.
SK0602,775,It's just like us with Reni. We need to wait until she's ready to open up to us.
SK0602,776,I believe that day will come. I'm sure of it.
SK0602,777,Maria...
SK0602,778,Hmmm... I don't know.
SK0602,779,Captain, there are times when you need to cast your doubts aside and move forward.
SK0602,780,It's just like with Reni, you won't be able to get through to her without a strong resolve.
SK0602,781,Maria...
SK0602,782,Lost by a hair...
SK0602,783,But you've definitely gotten better, compared to last month.
SK0602,784,At this rate, you'll be able to beat me soon.
SK0602,785,Thank you, Maria. Care to join me again next time?
SK0602,786,Yes, with pleasure.
SK0602,787,Now then, I have to take care of something, so I'll be going.
SK0602,788,Will the day truly come when I can beat Maria?
SK0602,789,Hearing her say that does fill me with confidence, though.
SK0602,790,Maria's not here. I was hoping we could play some more billiards...
SK0602,791,But I guess I came too late.
SK0602,792,No one's here...
SK0602,793,Oh well. I'll go somewhere else.
SK0602,794,Is that you, Maria? Were you looking for a book?
SK0602,795,Yes, sir. I was looking for "The Blue Bird" by Maeterlinck.
SK0602,796,I was thinking about reading it for reference for our play.
SK0602,797,Tyltyl and Mytyl, together on a marvelous journey to find the blue bird...
SK0602,798,Captain, do you know what the blue bird they're searching for represents?
SK0602,799,Eternal life.
SK0602,800,Happiness.
SK0602,801,Money.
SK0602,802,I'm pretty sure it's eternal life.
SK0602,803,...Wrong. The blue bird in this work represents happiness.
SK0602,804,O-Oh... Is that so...
SK0602,805,Don't pretend to know what you don't know, sir.
SK0602,806,I'm pretty sure it's happiness.
SK0602,807,Precisely. Impressive, sir. You're quite knowledgeable.
SK0602,808,I'm pretty sure it's money.
SK0602,809,...Wrong. The blue bird in this work represents happiness.
SK0602,810,O-Oh... Is that so...
SK0602,811,Don't pretend to know what you don't know, sir.
SK0602,812,Hmmm, I have no idea.
SK0602,813,Hm hm hm, that could also be the right answer, in a sense.
SK0602,814,In the play, the blue bird is written to represent happiness.
SK0602,815,But what happiness means, well... That depends from person to person.
SK0602,816,The blue bird that Reni and Iris are after...
SK0602,817,What do you suppose it means to them?
SK0602,818,Maria...
SK0602,819,Forgive me, I'm just rambling.
SK0602,820,Now then, there's something I need to take care of. Excuse me, sir.
SK0602,821,I'll be around to play billiards until 5:30.
SK0602,822,The blue bird, huh...?
SK0602,823,Well, I'd better get going.
SK0602,824,It's fall already. The perfect season for reading.
SK0602,825,I can wait till nighttime to read, though. I should go somewhere else.
SK0602,826,Ensign...
SK0602,827,Oh, Sumire.
SK0602,828,I've been waiting for you, Ensign. I will teach you how to properly serve tea once again this month.
SK0602,829,OK, let's start our lesson, then.
SK0602,830,So, I've just finished steeping these tea leaves.
SK0602,831,Would you be so kind as to pour me a cup, Ensign?
SK0602,832,Pour it quickly.
SK0602,833,Pour it slowly.
SK0602,834,Pour it out to the last drop.
SK0602,835,(All right, let's try pouring this out quickly!)
SK0602,836,Ow, hot hot hot! Crap, it spilled!
SK0602,837,For goodness' sake, Ensign! That's far too fast.
SK0602,838,Black tea must be poured out gradually to the last drop.
SK0602,839,That final drop is what we call the "Golden Drop."
SK0602,840,That is because it is even more highly concentrated with delicious tea.
SK0602,841,I-I see... How educational.
SK0602,842,(OK, I'll pour it out carefully to the very last drop)
SK0602,843,...
SK0602,844,Ensign, that is much too slow.
SK0602,845,If you pour it out that slowly, the tea will be far too bitter by the end.
SK0602,846,R-Really?
SK0602,847,When it comes to serving tea, you must be neither quick nor slow...
SK0602,848,Pour it gradually to the very last drop.
SK0602,849,That final drop is what we call the "Golden Drop."
SK0602,850,That is because it has the highest concentration of delicious tea extract.
SK0602,851,I-I see... How educational.
SK0602,852,(OK, I'll pour it out gradually to the very last drop.)
SK0602,853,...
SK0602,854,OK, I'm done pouring. How was that, Sumire?
SK0602,855,Splendid, Ensign. Your pouring technique was impressive.
SK0602,856,That last drop is what we call the "Golden Drop."
SK0602,857,That is because it has the highest concentration of delicious tea extract.
SK0602,858,You've learned quite well, Ensign.
SK0602,859,Hahaha, thanks.
SK0602,860,Do hurry up, Ensign!
SK0602,861,If you take too long, the tea will become bitter!
SK0602,862,R-Really?
SK0602,863,When it comes to serving tea, you must be neither quick nor slow...
SK0602,864,Pour it gradually to the very last drop.
SK0602,865,That final drop is what we call the "Golden Drop."
SK0602,866,That is because it has the highest concentration of delicious tea extract.
SK0602,867,I-I see... How educational.
SK0602,868,That's enough, Ensign. Let's stop here for this month.
SK0602,869,Thank you, Sumire. That was quite educational.
SK0602,870,I'll be waiting for you here again next month.
SK0602,871,Guess there's a proper method for every step of making tea, isn't there?
SK0602,872,Well, I've finished my tea and had a nice break. I should get going.
SK0602,873,Oh, Sumire, is that you?
SK0602,874,Oh, Ensign. Would you care to have some milk tea with me?
SK0602,875,Really? Well, since you asked so nicely, then sure, why not?
SK0602,876,Now then, I'll prepare you a delectable cup of milk tea.
SK0602,877,...
SK0602,878,Huh? You're putting in the milk first?
SK0602,879,Yes, that's right. Do you know why?
SK0602,880,To weaken the tea's flavor?
SK0602,881,So the milk doesn't curdle?
SK0602,882,Force of habit?
SK0602,883,Hmm, if I had to guess, I'd say it's to weaken the tea's strong flavor?
SK0602,884,I see. I suppose that's one way to think of it.
SK0602,885,One way"? What's the right answer, then?
SK0602,886,Ohohohoho! My apologies, Ensign, it's merely a habit of mine.
SK0602,887,If I had to give a reason, I suppose it's because it makes the milk easier to measure out.
SK0602,888,S-Seriously? Sheesh, you had me for a second, there.
SK0602,889,Hmm, if I had to guess, I'd say it's to prevent the milk from curdling?
SK0602,890,Goodness, the milk doesn't curdle, even if you pour it in after the tea.
SK0602,891,In that case, what's the right answer?
SK0602,892,Ohohohoho! My apologies, Ensign, it's merely a habit of mine.
SK0602,893,If I had to give a reason, I suppose it's because it makes the milk easier to measure out.
SK0602,894,S-Seriously? Sheesh, you had me for a second, there.
SK0602,895,If I had to guess, I'd say it's just a force of habit?
SK0602,896,My, Ensign! You're quite sharp!
SK0602,897,Indeed, it's merely a habit of mine.
SK0602,898,If I had to give a reason, I suppose it's because it makes the milk easier to measure out.
SK0602,899,I see...
SK0602,900,Actually, I'm a little embarrassed you were actually able to guess that.
SK0602,901,Hmmm, I have no idea.
SK0602,902,Well, it's only natural you wouldn't know.
SK0602,903,That's because it's merely a habit of mine!
SK0602,904,If I had to give a reason, I suppose it's because it makes the milk easier to measure out.
SK0602,905,S-Seriously? Sheesh, you had me for a second, there.
SK0602,906,Here, Ensign. Your milk tea.
SK0602,907,Thank you. Cheers.
SK0602,908,...
SK0602,909,Phew, that was delicious. Thank you.
SK0602,910,It would do you some good to enjoy a cup of tea every once in a while, Ensign.
SK0602,911,Hahaha, well, you know how busy I usually am.
SK0602,912,Right, I'll be going, then. Thanks again for the milk tea.
SK0602,913,Take care, Ensign.
SK0602,914,Looks like Sumire's still enjoying her tea.
SK0602,915,I shouldn't bother her, so I guess I'll just get going.
SK0602,916,Sumire might have another tea lesson for me. I'll come back later.
SK0602,917,Hmm... Guess no one's here.
SK0602,918,I thought I might find someone here, but I guess not. Too bad.
SK0602,919,Ah, Ensign.
SK0602,920,You told me to ask Orihime, so I went to her right away.
SK0602,921,Now I know a bunch more about pianos. Thanks a ton.
SK0602,922,There's not a thing I don't know about pianos!
SK0602,923,You're quite perceptive, Ensign.
SK0602,924,Hahaha, thanks.
SK0602,925,By the way, Chief. It's been getting pretty windy, huh?
SK0602,926,Yo, Chief. Getting kinda windy, huh?
SK0602,927,You're right. The typhoon seems to be getting closer.
SK0602,928,We don't have typhoons or anything back in Italy, so I'm looking forward to it.
SK0602,929,Oh yeah, Chief, you know where the word "typhoon" comes from?
SK0602,930,Japanese?
SK0602,931,Chinese?
SK0602,932,English?
SK0602,933,Huh? Is it not a Japanese word?
SK0602,934,You'd think so, but actually no.
SK0602,935,There's all kindsa theories saying it's originally Chinese or Arabic or what have you, but...
SK0602,936,...But?
SK0602,937,But the truth is, we don't actually know!
SK0602,938,H-Hey, no fair, that was a trick question!
SK0602,939,Ahaha, sorry. At least you learned something, right?
SK0602,940,Hmmm... Chinese, I guess?
SK0602,941,Oh, not a bad guess, Chief.
SK0602,942,There's all kindsa theories saying it's originally Chinese or Arabic or what have you, but...
SK0602,943,...But?
SK0602,944,But the truth is, we don't actually know!
SK0602,945,H-Hey, no fair, that was a trick question!
SK0602,946,Ahaha, sorry. At least you learned something, right?
SK0602,947,Hmmm... It's definitely English, right?
SK0602,948,Not originally. In English, "typhoon" is a loan word.
SK0602,949,There's all kindsa theories saying it's originally Chinese or Arabic or what have you, but...
SK0602,950,...But?
SK0602,951,But the truth is, we don't actually know!
SK0602,952,H-Hey, no fair, that was a trick question!
SK0602,953,Ahaha, sorry. At least you learned something, right?
SK0602,954,Hmm... Don't know.
SK0602,955,That's right! The answer is we don't know!
SK0602,956,There's all kindsa theories saying it's originally Chinese or Arabic or what have you,
SK0602,957,but the truth is, we still don't really know.
SK0602,958,Wow, I'm impressed, Ensign.
SK0602,959,Though if I didn't know any better, it almost sounded like you didn't actually know...
SK0602,960,All right, Orihime, let's split.
SK0602,961,Sure. We have to get going, Ensign. See you later.
SK0602,962,I'll be working on the Koubu later tonight, Chief, so stop by if ya got time.
SK0602,963,All right, gotta go. See ya.
SK0602,964,The wind's gotten stronger. I should get going, too.
SK0602,965,The weather's still nice out, but the wind's getting stronger and stronger.
SK0602,966,No use sticking around here. I should go.
SK0602,967,I wonder if Kaede's in her room?
SK0602,968,...Yeah, I should go somewhere else.
SK0602,969,It's Ogami. Are you there, Kaede?
SK0602,970,Oh, Ogami. The door's unlocked, come in.
SK0602,971,Right. Pardon me.
SK0602,972,Hi, Ogami. Did you need something?
SK0602,973,Have a chat.
SK0602,974,Ask about Ayame.
SK0602,975,Nothing in particular.
SK0602,976,It's gotten quite windy out, hasn't it?
SK0602,977,Yes it has. Looks like everyone's getting ready for the typhoon tonight.
SK0602,978,Kanna said she was going to fix the roof while there's still time, so I think she might be in the attic.
SK0602,979,Maria said she was going to go out to buy some emergency supplies, so you might find her by the entrance.
SK0602,980,I see. Sounds like everyone's working hard.
SK0602,981,I would like to hear about Ayame... If that's OK with you.
SK0602,982,Why of course. Hmm. What should I talk about?
SK0602,983,No... Nothing in particular.
SK0602,984,Oh, really? Hm hm, you really are an odd one, Ogami.
SK0602,985,Well then, I have to excuse myself.
SK0602,986,You're always welcome here.
SK0602,987,All right. Well, I should get going. Please excuse me.
SK0602,988,I'm glad I could talk with you, Kaede. I'll drop by again when I've got time.
SK0602,989,It's Ogami. Are you there, Kaede?
SK0602,990,Ah, Ogami?
SK0602,991,I'm sorry, but I have to write these reports.
SK0602,992,I see. Then I'll see you later.
SK0602,993,Sorry, Ogami. Let's have a nice talk some time later.
SK0602,994,Oh, Ogami.
SK0602,995,Saki? What are you doing here?
SK0602,996,...
SK0602,997,The Flower Division, they all work as actresses on that stage.
SK0602,998,Some actresses, however, you'll never find up on a stage.
SK0602,999,What's that supposed to mean?
SK0602,1000,Yes, whatever could it mean?
SK0602,1001,Well then, I'd better get going. Farewell, Ogami.
SK0602,1002,Saki... What was that all about?
SK0602,1003,No use mulling it over. I should go.
SK0602,1004,The seats are empty if there's no show going on.
SK0602,1005,There's no use staying here. I should go somewhere else.
SK0602,1006,Phew... Nothing like being in my own room to calm me down.
SK0602,1007,Now, what should I do...
SK0602,1008,Call someone.
SK0602,1009,Maybe next time.
SK0602,1010,I know, why don't I make a call?
SK0602,1011,Reni, it's me. I just want to talk for a minute. Will you open up?
SK0602,1012,...
SK0602,1013,I'll try later. I still have other stuff to do.
SK0602,1014,This place will be packed full of guests once we begin our fall production.
SK0602,1015,Nobody's here now, though. Guess I'll go elsewhere.
SK0602,1016,Maria? Are you there?
SK0602,1017,Looks like nobody's home.
SK0602,1018,It's Maria's nameplate.
SK0602,1019,If I remember right, Maria's going out shopping around 5:30...
SK0602,1020,I'll stop by the entrance later and see.
SK0602,1021,OK, time to check another room.
SK0602,1022,I wonder if Kanna is inside.
SK0602,1023,...She's not here.
SK0602,1024,Kanna's... Well, I guess it's more of a nametag than a nameplate.
SK0602,1025,OK, let's check another room.
SK0602,1026,I wonder if Sumire is inside.
SK0602,1027,Nope, not here.
SK0602,1028,This is a pretty subtle design, considering it's Sumire.
SK0602,1029,Let's check another room.
SK0602,1030,Orihime... Is she in her room?
SK0602,1031,Hmm. Guess nobody's home.
SK0602,1032,The name plate has simple design, but it sure looks high class.
SK0602,1033,Let's go check another room.
SK0602,1034,I wonder if Kohran is inside.
SK0602,1035,There's no response. Looks like she's in another room.
SK0602,1036,A gear-shaped nameplate, huh? It's just Kohran's style.
SK0602,1037,Let's check another room.
SK0602,1038,Iris... Is she inside?
SK0602,1039,No answer. Guess she's not here.
SK0602,1040,At any rate, looks like today's a day off from her studies.
SK0602,1041,So Iris's nameplate is shaped like Jean-Paul...
SK0602,1042,OK, I'll check another room.
SK0602,1043,I wonder if Reni's inside.
SK0602,1044,Reni, it's me. I just want to talk for a minute. Will you open up?
SK0602,1045,...
SK0602,1046,It's just a piece of paper from a notebook. I suppose that's fitting for someone like Reni.
SK0602,1047,OK, let's check another room.
SK0602,1048,Sumire, is that you? Didn't think I'd find you here.
SK0602,1049,I thought I'd stop by here on my way back from the stage.
SK0602,1050,If we didn't have these Koubu in our battle in Atami last month, we would've been in grave danger.
SK0602,1051,Yeah, we made it out by the skin of our teeth.
SK0602,1052,At any rate, the Black Demons somehow knew we'd be in Atami.
SK0602,1053,Don't you find that strange, Ensign?
SK0602,1054,Yeah, how did they know?
SK0602,1055,Probably a coincidence.
SK0602,1056,Maybe they came to vacation too?
SK0602,1057,Could there be a spy?
SK0602,1058,Probably a coincidence.
SK0602,1059,Maybe they came to vacation too?
SK0602,1060,You're right, how did the Black Demons get a hold of that kind of information?
SK0602,1061,...I see. So you don't have any guesses, then?
SK0602,1062,Eh, probably just a coincidence. Nothing to worry about.
SK0602,1063,This is not the time to be careless, Ensign.
SK0602,1064,If the Imperial Assault Troupe's intel is leaking out to the Black Demons, we are in serious trouble!
SK0602,1065,Y-You're right. Sorry.
SK0602,1066,For heaven's sake! You need to take this more seriously!
SK0602,1067,Well, it WAS summer, maybe they were there on vacation too?
SK0602,1068,...Ensign, while I don't dislike that particular brand of humor...
SK0602,1069,I was trying to have a serious discussion. There's a time and place for everything.
SK0602,1070,S-Sorry. Got a little carried away.
SK0602,1071,Could it be... there's a spy in our midst?
SK0602,1072,You think so too, Ensign? I was wondering the same, myself.
SK0602,1073,I discussed it with Maria just beforehand.
SK0602,1074,Well, what did she say?
SK0602,1075,She stayed quiet for a while, at first.
SK0602,1076,Then she told me not to cast doubts on anybody without evidence, that I'd be playing into the enemy's hand.
SK0602,1077,I see...
SK0602,1078,Maria's right. We can't just take shots in the dark without evidence.
SK0602,1079,Don't tell anybody else about this, OK, Sumire?
SK0602,1080,Yes, understood.
SK0602,1081,Don't stay quiet, Ensign, please say something.
SK0602,1082,OK, but... I don't really know, either.
SK0602,1083,Oh. How disappointing.
SK0602,1084,At any rate, we mustn't be careless.
SK0602,1085,Yeah, you're right, but we can't get riled up by their tricks, either.
SK0602,1086,It's important that we keep living our lives like normal.
SK0602,1087,Yes, I think so too.
SK0602,1088,Now then, I'd better get going. Take care, Ensign.
SK0602,1089,Ah, that's right, come meet me in the salon later.
SK0602,1090,We'll continue our tea brewing lesson from last time.
SK0602,1091,Sumire's gone, I should get going too.
SK0602,1092,Nobody's here. I thought I might find Kohran here, but I guess not.
SK0602,1093,Well, rehearsals are over, so she's probably going to be working on the Koubu through the night.
SK0602,1094,Huh? Looks like someone's in the bathroom.
SK0602,1095,I'm pretty sure this is what Maria was wearing earlier...
SK0602,1096,Th-Then that means... Maria's in the bath right now...
SK0602,1097,My body is moving towards the bathroom on its own...
SK0602,1098,Go back outside.
SK0602,1099,Oh no, my body is moving towards the bathroom on its own...
SK0602,1100,(Maria... She was soaking wet after that shopping trip.)
SK0602,1101,(She must've felt pretty chilly, what with it being September and all.)
SK0602,1102,(...! Uh-oh, I feel a sneeze coming on!)
SK0602,1103,Sneeze.
SK0602,1104,(C-Crap, I can't hold it in any longer!)
SK0602,1105,ACHOO!!
SK0602,1106,...!! C-Captain?!
SK0602,1107,S-Sorry Maria! It's just, I, uh...
SK0602,1108,Captain! Get out... Get out this instant!!
SK0602,1109,Y-Yes, ma'am! Right away, ma'am!
SK0602,1110,...
SK0602,1111,I'm sorry, Maria. I went in without really thinking...
SK0602,1112,What's the matter with you, peeping into the bath like that?! You're the captain!!
SK0602,1113,This is a communal living space! The least you could do is follow the bare minimum of rules and manners!
SK0602,1114,Yes, ma'am... Understood.
SK0602,1115,I'll be going now. Think about what you've done, Captain.
SK0602,1116,Man, she's furious with me... Well, it WAS my fault.
SK0602,1117,I should pull myself together and get going.
SK0602,1118,(Urgh... Mmf... I-I think I managed to suppress my sneeze.)
SK0602,1119,(N-Now's my chance to get out of here, quick!)
SK0602,1120,Phew, made it out of there alive.
SK0602,1121,If Maria had found me there, I would've been in deep trouble.
SK0602,1122,(Maria must've gotten soaked when she went out to buy supplies for everyone.)
SK0602,1123,(OK, let's head outside. I can't peep in the bath.)
SK0602,1124,All right, that's enough for now.
SK0602,1125,Take as long as you need, Maria, so you don't catch a cold.
SK0602,1126,Phew... Right, I suppose it's time I got out.
SK0602,1127,(Oh crap!! It looks like she's getting out of the water!)
SK0602,1128,(I gotta get out of here before she sees me!)
SK0602,1129,Phew, I think I got away before she realized I was there.
SK0602,1130,If I'd been just a moment slower, I might not have made it. That was too close...
SK0602,1131,Oh, Captain... Were you looking to take a bath, too?
SK0602,1132,N-No... That's not it.
SK0602,1133,I see. I just got out of the bath, myself.
SK0602,1134,There's nothing quite as refreshing as taking a hot bath after a hard day's work.
SK0602,1135,Anyway, I have to go. Take care, Captain.
SK0602,1136,It's true, nothing beats taking a bath after working hard.
SK0602,1137,I should get going. I've still got things I need to do.
SK0602,1138,Looks like no one's taking a bath right now.
SK0602,1139,I'll go to a different room. I wonder where everyone else is?
SK0602,1140,Oh, is that you, Kanna?
SK0602,1141,Oh, well if it ain't the Boss.
SK0602,1142,Even I get full sometimes, so I was just doing some light post-meal exercise.
SK0602,1143,I was just doing some light exercise to prepare for our eating contest.
SK0602,1144,I come down here to train sometimes. Daily training is important, you know.
SK0602,1145,I see. That's our Kanna.
SK0602,1146,Whenever I feel nervous about anything, I just start workin' out.
SK0602,1147,Whenever I work out, feels like the sweat washes all my worries away.
SK0602,1148,I hope Reni can get over whatever it is that's bothering her, too...
SK0602,1149,Kanna...
SK0602,1150,I know she will.
SK0602,1151,Hmm... Might be tough.
SK0602,1152,What if you coached her?
SK0602,1153,It'll be all right, Kanna. I know Reni will figure things out.
SK0602,1154,Besides, she has us to help her whenever she's in trouble.
SK0602,1155,...You're right. You always know just what to say, Boss!
SK0602,1156,Hmmm... That might be tough. Do you think Reni will really be OK?
SK0602,1157,Aw, c'mon, Boss! Don't talk like that.
SK0602,1158,Ya gotta be there for her. That's the captain's job, isn't it?
SK0602,1159,Y-You're right. I can't be saying things like that.
SK0602,1160,Well then, what if you helped train her?
SK0602,1161,No, Boss. Despite all appearances, Reni's not your average kid.
SK0602,1162,The way she's always on her guard, she seems pretty skilled already.
SK0602,1163,Now that you mention it, there was that time she threw me down to the ground like it was nothing.
SK0602,1164,She did that to YOU?! Huh... You really can't judge a book by its cover, huh?
SK0602,1165,I see... Still, I wonder when she picked up those combat skills?
SK0602,1166,Yeah... I'm definitely curious.
SK0602,1167,Don't just clam up like that, Boss.
SK0602,1168,I'm tryin' to be serious, but you're makin' me feel silly.
SK0602,1169,Ah... S-Sorry, I didn't mean to do that.
SK0602,1170,Welp, I worked up a decent sweat, so I'm gonna get goin'.
SK0602,1171,Later, Boss. Take care of Reni, all right?
SK0602,1172,Take care of Reni, huh...
SK0602,1173,Kanna's worried about Reni, in her own way.
SK0602,1174,I don't have time to work out right now.
SK0602,1175,I should go somewhere else. Where is everyone, anyway?
SK0602,1176,Wh-What is this...? And that smell... It reeks of roses...
SK0602,1177,Oh my, Ogami! Welcome!
SK0602,1178,You actually came... I'm so happy...
SK0602,1179,Come on, Ichiro, don't be shy! Come in!
SK0602,1180,S-Sure...
SK0602,1181,B-By the way, what exactly are you doing here, anyway?
SK0602,1182,Hmhmhm... Ogami, do you know what the thorns on a rose are there for?
SK0602,1183,To harm others?
SK0602,1184,To protect itself?
SK0602,1185,Just for decoration?
SK0602,1186,The thorns on a rose? They're for hurting others, right?
SK0602,1187,No, that's not it. A rose's thorns are its weapons, made to protect what's important.
SK0602,1188,The thorns on a rose? They're for protecting itself, right?
SK0602,1189,Yes, exactly. A rose's thorns are its weapons, made to protect what's important.
SK0602,1190,Hmm... Aren't they just there for decoration?
SK0602,1191,No, that's not it. A rose's thorns are its weapons, made to protect what's important.
SK0602,1192,Hmmm... No idea.
SK0602,1193,Then I'll tell you. A rose's thorns are its weapons, made to protect what's important.
SK0602,1194,Of course, what WE'RE protecting isn't ourselves.
SK0602,1195,Well then... What is it?
SK0602,1196,That's our. Little. Secret!
SK0602,1197,But never mind that, Ichiro! Stay here and play with us for a while!
SK0602,1198,N-No, I'm good, thanks! I really ought to get going now! Excuse me!
SK0602,1199,Oh, what a shame. Come back whenever you'd like.
SK0602,1200,Um... We'll be... waiting for you...
SK0602,1201,R-Right... I'll be going, now.
SK0602,1202,Phew... It feels like the smell of roses is clinging to my body.
SK0602,1203,Still, how did they set up that room so quickly...?
SK0602,1204,Oh, Ogami. What's the status up on the surface?
SK0602,1205,The typhoon's getting closer, so the wind's picking up.
SK0602,1206,It's safe and warm down here underground. Why don't you come down a play for a while?
SK0602,1207,Eep! I-I'll pass!
SK0602,1208,A-All right, I gotta go!
SK0602,1209,Ah! Ichiroooo!
SK0602,1210,Sheesh... I'm putting my life on the line every time I step into that room.
SK0602,1211,Oh, Ogami.
SK0602,1212,Saki? What are you doing here?
SK0602,1213,Oh, nothing. Just taking a walk.
SK0602,1214,I was just wondering when will this room be used again.
SK0602,1215,Perhaps... it might even be tonight.
SK0602,1216,Well then, I'd better get going. Farewell, Ogami.
SK0602,1217,Saki... What's with her today?
SK0602,1218,No use mulling it over. I should go.
SK0602,1219,That reminds me, Kaede spoke to me about Reni at the meeting earlier today.
SK0602,1220,She's been acting strangely both on stage and in battle... What's wrong with her?
SK0602,1221,I detect the faint smell of roses...
SK0602,1222,The smell of roses in a messy storeroom... It's enough to make my head spin.
SK0602,1223,Ooh, smells like soap in here. Must be because Maria just took a bath.
SK0602,1224,There's no use of standing idly by in here. Let's move to another room.
SK0602,1225,I thought someone might be taking a bath right now, but I guess not.
SK0602,1226,Oh well, I'll just go somewhere else.
SK0602,1227,Doesn't look like anybody's swimming in here...
SK0602,1228,All right, I'll check a different room.
SK0602,1229,The steam processor... An incredible machine, one of only a few in all of Japan.
SK0602,1230,We barely ever use it, so I'm sure it doesn't feel very appreciated.
SK0602,1231,Hmm... Guess no one's here.
SK0602,1232,I probably shouldn't stick around here.
SK0602,1233,OK, who to call?
SK0602,1234,Hello? This is Tsubaki Takamura.
SK0602,1235,Hey, Tsubaki? It's me, Ogami.
SK0602,1236,Huh? Ogami! How'd you get my number?
SK0602,1237,Yuri just told me.
SK0602,1238,Oh, I see! I'm just a little surprised, getting called out of the blue like this.
SK0602,1239,I just kept trying numbers till I found it.
SK0602,1240,Really? Well thanks for going through all that trouble!
SK0602,1241,OK, let's talk on the big screen!
SK0602,1242,Wow, I can see you so clearly!
SK0602,1243,Yeah, I can see you well on this end, too.
SK0602,1244,Really? This feels kind of different from our chats at the shop.
SK0602,1245,By the way, Ogami, did you need something from me?
SK0602,1246,Tell her, "good luck."
SK0602,1247,Ask what she's doing.
SK0602,1248,Ask her out on a date.
SK0602,1249,I won't ask you what you're doing, but good luck all the same, Tsubaki.
SK0602,1250,Y-Yes, sir! Thank you!
SK0602,1251,I can't tell you what I'm working on, due to the nature of this assignment...
SK0602,1252,But with you cheering me on, I know I'll do my best!
SK0602,1253,I know I've asked this before, but... what exactly are you up to?
SK0602,1254,I'm sorry. I can't tell you, not under any circumstances.
SK0602,1255,I see...
SK0602,1256,...
SK0602,1257,...All right, Ogami, how about this? I'll tell you where I am, but that's it.
SK0602,1258,Right now, I'm at the Imperial Assault Troupe's Hokkaido Headquarters.
SK0602,1259,Huh? Hokkaido?!
SK0602,1260,Yes. I can't say any more than that. Sorry.
SK0602,1261,Tsubaki, when you get back, how about we go on a date?
SK0602,1262,Huh? Are you serious, Ogami?
SK0602,1263,OK, once I get back, I'll make sure to invite you out, then!
SK0602,1264,No, nothing in particular. I just wanted to talk to you.
SK0602,1265,O-Ogami...
SK0602,1266,...
SK0602,1267,...
SK0602,1268,I... Um... I should go, got work to do, bye!
SK0602,1269,Ah! Tsubaki!
SK0602,1270,
SK0602,1271,*sigh* She hung up.
SK0602,1272,At any rate, I wonder where she is and what she's doing?
SK0602,1273,All right, Ogami, I'm in the middle of work, so I have to go.
SK0602,1274,Tell everyone at the theater I said hi!
SK0602,1275,Sure. Good luck with your work!
SK0602,1276,Thank you! Call me again sometime!
SK0602,1277,Tsubaki really is working her hardest, isn't she.
SK0602,1278,But still, I wonder what's she's doing over there?
SK0602,1279,...
SK0602,1280,Tsubaki's not picking up. She must've gotten back to work after all.
SK0602,1281,Good afternoon. This is Capital News.
SK0602,1282,Days earlier, a battle broke out between the Imperial Assault Troupe and the Black Demons at Atami.
SK0602,1283,However, the site of this battle is currently enjoying somewhat of a boom in tourism.
SK0602,1284,It's believed that the locals, who usually never get to see the troupe in action...
SK0602,1285,...are rushing to the site of their battle to do some sightseeing.
SK0602,1286,However, it is still unclear as to why the Black Demons appeared in Atami...
SK0602,1287,...nor how the Imperial Assault Troupe were able to respond and arrive so quickly.
SK0602,1288,We have with us an eyewitness from Atami to give us his side of the story.
SK0602,1289,I never would've imagined I'd ever see the Imperial Assault Troupe fight in a place like this...
SK0602,1290,Figured I'd watch while they were here. I'd always wanted to see a robot battle with my own two eyes.
SK0602,1291,Huh? Why did the Black Demons show up?
SK0602,1292,Well, they must've come here for summer vacation! Ahahahaha!
SK0602,1293,Next, concerning the revised measurement law passed on July 1st last year.
SK0602,1294,Following the enactment of the law, which adopted the metric system as the national standard...
SK0602,1295,...elementary school textbooks have been using the metric system as of this April.
SK0602,1296,However, the former "shakkanhou" system of measurement is still in wide use, both commercially and privately.
SK0602,1297,This state of chaos caused by the two systems is likely to continue for some time.
SK0602,1298,Finally, it's time for this week's weather forecast.
SK0602,1299,A large typhoon is steadily approaching the Kanto region.
SK0602,1300,A strong wind advisory has already been declared for the Tokyo metropolitan area.
SK0602,1301,The typhoon is expected to arrive in the capital from midnight through dawn.
SK0602,1302,Refrain from going outdoors tonight, and securely fasten your shutters before going to bed.
SK0602,1303,That's it for Capital News, brought to you by the Capital Daily Report.
SK0602,1304,This concludes our broadcast day. <br> Capital News, signing off.
SK0602,1305,A red shadow opposes the evildoers lurking in the darkness of the capital. His name is Masked Red!
SK0602,1306,Masked Red, the boy wonder of justice! Today he continues his fight for peace in the capital!
SK0602,1307,Serial Radio Drama Masked Red, The Terrifying Mummy, Part 5
SK0602,1308,Y-You managed to escape those hellish sewers?! You're no ordinary boy!"
SK0602,1309,Prepare yourself, Dr. Kurogane! I'm putting an end to your schemes!"
SK0602,1310,How dare you, you insolent pest! Go, Mummy! My mightiest robot!"
SK0602,1311,Blowing steam from its mouth, the mummy begins to pursue Masked Red!
SK0602,1312,I see, so that mummy was nothing more than a steam-powered contraption! In that case, take this!"
SK0602,1313,Masked Red fires his Colt and blows open a hole in the mummy's abdomen.
SK0602,1314,Water gushes forth from the hole, and before long, a hissing noise comes from the robot's body.
SK0602,1315,You fool! You're going to make its boiler explode!"
SK0602,1316,Indeed, the mummy explodes, taking Dr. Kurogane's laboratory with it in the process.
SK0602,1317,With the girls freed from the underground prison cells, Dr. Kurogane's scheme has been foiled!
SK0602,1318,However, so long as evil remains in the world, Masked Red's battle never ends!
SK0602,1319,Fight on, Masked Red! You're our hero, Masked Red! <br> -The End
SK0602,1320,Go, Masked Red! Fight on, Masked Red! Tune in next time!
SK0602,1321,I'm worried about Reni... I should stop here.
SK0602,1322,All right, where to next?
SK0602,1323,Oh... 6 o'clock already...
SK0602,1324,I should go see Reni already.
SK0602,1325,OK, let's try talking to Reni.
SK0602,1326,Tell me some gossip.
SK0602,1327,I'll come back later.
SK0602,1328,Oh yeah, Ogami, have you met Tsubomi, our new shopkeep, yet?
SK0602,1329,Yeah, I just ran into her. She, uh, sure seems lively.
SK0602,1330,Yes, she seems overjoyed to be working here.
SK0602,1331,We have to be on our best behavior with a new girl on the team, too!
SK0602,1332,By the way, Ogami, I have a huge scoop.
SK0602,1333,A huge scoop, you say?
SK0602,1334,Uh huh! It's Tsubaki's number while she's out on her secret assignment!
SK0602,1335,H-Huh?! You know her number?
SK0602,1336,Yes, she has a transceiver on hand in case of emergency.
SK0602,1337,Ready, Ogami? Her number is: 13600.
SK0602,1338,13600... Got it. There, it's written down now.
SK0602,1339,You better call her now after I went through all the trouble of getting it for you!
SK0602,1340,Yeah, of course. I'll call her.
SK0602,1341,Oh, I already found out myself. 13600, right?
SK0602,1342,By yourself?! Wow, Ogami, you sure don't waste any time, do you?
SK0602,1343,Wh-What's that supposed to mean?
SK0602,1344,Hm hm, I'm sure Tsubaki was quite surprised to receive a call from you out of the blue, too.
SK0602,1345,By the way, just where is Tsubaki, anyway?
SK0602,1346,Heehee, about that...
SK0602,1347,Yuri! That's top-secret, remember?
SK0602,1348,Huh?! But I wanna tell him! It's OK if we only tell Ogami, right?
SK0602,1349,Absolutely not.
SK0602,1350,We'll tell you when the time is right, Ogami, so please just bear with us.
SK0602,1351,O... OK.
SK0602,1352,Oh yeah, Ogami, the Rose Division just finished setting up a room downstairs!
SK0602,1353,When did they find the time to do that?
SK0602,1354,They have all kinds of interesting stories.
SK0602,1355,You might hear some interesting rumors from them, so drop by and say hi every now and then!
SK0602,1356,Oh boy, that's Yuri for you.
SK0602,1357,It seems like this typhoon is hitting the Kanto region head-on. I'm worried.
SK0602,1358,They're even telling everyone on the radio not to go out tonight.
SK0602,1359,It's true, the scariest part of a storm like this isn't the rain, it's being hit by flying objects.
SK0602,1360,Transit around the capital will come to a standstill, too.
SK0602,1361,It's finally time for the autumn production to start, isn't it, Ogami.
SK0602,1362,"The Blue Bird", right? I'm looking forward to it, too.
SK0602,1363,It's Reni's big debut, all the patrons are talking about it.
SK0602,1364,Ticket preorders are selling like hotcakes, too.
SK0602,1365,Really? Guess everyone's looking forward to this one.
SK0602,1366,(But with Reni the way she is right now, how will it turn out?)
SK0602,1367,That's right, I heard some amazing news on the radio yesterday.
SK0602,1368,Oh, you mean about that steam submarine?
SK0602,1369,...Steam submarine?
SK0602,1370,Yes, that steam submarine that wouldn't resurface no matter what anyone tried.
SK0602,1371,Apparently they pulled it out of the water with nothing but rope and manpower!
SK0602,1372,Wow, really?
SK0602,1373,That's the honest truth. They said so on the news.
SK0602,1374,How was your vacation last month, Ogami?
SK0602,1375,It got pretty crazy, but I had a lot of fun. Wish you could've come with us.
SK0602,1376,*sigh* I bought a new swimsuit and everything, but I never get the chance to wear it.
SK0602,1377,Oh? Didn't you swim in the underground pool while everyone was on vacation?
SK0602,1378,Yeah, but that's just our pool. I'm not gonna find any cute boys to swim with there.
SK0602,1379,Sorry, Ogami, but I'm all out of gossip for now.
SK0602,1380,I'll have some more interesting tidbits for you another time, so look forward to it!
SK0602,1381,I'll be back. Good luck with your work.
SK0602,1382,OK. Thanks for coming, Ogami.

SK0602,1451,Ayame and I almost never lived in the same household, even though we were sisters.
SK0602,1452,Eh...?
SK0602,1453,It’s not so unusual, given our lineage. We have less a “family tree” and more a “family wisteria.”
SK0602,1454,Yet, I still knew that she was the type of person that would sacrifice her own well-being for others...
SK0602,1455,Carrying everyone’s burdens by herself...
SK0602,1456,That’s why, when I received the news that she had passed away, I made up my mind.
SK0602,1457,I want to carry on her will. I want to protect the capital, just like she did.
SK0602,1458,And for my own sake, too.
SK0602,1459,...I suppose that’s all I have to say.
SK0602,1460,You know, Ogami, I came here to work of my own volition.
SK0602,1461,To protect the peace of this city, and to cherish our audience's smiles.
SK0602,1462,I'm sure you feel the same, Ogami.
SK0602,1463,Yes, of course.
SK0602,1464,So let’s both do our best.
SK0602,1465,For my sister... <br> For everyone...
SK0602,1466,Yes ma'am!
SK0602,1467,Well, today I will tell you about the Anti-Kouma Corps.
SK0602,1468,The Anti-Kouma Corps was the army's predecessor to the Imperial Assault Troupe.
SK0602,1469,Ikki Yoneda, Kazuma Shinguji, Shinnosuke Yamazaki, and... Ayame Fujieda.
SK0602,1470,A special unit, comprising only those four, formed to defend the capital from evil.
SK0602,1471,Seven years ago... A Kouma appeared in Nihonbashi.
SK0602,1472,Even though it was just a single Kouma, the military and police were powerless against it.
SK0602,1473,However, the Anti-Kouma Corps managed to seal the Kouma away, albeit at great cost.
SK0602,1474,That incident made the government painfully aware of the need to defend against such evil.
SK0602,1475,As a result, the Imperial Assault Troupe as you know it was born.
SK0602,1476,The troupe is the fruit of the Anti-Kouma Corps' will.
SK0602,1477,And, of the four members, only General Yoneda is still alive today.
SK0602,1478,For the sake of those four, who protected the people from evil... We have to keep fighting.
SK0602,1479,...
SK0602,1480,Now then, today I’ll tell you about Ayame’s travels.
SK0602,1481,In order to recruit members for the Flower Division, Ayame traveled around the world.
SK0602,1482,She searched for suitable candidates for the Flower Division, girls with powerful spiritual abilities.
SK0602,1483,She sent me letters from various countries. America, France, China...
SK0602,1484,Whenever she did, I must be honest, I envied her.
SK0602,1485,I see, so she did all that...
SK0602,1486,Those same candidates make up the Flower Division we have now.
SK0602,1487,And you know what, Ogami? Recently, I've been thinking...
SK0602,1488,The people Ayame chose truly were the best people for the job. That includes you.
SK0602,1489,Kaede...
SK0602,1490,Ayame entrusted the Flower Division to me, so I'll continue to give it my all.
SK0602,1491,Don't give up. Even in the hardest of times, remember to never give up, Ogami.
SK0602,1492,Yes ma’am! I will do all I can to meet your expectations!
SK0602,1493,Now then, today I’ll tell you about Ayame and Major Yamazaki.
SK0602,1494,Both Ayame and Major Yamazaki were members of the Imperial Assault Troupe's predecessor, the Anti-Kouma Corps.
SK0602,1495,Major Yamazaki was a brilliant scientist who came up with the foundational designs for Spirit Armor...
SK0602,1496,And they say he had a stronger sense of justice than most.
SK0602,1497,Anyone could see that Ayame and Major Yamazaki were deeply in love with each other...
SK0602,1498,But their relationship crumbled when the Kouma War started.
SK0602,1499,What could have possibly caused that?
SK0602,1500,Now, this is pure conjecture...
SK0602,1501,But it seems that during their battles with the Kouma, Major Yamazaki became obsessed with certain questions.
SK0602,1502,What are these demons?" "Why do they exist?"
SK0602,1503,And "how are they so powerful?"
SK0602,1504,General Yoneda noticed that Major Yamazaki had changed, and he warned him many times.
SK0602,1505,But, in the end, no one could change his mind.
SK0602,1506,...not even Ayame...
SK0602,1507,When the Kouma War ended seven years ago, Major Yamazaki went missing.
SK0602,1508,And then in our recent battles, he appeared again as Cerulean Satan.
SK0602,1509,Justice by power... <br> Rule through evil...
SK0602,1510,Perhaps that was his conclusion...
SK0602,1511,Back when he appeared in front of the theater six months ago...
SK0602,1512,I wonder what Cerulean Satan... No, what Major Yamazaki was trying to tell us...
SK0602,1513,...
SK0603,1,...I'm coming in.
SK0603,2,Sorry for barging in like this. I was just worried about what happened during your rehearsal.
SK0603,3,...
SK0603,4,Are you not feeling well?
SK0603,5,...
SK0603,6,Reni?
SK0603,7,Captain...
SK0603,8,...Reni?
SK0603,9,What... What am I... What am I fighting for?
SK0603,10,Huh?
SK0603,11,I... I don't know what I'm fighting for anymore.
SK0603,12,Captain... What is it that YOU'RE fighting for?
SK0603,13,Well, you see...
SK0603,14,To protect the capital.
SK0603,15,For justice.
SK0603,16,To protect the capital.
SK0603,17,For justice.
SK0603,18,To find the blue bird of happiness.
SK0603,19,I'm fighting to protect the capital. That's our duty as the Imperial Assault Troupe.
SK0603,20,The capital... has nothing to do with me.
SK0603,21,Huh?!
SK0603,22,For justice, of course.
SK0603,23,...Justice?
SK0603,24,That's right. We defeat evil and represent our justice. That's our job.
SK0603,25,Justice through destroying evil. An ideal stained in blood... Is that why you fight?
SK0603,26,Reni...
SK0603,27,Heh, isn't it obvious? It's to find to the blue bird.
SK0603,28,Now, let's look for the blue bird of happiness, together!
SK0603,29,J-Just kidding! Ha, hahaha... Are you feeling better yet?
SK0603,30,...I guess not.
SK0603,31,Hmmm... That's a tough question.
SK0603,32,I haven't ever seriously thought about why it is that I fight.
SK0603,33,...I see.
SK0603,34,...
SK0603,35,...Get out.
SK0603,36,Huh?
SK0603,37,I'm going to bed.
SK0603,38,B-But...
SK0603,39,Just go already!
SK0603,40,Reni...
SK0603,41,...
SK0603,42,What am I fighting for?
SK0603,43,What am I... fighting for? Hmm...
SK0603,44,Ah, what a joy this is... Yo, Ogami!
SK0603,45,That voice, is that...?
SK0603,46,I knew it, it WAS you! What are you even doing?!
SK0603,47,Hey, Ogami. What a lovely night it is...
SK0603,48,I like to hang upside-down like this when it's dark out.
SK0603,49,What are you, a bat?!
SK0603,50,Hmm, a bat, huh?
SK0603,51,Yes, I am but a lone bat, flapping through the night...
SK0603,52,...Whatever, just get in here.
SK0603,53,Hmph, very well. Alley-oop!
SK0603,54,By the way, Ogami, would you say you hold any beliefs?
SK0603,55,Wh-What's all this, out of the blue?
SK0603,56,There's an old saying: "Faith can move mountains."
SK0603,57,Don't speak with words. Don't think with logic. Your answer lies elsewhere.
SK0603,58,You understand, Ogami?
SK0603,59,I see. It's true, I was having trouble putting my answer to Reni into words...
SK0603,60,What Reni needs isn't words or logic. It's my honest feelings.
SK0603,61,You must not falter, Ogami. To falter would be to play into the enemy's hands. You must stay true to your beliefs.
SK0603,62,Yeah, got it. I appreciate the advice.
SK0603,63,I'd expect nothing less from my rival. I'll see you later, Ogami. Alley-OOP!
SK0603,64,There we go... Well then, Ogami, farewell! Adiòs! Till we meet again!
SK0603,65,...Seriously, what's with that guy?
SK0603,66,Mon Frèèère! Are you in there?
SK0603,67,Oh, it's Iris this time. Come in, door's open.
SK0603,68,OK, I'm coming in!
SK0603,69,Hey, Iris, what's up?
SK0603,70,Guess what, Mon Frère? I made this for Reni!
SK0603,71,A flower crown?
SK0603,72,I see, so this is what you were up to in the yard this afternoon.
SK0603,73,Uh-huh! I thought Reni looked kinda sad.
SK0603,74,If I give her this flower crown as a present, I'm sure she'll cheer right up!
SK0603,75,You put your heart into that flower crown, Iris. I'm sure it'll cheer her up.
SK0603,76,And and and! I was hoping you'd come with me to give it to her. Will you?
SK0603,77,Sure, let's go.
SK0603,78,I don't feel like it.
SK0603,79,I want a flower crown, too.
SK0603,80,Sure, let's go. I'm a little worried about Reni, myself.
SK0603,81,Yaaay! Thanks, Mon Frère!
SK0603,82,Right, then, shall we go?
SK0603,83,I don't feel like it.
SK0603,84,Huh? But why?
SK0603,85,Iris... Could you make me a flower crown, too?
SK0603,86,Huh? Sure, but you have to do something for me first.
SK0603,87,All right, sure, what is it?
SK0603,88,You have to come to Reni's room with me!
SK0603,89,Haha, guess I don't have a choice. Got it, let's go.
SK0603,90,Yaaay! Thanks, Mon Frère!
SK0603,91,Right, then, shall we go?
SK0603,92,...
SK0603,93,What's wrong, Mon Frère? Don't you wanna come with me?
SK0603,94,No, that's not it, I was just thinking about what to say.
SK0603,95,I actually went to see her earlier, but she kicked me out of her room.
SK0603,96,Heehee, then why don't you come with me and you can patch things up?
SK0603,97,B-But I...
SK0603,98,C'mon, hurry! Let's go, Mon Frère!
SK0603,99,Iris, w-wait! You don't have to pull on me, I'm coming!
SK0603,100,...
SK0603,101,Hm? What's wrong, Iris?
SK0603,102,Mon Frère... Do you think Reni will like it?
SK0603,103,It's all right. I'm sure she will.
SK0603,104,...OK!
SK0603,105,Reni? Are you there?
SK0603,106,...Did you need something?
SK0603,107,Uh-huh, but I'm not telling you what until you open this doooor!
SK0603,108,...What is it?
SK0603,109,Teehee! Here you go! It's a present from me to you!
SK0603,110,What is this?
SK0603,111,A flower crown I made just for you! It's pretty, right?
SK0603,112,Iris... Why did you do this for me?
SK0603,113,Because you're my friend, Reni!
SK0603,114,And when my friends are feeling sad, I'm always there to cheer them up!
SK0603,115,I'm... your friend?
SK0603,116,Reni, Iris poured her heart into making that flower crown.
SK0603,117,...
SK0603,118,We might not know what exactly it is that's bothering you...
SK0603,119,But we'll always be by your side, watching over you. This flower crown is proof of that.
SK0603,120,...
SK0603,121,So... You'll take it, right, Reni?
SK0603,122,Yeah... Thank... Thank you, Iris.
SK0603,123,Ah! Mon Frère, look! Reni smiled!
SK0603,124,Yeah. Isn't that great, Iris?
SK0603,125,Yeah!
SK0603,126,All right, Reni, it's getting late. Get a good night's sleep, OK?
SK0603,127,...OK. Good night.
SK0603,128,Well, Iris, we should head back to our own rooms too.
SK0603,129,Uh-huh! Thanks for your help, Mon Frère! OK, good night!
SK0603,130,Yeah. Good night, Iris.
SK0603,131,Hm hm hm...
SK0603,132,Looks like the rats are finally starting to catch on... Now's my chance.
SK0603,133,Flowers... Iris is... my friend?
SK0603,134,Hm hm hm... A false friend, that is.
SK0603,135,Who's there?!
SK0603,136,Saki?
SK0603,137,Reni, you're just like me, you know.
SK0603,138,Wha... What are you doing?
SK0603,139,There's no such thing as friends you can trust. The only one you can rely on in the battlefield... is yourself.
SK0603,140,I'm sure you know that very well, don't you, Reni?
SK0603,141,I... I...
SK0603,142,You've always been completely, utterly alone... But there's nothing to worry about.
SK0603,143,In the heat of battle, everyone is alone.
SK0603,144,Ah...
SK0603,145,Now, come with me.
SK0603,146,You're just a machine, born only to fight. You don't need any friends.
SK0603,147,...!!
SK0603,148,
SK0603,149,Hm hm hm hm hm...
SK0603,150,Our master will be thrilled to have you.
SK0603,151,Imperial Assault Troupe... Your comrade, Reni, now belongs to me, Saki Kageyama...
SK0603,152,Or rather, Suiko of the Black Demon Society!

SK0603,199,So sorry, Ogami, but each customer is only allowed to purchase one photo at a time.
SK0603,200,Oh, really? That's too bad.

SK0604,1,The wind's gotten strong.
SK0604,2,Indeed. It'll be a proper storm, soon.
SK0604,3,Now, about the incident... Do you have anything to report?
SK0604,4,You mean the assassination attempt on Commander Yoneda.
SK0604,5,As a result of our covert investigation, we've managed to narrow down our suspects.
SK0604,6,The culprit is most likely just as you theorized, vice commander.
SK0604,7,Saki Kageyama, right?
SK0604,8,But why? What's her goal? Why would she...
SK0604,9,We analyzed the timing of Saki's transmissions with the troupe's deployments and found a connection.
SK0604,10,Whenever Saki would send out a transmission, the Black Demons always made a move a few days later.
SK0604,11,What?! Then that means... It can't be!
SK0604,12,Of course, this is ultimately pure conjecture.
SK0604,13,Damn! If Saki knows our current status, then she probably...
SK0604,14,Oh no! Reni's in danger!!
SK0604,15,Stormy outside, eh?
SK0604,16,It's kind of late, after talking to Kayama and Reni, but I should go out on my night watch.
SK0604,17,But still, I have a really bad feeling about this.

SK0605,1,Ah, Mon Frère!
SK0605,2,Iris?! What are you doing up this late?!
SK0605,3,I stopped by Reni's room just now.
SK0605,4,I knocked on the door, but she didn't answer.
SK0605,5,That's strange, where could she be at this hour?
SK0605,6,I feel nervous for some reason. My heart won't stop pounding.
SK0605,7,Almost like... Reni's going to leave us.
SK0605,8,Like she's going somewhere far away.
SK0605,9,Come with me, Mon Frère! I wanna go to Reni's room one more time.
SK0605,10,I see. Well I AM worried about her...
SK0605,11,OK, let's go. Follow me, Iris.
SK0605,12,OK...
SK0605,13,All right, we're here.
SK0605,14,Still no answer.
SK0605,15,Mon Frère...
SK0605,16,Hm? The door's open.
SK0605,17,All right, Iris, let's go inside.
SK0605,18,...OK.
SK0605,19,Reni? We're coming in...
SK0605,20,Sure enough, she's not here.
SK0605,21,Ah! Mon Frère, look over there!
SK0605,22,Isn't that the flower crown you made for her?
SK0605,23,Did Reni... throw it away?
SK0605,24,No, she looked so happy when you gave it to her.
SK0605,25,That's strange... I have a bad feeling about this.
SK0605,26,Ah, Chief! There you are!
SK0605,27,Kohran?!
SK0605,28,What's wrong, Kohran?! Did something happen?!
SK0605,29,Just now... Reni took her Eisenkleid and ran off!
SK0605,30,Wha-What did you say?!
SK0605,31,She just showed up in the hangar, then booked it before I had the chance to stop her.
SK0605,32,And her eyes, there was something weird about 'em.
SK0605,33,Almost like... she was possessed or something.
SK0605,34,Reni...
SK0605,35,Damn it! We have an emergency. Round everyone up and report to the war room, stat!
SK0605,36,Roger!
SK0605,37,Reni... What the hell's going on?!
SK0605,38,Ah, there you are, Ogami.
SK0605,39,Kaede? What are you doing here this late?
SK0605,40,You haven't seen Saki Kageyama around, have you, Ogami?
SK0605,41,Huh? Saki? No, can't say that I have.
SK0605,42,What's wrong, Kaede? You usually never address Saki like that...
SK0605,43,I'll explain later. Sorry, I have to go, I'm in a hurry.
SK0605,44,Kaede looked really on edge. I wonder what's wrong?
SK0605,45,Nobody's here. I'm all alone in this lobby.
SK0605,46,Well, this is kinda depressing. I should go somewhere else.
SK0605,47,Man, is it stormy out. Been a while since we've had a storm like this.
SK0605,48,OK, the doors are shut tight, and it doesn't look like anyone's outside.
SK0605,49,The auditorium is totally soundproofed, so you can't even hear the storm from in here.
SK0605,50,Well, nothing unusual here. I should go.
SK0605,51,Nothing unusual at the shop.
SK0605,52,The storm doesn't seem like it's letting up anytime soon. The wind's getting louder and louder.
SK0605,53,All you can hear right now is the wind.
SK0605,54,Well, I should go somewhere else. Nothing particularly unusual here.
SK0605,55,I hope we're prepped for a fire. Fires are unusually common in times like this.
SK0605,56,...OK, inspection complete. Nothing out of the ordinary here. I should move on.
SK0605,57,The rain is so loud against the glass, it sounds like someone's knocking on a door.
SK0605,58,...OK, looks like it's shut tight. I should move on.
SK0605,59,Kasumi and Yuri are long since gone already.
SK0605,60,Well, no problems here in the office. Time to move on.
SK0605,61,Zzzzzz... Zzzzzz...
SK0605,62,The manager's snoring so loud, it's giving the storm a run for its money.
SK0605,63,I don't think I need to check on this room.
SK0605,64,Nobody's here...
SK0605,65,I should go. If the piano starts playing itself, I'm going to freak out.
SK0605,66,The costume room at night... It's kinda creepy, I don't think I want to stick around here too long.
SK0605,67,Doesn't seem like anything's out of the ordinary. I should get going.
SK0605,68,Feels kinda lonely to be backstage with no one else around.
SK0605,69,Nothing unusual here. I should keep moving.
SK0605,70,The door to the courtyard's shut tight.
SK0605,71,I don't think I'd want to go out in the pouring rain anyway. Guess I'll get going.
SK0605,72,This place sorta gives me the creeps.
SK0605,73,I should get going. Nothing's going to change by me sticking around here.
SK0605,74,It's so quiet in here, like there wasn't even a storm at all. The room's perfectly soundproofed.
SK0605,75,Well, nothing unusual here. Where to next?
SK0605,76,Only thing I might find here is a mouse or something.
SK0605,77,Nothing unusual here. Moving on.
SK0605,78,I wonder what Sakura's up to?
SK0605,79,Sakura? It's me, Ogami.
SK0605,80,Oh, Ogami...
SK0605,81,You really came. I'm glad...
SK0605,82,What's wrong, Sakura? Are you all right?
SK0605,83,EEEEEEEEK!!
SK0605,84,Sakura! Are you OK?!
SK0605,85,N-No... Not really.
SK0605,86,I thought I got used to the lightning, but... I guess I'm still scared of it after all.
SK0605,87,Sakura...
SK0605,88,Go inside and hold her.
SK0605,89,Cheer her up from outside.
SK0605,90,Sakura, could you let me in?
SK0605,91,Huh? W-Why?
SK0605,92,Uh, I thought I'd come in and give you a hug.
SK0605,93,Huh?!
SK0605,94,I'm flattered, Ogami, really...
SK0605,95,But I probably shouldn't be letting boys into my room at this hour, sorry.
SK0605,96,I-I see. Hmmm, that's too bad...
SK0605,97,Sheesh, Ogami...
SK0605,98,I'm on my night watch right now, and I shouldn't be going inside any girls' rooms this late at night...
SK0605,99,But if you want, I can stay with you out here. You can relax.
SK0605,100,Ogami...
SK0605,101,Ogami... Could you... answer me back?
SK0605,102,Ogami...
SK0605,103,(What a cute nameplate, it suits Sakura perfectly)
SK0605,104,...Ogami?
SK0605,105,What is it, Sakura?
SK0605,106,Thank goodness. I thought you might have left.
SK0605,107,...
SK0605,108,...Ogami?
SK0605,109,Ogami?! You're so mean!
SK0605,110,...Ogami? Ogami?!
SK0605,111,What is it, Sakura?
SK0605,112,Oh, thank goodness. I thought you might've left already.
SK0605,113,It's all right, Sakura. If anything happens, I'll be there in an instant.
SK0605,114,Anyway, it's late. You should head to bed.
SK0605,115,OK...
SK0605,116,Ogami... Thank you for worrying about me.
SK0605,117,Talking to you's helped me calm down a little.
SK0605,118,Really? That's good.
SK0605,119,Sorry for bothering you during your night watch.
SK0605,120,I'll... try to brave the lightning.
SK0605,121,...I see.
SK0605,122,Right, I should get going. Good night, Sakura.
SK0605,123,OK... Good night, Ogami.
SK0605,124,OK...
SK0605,125,It's me... So, what next?
SK0605,126,I've managed to calm down, for the most part.
SK0605,127,I'm still scared, but I'll manage.
SK0605,128,You've got this, Sakura.
SK0605,129,...
SK0605,130,(Is Sakura mad at me?)
SK0605,131,(Oh well, better move on.)
SK0605,132,It's just like Sakura to have a cute nameplate like this.
SK0605,133,OK, let's check another room.
SK0605,134,Iris... Is she inside?
SK0605,135,...Who is it?
SK0605,136,It's me, Ogami. You still awake?
SK0605,137,Mon Frère...
SK0605,138,You haven't even changed into your pajamas. What's wrong?
SK0605,139,I feel nervous for some reason. My heart won't stop pounding.
SK0605,140,Almost like... Reni's going to leave us.
SK0605,141,Like she's going somewhere far away.
SK0605,142,Iris...
SK0605,143,I'm going to Reni's room! I'm worried about her!
SK0605,144,H-Hey, Iris!
SK0605,145,Reniiii... Are you in there?
SK0605,146,Reni! Answer me, Reni!
SK0605,147,Iris...
SK0605,148,Hm? Hold on, Iris. The door's open...
SK0605,149,All right, Iris, let's go inside.
SK0605,150,...OK.
SK0605,151,So Iris's nameplate is shaped like Jean-Paul.
SK0605,152,OK, I'll check another room.
SK0605,153,Ah, there you are, Ogami.
SK0605,154,Kaede? What are you doing here this late?
SK0605,155,You haven't seen Saki Kageyama around, have you, Ogami?
SK0605,156,Huh? Saki? No, can't say that I have.
SK0605,157,What's wrong, Kaede? You usually never address Saki like that...
SK0605,158,I'll explain later. Sorry, I have to go, I'm in a hurry.
SK0605,159,Kaede looked really on edge. I wonder what's wrong?
SK0605,160,Kaede? Are you in there?
SK0605,161,I better check another room, I guess.
SK0605,162,No answer. Guess there's no one in there.
SK0605,163,In which case, where could Kaede be?
SK0605,164,Ah, Mon Frère...
SK0605,165,Iris?! What are you doing up this late?!
SK0605,166,I feel nervous for some reason. My heart won't stop pounding.
SK0605,167,Almost like... Reni's going to leave us.
SK0605,168,It feels like she's going somewhere far away.
SK0605,169,I see. OK, let's go talk to Reni.
SK0605,170,That's weird. She's not in her room at this hour.
SK0605,171,Mon Frère...
SK0605,172,Hm? The door's open.
SK0605,173,All right, Iris, let's go inside.
SK0605,174,...OK.
SK0605,175,Maria? Are you there?
SK0605,176,Who is it?
SK0605,177,It's Ogami.
SK0605,178,Oh, Captain. Good work with the night watch.
SK0605,179,Sorry to bother you so late. You weren't asleep, were you?
SK0605,180,It's all right. I was just reading.
SK0605,181,Nothing's out of the ordinary in here.
SK0605,182,I see. OK then, good night.
SK0605,183,Keep up the good work, Captain.
SK0605,184,(Maria's reading in there. I probably shouldn't call out to her.)
SK0605,185,It's Maria's nameplate.
SK0605,186,OK, time to check another room.
SK0605,187,I wonder if Kanna is inside.
SK0605,188,Zzz... No, I couldn't eat another bite...
SK0605,189,Huh, guess she's already asleep.
SK0605,190,No answer. Did she go somewhere?
SK0605,191,Kanna's... Well, I guess it's more of a nametag than a nameplate.
SK0605,192,OK, let's check another room.
SK0605,193,I wonder if Sumire is inside.
SK0605,194,Zzz... Zzz...
SK0605,195,Sounds like she's already fast asleep.
SK0605,196,Sumire's already asleep. I should leave her be.
SK0605,197,This is a pretty subtle design, considering it's Sumire.
SK0605,198,Let's check another room.
SK0605,199,I wonder if Kohran is inside.
SK0605,200,No answer...
SK0605,201,A gear-shaped nameplate, huh? It's just Kohran's style.
SK0605,202,Let's check another room.
SK0605,203,Orihime... Is she in her room?
SK0605,204,Yeeees? Who is it?
SK0605,205,It's Ogami, I'm here on my night watch.
SK0605,206,You're a pretty hard worker, Ensign.
SK0605,207,I'm all right. I was just enjoying the typhoon's melody.
SK0605,208,The rhythm and tempo are simply wonderful. I'd love to play it on the piano sometime.
SK0605,209,Hahaha, the typhoon's no match for you, Orihime.
SK0605,210,All right, I have to go. Good night, Orihime.
SK0605,211,Good luck with your evening stroll.
SK0605,212,She'll get mad at me if I keep bugging her. I should leave her be.
SK0605,213,The name plate has a simple design, but it sure looks classy.
SK0605,214,Let's go check another room.
SK0605,215,Autumn nights are long, and yet I still don't feel like reading on days like this.
SK0605,216,I should go, there's nothing out of the ordinary here.
SK0605,217,No one's here, just the sound of wind and rain.
SK0605,218,Nothing unusual here. I should keep moving.
SK0605,219,It's too early to end the night watch yet.
SK0605,220,I can't get a signal in this storm, either. I should go somewhere else.
SK0605,221,Figures nobody would be here this late at night.
SK0605,222,I should get going. There's nothing unusual here anyway.
SK0605,223,Stepping out on the terrace right now would just get me soaked.
SK0605,224,Seems like the door's shut tight. OK, moving on, then.
SK0605,225,You can hear the howling of the wind all the way here.
SK0605,226,Nothing unusual here. I should get going.
SK0605,227,Day or night, this place never changes much.
SK0605,228,Everything seems normal here. OK, where to next?
SK0605,229,Whoa... That was some intense lightning.
SK0605,230,The storm's gotten a lot more intense ever since nightfall.
SK0605,231,Huh? Looks like someone's in the bathroom.
SK0605,232,Those clothes, and that headband... Those must be Kanna's.
SK0605,233,Which would mean Kanna's the one inside, right?
SK0605,234,My body is moving towards the bathroom on its own...
SK0605,235,Go back outside.
SK0605,236,Oh no, my body is moving towards the bathroom on its own...
SK0605,237,(K-Kanna...)
SK0605,238,(Hmmm, I can't see that well through all this steam...)
SK0605,239,(C-Crap!)
SK0605,240,Huh? Who's there?!
SK0605,241,Be upfront.
SK0605,242,Run away.
SK0605,243,Be upfront.
SK0605,244,Hey, Kanna, how's the water in there?
SK0605,245,B-Boss?!
SK0605,246,You dumbass! Don't look at me!
SK0605,247,K-Kanna...
SK0605,248,Shut up! Just get the hell out of here!
SK0605,249,Y-Yes, ma'am!
SK0605,250,(I gotta get out of here before she sees me!)
SK0605,251,Stop right there! Boss, is that you?!
SK0605,252,(C-Crap! I can't believe she already spotted me!)
SK0605,253,Peeping on me in the bath and trying to sneak away... That's real low, Boss!
SK0605,254,I-I'm sorry! I'll be leaving now!!
SK0605,255,Whoa! Is... Is that you, Boss?!
SK0605,256,(Crap! No use in running now!)
SK0605,257,Wh-What the hell are you doing just standing there?!
SK0605,258,I, uh... I didn't know what to do, so...
SK0605,259,Just get the hell out of here!
SK0605,260,Yes, ma'am! Right away, ma'am!
SK0605,261,...
SK0605,262,I'm sorry, Kanna. I just sorta found my way in there, and...
SK0605,263,You walked in fully aware, you didn't just "find your way in there."
SK0605,264,Y-You're right. I really am sorry.
SK0605,265,Well, I'm not gonna chew you out for this one...
SK0605,266,But I'm a woman, too, y'know. You gotta be more considerate.
SK0605,267,Kanna...
SK0605,268,All right, I'm gonna get going. Quit peeping during your night watch, all right?
SK0605,269,Hmm... That went about as poorly as I expected.
SK0605,270,But it's true, Kanna IS a woman, after all.
SK0605,271,(I have to get out of here before Kanna sees me!)
SK0605,272,Phew... Looks like she didn't see me.
SK0605,273,I can't be peeping in the baths like this. This is enough as it is.
SK0605,274,Phew! Welp, time to get out.
SK0605,275,(Oh crap!! It looks like she's getting out of the water!)
SK0605,276,(I gotta get out of here before she sees me!)
SK0605,277,Phew, I think I got away before she realized I was there.
SK0605,278,If I was even a second too late, I would be in big trouble.
SK0605,279,Yo, Boss! Lookin' to take a bath?
SK0605,280,No, I'm in the middle of my nightly rounds.
SK0605,281,I see. Thanks for working so hard this late.
SK0605,282,I just got out of the bath, myself. Nothing unusual to report in there.
SK0605,283,Welp, good luck with your night watch. Night, Boss.
SK0605,284,Right then, I should get back to my night watch.
SK0605,285,Kanna already left, and there's nobody else in here.
SK0605,286,Nothing out of the ordinary here. I should get going.
SK0605,287,Oh, if it ain't the Chief.
SK0605,288,Oh, Kohran. Maintaining the Koubu as usual, I see.
SK0605,289,Spirit armors are something else, I tell ya.
SK0605,290,The man who built the original Koubu units was none other than Shinnosuke Yamazaki himself.
SK0605,291,It's true that he did some unforgivable things...
SK0605,292,But he really was a bonafide technological genius.
SK0605,293,I see...
SK0605,294,For real, though, spirit armors are the invention of the century, to say nothing of their power.
SK0605,295,You could even say they're "armor"-zing! Get it? Ahahahaha!
SK0605,296,Ahahahaha!
SK0605,297,Oh, a wise guy, eh?
SK0605,298,Ahahahaha!
SK0605,299,Ahahaha! Nice one, Kohran. That was pretty funny.
SK0605,300,Really? You think so? Heheh, glad you think so.
SK0605,301,...Ahahaha! Nice one, Kohran. That was pretty funny.
SK0605,302,Hmm, it took you a while to laugh at that one.
SK0605,303,You weren't forcing that laughter just now, were you?
SK0605,304,N-No, of course not.
SK0605,305,Really? You don't have to laugh if you don't wanna. I hate lies, remember?
SK0605,306,Oh, a wise guy, eh?
SK0605,307,...I was, uh, trying to do the straight man routine, there.
SK0605,308,Ahahaha! Not bad, Chief!
SK0605,309,You're a proper straight man, now! You've improved a lot!
SK0605,310,Y-You think so?
SK0605,311,Oh, oh jeez... Not funny, huh? Sorry.
SK0605,312,N-No, I just didn't know how to respond.
SK0605,313,Well, you don't have to laugh if you don't find it funny. Maybe try following it up instead.
SK0605,314,It's kinda lonely when only one of us is cracking jokes, y'know?
SK0605,315,I-I see. I'll remember that for next time.
SK0605,316,Well, that's enough for today, I'm calling it here.
SK0605,317,All right, I gotta clean up, Chief, so I'll see ya later.
SK0605,318,Yeah, good work today.
SK0605,319,Right, I should get back to my rounds.
SK0605,320,Oh, if it ain't the Chief.
SK0605,321,Kohran? Staying up late to maintain the Koubu, I see?
SK0605,322,Yep, I was so caught up in my work, I totally lost track of the time.
SK0605,323,Man, time just slips away when you're in the zone.
SK0605,324,It's too late for this.
SK0605,325,Don't overdo it.
SK0605,326,I appreciate the hard work, but it's too for this.
SK0605,327,S-Sorry. I guess I kinda went overboard.
SK0605,328,Glad to see you taking your night watch seriously, Chief. Nice going.
SK0605,329,Well, I'm the captain, it's all part of the job.
SK0605,330,All right, I gotta clean up, Chief, so I'll see ya later.
SK0605,331,Yeah, good work today.
SK0605,332,Right, I should get back to my rounds.
SK0605,333,Don't overdo it, OK? We wouldn't want you to catch a cold or something.
SK0605,334,No need to worry, I'm all done anyway.
SK0605,335,All right, I gotta clean up, Chief, so I'll see ya later.
SK0605,336,Yeah, good work today.
SK0605,337,Right, I should get back to my rounds.
SK0605,338,Well, that's enough for today, I'm calling it here.
SK0605,339,All right, I gotta clean up, Chief, so I'll see ya later.
SK0605,340,Yeah, good work today.
SK0605,341,Right, I should get back to my rounds.
SK0605,342,Oh, Chief. It's gonna take me a bit longer to clean up.
SK0605,343,I see. Don't stay up too late, though.
SK0605,344,Yeah, I know. All right, good luck on your night watch, Chief.
SK0605,345,All right, I should get back to it.
SK0605,346,G-Good evening.
SK0605,347,Oh my, Ogami! What are you doing here so late?
SK0605,348,Uh, I'm here on my night watch.
SK0605,349,Well thank you for the hard work. We were just in the middle of our debriefing meeting for today.
SK0605,350,Debriefing?
SK0605,351,We reflect on our makeup and speech from the past day and give constructive feedback to each other.
SK0605,352,Doing this daily is what helps us enhance our beauty!
SK0605,353,I know! You should join us. How does that sound, Kikunojo?
SK0605,354,Um... Ah... I'm so embarrassed...
SK0605,355,Why not, Kiku? I think it's a great idea!
SK0605,356,C'mon, Ichiro, come chat with us about your beauty!
SK0605,357,I-I'm in the middle of my night watch, so I have to go!
SK0605,358,Ah, Ichiro!
SK0605,359,Good grief... Holding a meeting like that in the dead of night...
SK0605,360,That room is truly terrifying...
SK0605,361,Oh, Ogami! So you've decided to join our meeting after all?
SK0605,362,EEEEK! Ichiro! I'm so happy!
SK0605,363,N-Nope, just checking in! I have to go!
SK0605,364,Ah, Ichiro!
SK0605,365,Wh-Why do I keep going in there...?
SK0605,366,Anyway, I should get back to my rounds.
SK0605,367,It's a total mess in here, as usual.
SK0605,368,Nothing out of the ordinary, though. I should check somewhere else.
SK0605,369,The training room... Nobody's here at the moment.
SK0605,370,Well, nothing unusual here. Onto the next stop.
SK0605,371,It's so quiet here, as though there wasn't even a storm outside at all.
SK0605,372,Nobody's here. I'll go check another room.
SK0605,373,Smells nice in here, like soap. Kanna was in here not too long ago, right?
SK0605,374,I'd love to take a bath myself, but I'm on duty right now.
SK0605,375,It's just like a hospital at nighttime in here. Gives me the creeps.
SK0605,376,Nothing out of the ordinary here. I should get going.
SK0605,377,Nobody's here, and everything seems normal. Better get going.
SK0605,378,The steam process works nonstop, day and night.
SK0605,379,Totally unmoved by whatever racket's going on outside.
SK0605,380,Flower Division, all hands reporting for duty... Aside from Reni.
SK0605,381,The one who kidnapped Reni was most likely... Saki Kageyama.
SK0605,382,She's also the culprit behind Manager Yoneda's assassination attempt, and most likely a member of the Black Demons.
SK0605,383,Huh?! No... Saki?!
SK0605,384,So she was the spy all along, huh?!
SK0605,385,Knowing that, all of the Black Demon Society's moves up till now start to make sense.
SK0605,386,The arson at Fukagawa, the surprise attack during our vacation...
SK0605,387,They couldn't have done any of that if they weren't being fed information.
SK0605,388,So the one who shot Yoneda, and the one who just kidnapped Reni... It was Saki this whole time?!
SK0605,389,I can't believe Saki was a spy this whole time...
SK0605,390,Dammit! Those Black Demons fight dirty!
SK0605,391,We have to hurry and go after Reni.
SK0605,392,But first, is there anything you wanted to ask me, Ogami?
SK0605,393,Why did Saki take Reni?
SK0605,394,Where did you get the intel on Saki?
SK0605,395,Why did Saki take Reni?
SK0605,396,I think it might have something to do with Reni's past.
SK0605,397,Around the time of the Great War, a group of German scientists were conducting special research.
SK0605,398,The name of this project... was "Wachstum."
SK0605,399,A project with the aim of creating soldiers wielding perfect, enhanced spirit power.
SK0605,400,In the end, the project only saw a single survivor. That survivor... was Reni.
SK0605,401,As a part of "Wachstum", Reni had only one purpose: to become an elite fighting machine.
SK0605,402,All this to say, Reni grew up deprived of human contact and affection.
SK0605,403,Reni was taught nothing but how to fight during what were her most emotionally vulnerable years.
SK0605,404,I can't even begin to imagine just how lonely Reni must have felt...
SK0605,405,After the war ended, they managed to rescue Reni... but it was already too late.
SK0605,406,Reni's heart was frozen shut, cold as ice...
SK0605,407,Reni...
SK0605,408,Where did you get the intel on Saki?
SK0605,409,I asked a certain someone to investigate the matter.
SK0605,410,A certain someone? Who's that?
SK0605,411,...Sorry, but I can't tell you yet.
SK0605,412,Kaede...
SK0605,413,Right then. Everyone, let's split up and look for Reni.
SK0605,414,It's stormy out, so everyone form groups of two.
SK0605,415,Yes, ma'am!
SK0605,416,I'm coming with you, Mon Frère!
SK0605,417,I'm bringing Reni those flowers no matter what!
SK0605,418,All right, I understand.
SK0605,419,I'll be deploying with Iris. If any of you finds Reni, let us all know at once!
SK0605,420,Roger!
SK0605,421,All right, Ogami, give the order to move out!
SK0605,422,Imperial Assault Troupe, move out!
SK0605,423,We WILL save Reni!
SK0605,424,Imperial Assault Troupe, move out!
SK0605,425,Roger!
SK0605,426,We'll save Reni...
SK0605,427,No matter what it takes!
SK0605,428,All right, let's show 'em what the Flower Division is made of!
SK0605,429,I actually don't mind fighting in the middle of a typhoon.
SK0605,430,All right, let's go, everyone!
SK0605,431,Wait for us, Reni! We're coming to save you!
SK0605,432,Everyone, we WILL save Reni!
SK0605,433,Sir, yes, sir!
SK0605,434,Keep it together, Ogami! You're the captain, remember?!
SK0605,435,Now give the order!
SK0605,436,Reni! Where are you? Answer me!
SK0605,437,Reniiii! Reeeeeniiii! Where are you?!
SK0605,438,Iris, can you use your power to find out where Iris is?
SK0605,439,OK, I'll try.
SK0605,440,...
SK0605,441,Reni, where are you? If you can hear me, answer me!
SK0605,442,...!! Reni!
SK0605,443,What's wrong, Iris?
SK0605,444,Mon Frère, I can feel a super strong power coming from over there!
SK0605,445,Got it! Let's check it out!
SK0605,446,It'll be daybreak soon. Where are you, Reni?!
SK0605,447,Ah!! Mon Frère! Over there!
SK0605,448,Reni! Reni, are you all right?!
SK0605,449,...
SK0605,450,Reni...
SK0605,451,Heheheheheh. Reni's heart is already mine.
SK0605,452,Reni's my cute little puppet now. She'll make a great gift for our master, too.
SK0605,453,A souvenir of the return of Saki Kageyama; of Suiko, one of the Black Demon Society's Five Elements.
SK0605,454,Saki. I didn't want to believe you were truly Suiko.
SK0605,455,But if you really are the same Saki who was our friend, you'll stop this right now!
SK0605,456,It's not too late! Give Reni back, and go back to the Saki you used to be!
SK0605,457,Heheheh. Naive as ever.
SK0605,458,Reni. Those two are your enemies. Now kill them.
SK0605,459,...RO-GER.
SK0605,460,Heheheh. Well, Ogami? What will you do?
SK0605,461,Rrgh... How could you?!
SK0605,462,Mon Frère... What... What should I do?
SK0605,463,Go get the others.
SK0605,464,Come with me.
SK0605,465,Iris, go get the others!
SK0605,466,OK, got it!
SK0605,467,Mon Frère, please save Reni!
SK0605,468,I will. I'll talk to her.
SK0605,469,Reni asked me what it is I'm fighting for.
SK0605,470,I know my answer now. Just hold on, Reni!
SK0605,471,Come with me, Iris. I'll need your help, too
SK0605,472,OK, got it!
SK0605,473,Let's save Reni, Mon Frère!
SK0605,474,If you talk to her, I'm sure she'll come around!
SK0605,475,Reni asked me what it is I'm fighting for.
SK0605,476,I know my answer now. Just hold on, Reni!

SK0606,1,Why? Why won't you... fight me? I'm... your enemy!
SK0606,2,Reni, do not be deceived! You are a killing machine. Everyone else is your enemy!
SK0606,3,That's not true! Reni, you have to believe in others!
SK0606,4,Mon Frère, take this!
SK0606,5,What... is that?!
SK0606,6,Reni, you have to remember! Remember who you are! Remember who WE are!
SK0606,7,The time we first met... The days we spent together... Have you completely forgotten?
SK0606,8,Remember how Iris poured her heart into making this flower crown for you!
SK0606,9,Urgh...
SK0606,10,I didn't know how lost you felt, how anxious you felt, how lonely you felt...
SK0606,11,What am I fighting for?" When you asked me that question, I didn't know how to tell you.
SK0606,12,But now... Now I can tell you exactly how I feel!

SK0606,32,Tsch! You were nothing but a useless piece of junk after all.
SK0606,33,Very well. I'll kill you all myself! Come at me!
SK0606,34,I won't falter anymore. Thanks to the others, I finally know what I'm fighting for!

SK0607,1,A few days later...
SK0607,2,The Imperial Assault Troupe's autumn production, "The Bluebird", was a smash hit.
SK0607,3,Reni and Iris's perfectly-synchronized performances received rave reviews.
SK0607,4,Critics summed up "The Bluebird" thusly:
SK0607,5,In the final scene, you can genuinely feel the love between the two siblings as they find the bluebird."
SK0607,6,Tyltyl! The bluebird was in our room this whole time!

SK0701,1,Five Elements of the Black Demon Society... Only three sealed gates remain.
SK0701,2,And now our master himself is preparing to make his move.
SK0701,3,Fwohoho... Our master is truly a black moon in a dark night.
SK0701,4,The capital only prospers because it's brimming with wicked power.
SK0701,5,Who gives a damn about any of that?! We know where those bastards live! Gimme the order to move out!!
SK0701,6,They killed Suiko! I'll make 'em pay for what they've done!
SK0701,7,Fwohoho... You're quite feisty, Kongo. You'll be the next to die, at this rate.
SK0701,8,An idiot neglects their plans, but only a fool rushes to their death.
SK0701,9,Huh?!
SK0701,10,Hmph! Your emotions will only get you killed.
SK0701,11,What?!
SK0701,12,Suiko died because she couldn't cast her femininity aside. Heh... How pathetic.
SK0701,13,What did you say?!
SK0701,14,Silence Kongo, Tsuchigumo!
SK0701,15,I entrust our next operation to you, Kasha.
SK0701,16,Hmph. Very well. The capital, the Assault Troupe, my flames will reduce them all to ash.
SK0701,17,Heheheh. Nothing brings me joy quite like incinerating worthless garbage.
SK0701,18,...Don't get careless.
SK0701,19,It's human instinct to fear fire. You need not worry.
SK0701,20,Yaaaaay! Festival time, festival tiiiime!
SK0701,21,Iris, you'll get lost if you keep running off like that.
SK0701,22,But this is so much fun! Right, Reni?
SK0701,23,Y-Yeah.
SK0701,24,Yakisoba, ningyo-yaki, candied plums... Where do I even begin?!
SK0701,25,I swear, it's always food with you. How boorish.
SK0701,26,What's wrong with that? This festival only comes around once a year, y'know.
SK0701,27,Looks like they have a slide show set up here, too. I'm gonna enjoy myself today!
SK0701,28,Sheesh, everyone sure is cheerful.
SK0701,29,All right, Ogami, I'll be going with the others.
SK0701,30,The autumn festival... 
SK0701,31,Browse the stalls.
SK0701,32,Watch the slide show.
SK0701,33,Take a break.
SK0701,34,Let's see... Guess I'll browse the stalls.
SK0701,35,Mon Frèèèère!
SK0701,36,Iris? How are you enjoying the festival?
SK0701,37,It's super fun! There's so many kinds of stalls here!
SK0701,38,Really? I was just about to go browse them myself.
SK0701,39,Really?! Then you can come with me!
SK0701,40,C'mon, hurry, hurry!
SK0701,41,Hahaha, all right, let's go, then.
SK0701,42,Ahh, that was so much fun! Thanks, Mon Frère!
SK0701,43,I had a lot of fun too, seeing all those stalls.
SK0701,44,Uh-huh! We should bring Reni along next time!
SK0701,45,See you later, Mon Frère! Bye-bye!
SK0701,46,Hahaha, she ran around so much, and yet she's still full of energy.
SK0701,47,Right, what should I do next?
SK0701,48,I'm kinda tired now, but that was a lot of fun, Mon Frère.
SK0701,49,Yeah, there were so many different kinds of stalls.
SK0701,50,Uh-huh! We should bring Reni along next time!
SK0701,51,See you later, Mon Frère! Bye-bye!
SK0701,52,Right, what should I do next?
SK0701,53,Phew... I'm tired.
SK0701,54,I'm sorry, Iris. There were so many people around...
SK0701,55,No, it's all right. I know you tried your best for me.
SK0701,56,See you later, Mon Frère! Bye-bye!
SK0701,57,Right, what should I do next?
SK0701,58,All right, time for a-- ACHOO! Fun slide show! Everyone here? Good. Candy? OK, here ya go. Bathroom? Just hold it in, kid.
SK0701,59,*sniff* Sorry, I have a cold. Anyway, Masked Red! Lively and pure of heart, he is the ideal young man!
SK0701,60,Overcoming all manner of obstacles, today he... (No, ya have to pay for the candy, kid.) He rides forth once again!
SK0701,61,The brilliant scientist, Dr. Yukawa, has just invented a new weapon: the gamma-- ACHOO! Gamma bomb!
SK0701,62,The evil gentleman Skull X is-- ACHOO! (Sorry.) Skull X is after the blueprints, and sends out his iron robot, Sigma!
SK0701,63,Mwahaha! Dr. Yukawa! I, Skull X, have taken your daughter!"
SK0701,64,Fatheeeeeerrrrr!!"
SK0701,65,Ohhh, Masae! Won't some strapping young lad please save my daughter?!"
SK0701,66,But! Just then!
SK0701,67,VROOM! Brmbrmbrmbrm-- ACHOO! Brmbrmbrmbrm! (That's the noise the scooter makes, you see.)
SK0701,68,Straddling his trusty scooter, the Mach Red, the boy wonder makes his flashy entrance! [adlib unintelligible, music too loud]
SK0701,69,Masked Red, the one and only, is on the scene!
SK0701,70,Skull X! Unhand that girl!" [adlib unintelligible, music too loud]
SK0701,71,So you've finally arrived, Masked Red! Witness the power of my robot, Sigma!"
SK0701,72,BWOOOOM! Drdrdrdr...
SK0701,73,Red, look!!"
SK0701,74,Ah! The enemy robot!"
SK0701,75,Their surprise was perfectly understandable.
SK0701,76,Sigma, with Skull X and Masae in hand, had just shot up into the sky, leaving a trail of flames in its wake!
SK0701,77,The robot's plaACHOO! Platinum frame, lit up by searchlights, grows smaller and smaller in the night sky.
SK0701,78,Heheheh... Farewell, Masked Red, my boy!"
SK0701,79,REEEEEEED!"
SK0701,80,Masae! Curse you, Skull X! I'll never give up!"
SK0701,81,And so, Masked Red begins his pursu-- ACHOO! Pursuit of Sigma!
SK0701,82,What fate awakes-- er, no, AWAITS the kidnapped Masae?!
SK0701,83,...All right, that's enough for today. See you kids next time! Make sure to buy more candy! Later.
SK0701,84,I'm feeling kinda tired. I think I'll take a break.
SK0701,85,Spacing out with nothing to do, Ensign? What else is new?
SK0701,86,Hey, Orihime. What about you? How are you doing?
SK0701,87,Actually, I've got nothing to do, either.
SK0701,88,I see. Well, why don't we take a walk together, then?
SK0701,89,Spend time with YOU, Ensign? Hmmm, whatever shall I do?
SK0701,90,Well, I do have time to kill, so I'll let you accompany me, just this once.
SK0701,91,Now quit dawdling before I leave you behind.
SK0701,92,Ah! Orihime! Wait for me!
SK0701,93,Sheesh, same Orihime as ever...
SK0701,94,Well, Orihime? What do you think of Japanese festivals?
SK0701,95,Italian feste are hundreds, no, THOUSANDS of times grander in scale!
SK0701,96,They're far more elegant and passionate, too. Don't even think of comparing them.
SK0701,97,Well you don't have to put it like that... Let's just enjoy ourselves while we're here.
SK0701,98,Eh, I suppose I can find ways to pass the time here.
SK0701,99,Huh, looks like that man over there's got a stall set up.
SK0701,100,I think he might be a portrait artist!
SK0701,101,Welcome, miss. I can draw your portrait, if you'd like.
SK0701,102,Hmmm, I wonder how good this guy really is?
SK0701,103,Despite appearances, I'm not much of an artist, though I did study the craft in Italy.
SK0701,104,...Huh?
SK0701,105,A-Are you...? No, it can't be...
SK0701,106,...! I-Is that you? Orihime?!
SK0701,107,Is he an acquaintance of yours, Orihime?
SK0701,108,D-Don't be stupid!
SK0701,109,As if I would ever make the acquaintance of a Japanese man!
SK0701,110,But it sounded like you knew him.
SK0701,111,Shut up, both of you! If I say I don't know him, then I don't know him!
SK0701,112,Now my mood is ruined! I'm going home!
SK0701,113,Ah! O-Orihime, wait!!
SK0701,114,...Don't worry about me. Please, go after her.
SK0701,115,A-All right, I'll do that. Apologies for the commotion, sir. Excuse me.
SK0701,116,...
SK0701,117,Orihime...
SK0701,118,Sorry, Ogami, but each customer is only allowed to purchase one photo at a time.
SK0701,119,I see. That's too bad.
SK0701,120,So sorry, Ogami. I can only sell you one piece at a time to the same person.

SK0702,13,Yes. I made it yellow, your favorite color.
SK0702,14,Yes. I made it blue, your favorite color.
SK0702,15,I see. So that's why you asked me what color I liked.
SK0702,16,Yes, I knitted it little by little, so that you wouldn't notice.
SK0702,17,You almost caught me knitting it in my room one time; I was so nervous.

SK0702,29,Seeing you happy like this is more than enough.
SK0702,30,Thank you for accepting it.
SK0702,31,I'm so touched! I can't believe you'd knit a scarf, just for me!
SK0702,32,That's... kind of going overboard, Ogami.
SK0702,33,But I'm glad you're happy.
SK0702,34,Sakura...
SK0702,35,Ogami?
SK0702,36,Oh, s-sorry. This is just so sudden. I'm a little surprised, that's all.
SK0702,37,Will you take it, Ogami?
SK0702,38,Yes, it'd be my pleasure. Thank you, Sakura.
SK0702,39,I was so worried. I didn't know what I'd do if you didn't like it.
SK0702,40,I'm so glad I went through with it and gave it to you.
SK0702,41,Sakura...
SK0702,42,All right, Ogami, I should get going.
SK0702,43,Thank you for the scarf. I mean it.
SK0702,44,Of course! Please excuse me.

SK0702,47,My ticket-punching duties for our autumn production went smoothly, thanks to all the practice I got.
SK0702,48,I guess practice DOES make perfect, huh?
SK0702,49,Nobody here in the lobby.
SK0702,50,Oh well, better go somewhere else.
SK0702,51,Oh, Mr. Ogami! Welcome!
SK0702,52,Why not buy a photo while you're here?
SK0702,53,Oh, Mr. Ogami! Welcome!
SK0702,54,Buy a photo.
SK0702,55,Talk to Tsubomi.
SK0702,56,Leave.
SK0702,57,All right, I'll take a photo.
SK0702,58,Um, Mr. Ogami? I'm afraid I can only sell you one photo at a time.
SK0702,59,We have to leave some for the customers, I hope you understand.
SK0702,60,Buying a photo? Thank you very much!
SK0702,61,That's Sakura's photo.

SK0702,77,Oh, not buying a photo after all?
SK0702,78,How was running the shop last month during our autumn production?
SK0702,79,The customers just wouldn't stop coming! It was super hectic!
SK0702,80,So hectic I had to ask Yuri and Kasumi for help...
SK0702,81,We were so busy, my head started spinning!
SK0702,82,That makes sense. It was your first time running the shop during our performances.
SK0702,83,Tsubaki really is something else! I can't believe she can manage all that by herself!
SK0702,84,I'm not up to Tsubaki's level just yet...
SK0702,85,But while she's out, I'm gonna do my very best to keep this shop running!
SK0702,86,I see. Good luck, Tsubomi.
SK0702,87,Seeing you punch tickets during the fall production was truly breathtaking, Mr. Ogami!
SK0702,88,R-Really, now? Thanks.
SK0702,89,All right, I have to get going. Good luck with your work.
SK0702,90,Thanks for your patronage! Come again!
SK0702,91,Thanks for your patronage! Make sure to buy a photo next time!
SK0702,92,The dining hall was packed with patrons during our fall production last month.
SK0702,93,The theater's modern menu is apparently quite popular with our patrons.
SK0702,94,Hmm, nobody here. Oh well. Guess I'll go somewhere else.
SK0702,95,Oh, if it isn't Kanna.
SK0702,96,Yo, Boss! I was thinkin' about starting a bonfire in the courtyard with all the dead leaves.
SK0702,97,Heheh, you know what that means, right?
SK0702,98,Baked sweet potatoes?
SK0702,99,Grilled fish?
SK0702,100,Smoke signals?
SK0702,101,If we're lighting a bonfire in autumns, then it's gotta be baked sweet potatoes, right?
SK0702,102,Exactly! You're a sharp one, aren't you, Boss?
SK0702,103,A bonfire, huh? Are we gonna grill some fish?
SK0702,104,Ahaha, what are you talkin' about? A bonfire in the fall means we gotta bake sweet potatoes!
SK0702,105,R-Right. That's true.
SK0702,106,You plan on making smoke signals, right?
SK0702,107,Yeah, to reach my dad up in heaven...
SK0702,108,Kanna...
SK0702,109,Just kidding! Of course not.
SK0702,110,A bonfire in the fall means we gotta bake sweet potatoes!
SK0702,111,Seriously, though... You caught me off guard with that one.
SK0702,112,Well, I managed to stay one step ahead of you, at least.
SK0702,113,Too bad, time's up!
SK0702,114,If we're lighting a bonfire in the fall, then we gotta bake sweet potatoes!
SK0702,115,R-Right. That's true.
SK0702,116,You should head to the courtyard around 2:30.
SK0702,117,Sakura and Kohran both said they'd be there, so we can all share baked sweet potatoes together.
SK0702,118,All right, I'll swing by if I have time.
SK0702,119,Hey, Kanna. Getting the sweet potatoes ready?
SK0702,120,Yeah, I'm having trouble finding good ones, I'm still looking.
SK0702,121,Relax, though, I think I'll be able to find some in time for 2:30.
SK0702,122,Kanna's in the courtyard, right? I should swing by and see.
SK0702,123,Doesn't look like anyone's here.
SK0702,124,Oh well, guess I'll go somewhere else.
SK0702,125,The entrance here was jam packed during our autumn production last month.
SK0702,126,Now that I think of it, Navy Minister Yamaguchi came to see it too, right?
SK0702,127,We'll have to make sure our next show's also a good one that people will come to see in droves.
SK0702,128,Seems like no one's here. I'll check somewhere else.
SK0702,129,Oh, Ogami. Did you need something?
SK0702,130,You came for my spicy gossip, right?
SK0702,131,Oh, Ogami. Hello again.
SK0702,132,If it's gossip you're after, I'm all out at the moment. Sorry!
SK0702,133,I see. That's too bad.
SK0702,134,I'll have plenty stories for you later, so you can look forward to that!
SK0702,135,Hey, Yuri and Kasumi.
SK0702,136,Oh, Ogami. Did you need something?
SK0702,137,I've got a bunch of new gossip! I can tell you, if you want.
SK0702,138,Listen to gossip.
SK0702,139,Come back later.
SK0702,140,Sorry, I'm all out of rumors at the moment.
SK0702,141,I see. That's too bad.
SK0702,142,I'll have plenty stories for you later, so you can look forward to that!
SK0702,143,Everyone in the Flower Division's sure been working hard lately.
SK0702,144,Yeah, they've been busy both on stage and on the battlefield, but they've been doing well.
SK0702,145,I know some of them have been up late training.
SK0702,146,Huh? Who?
SK0702,147,Heehee, that's a secret!
SK0702,148,(Up late, huh? Who could that be?)
SK0702,149,The Bluebird" was amazing last month!
SK0702,150,I found Reni's performance as Tyltyl especially moving.
SK0702,151,I think Reni really resonated with Tyltyl searching for the bluebird.
SK0702,152,We got a ton of patrons, too, it was a huge hit!
SK0702,153,Oh yeah, that's right! I have a special scoop for you, Ogami.
SK0702,154,Mysterious torii gates have been spotted all over the capital! Isn't that crazy?
SK0702,155,Mysterious torii gates? What do you mean?
SK0702,156,There've been several cases of torii gates suddenly appearing at certain spots throughout the capital.
SK0702,157,The locals seem happy about them, going so far as to call them "good omens"...
SK0702,158,But who exactly built them? That's a lot of effort if it's all just a prank.
SK0702,159,Hmm... That is kind of concerning.
SK0702,160,That reminds me, how was the autumn festival, Ogami?
SK0702,161,...Good. It was pretty lively, and there were lots of stalls set up.
SK0702,162,Wow, that sounds nice. Wish I could've gone.
SK0702,163,Hm hm, I'm afraid that's just how it is, Yuri.
SK0702,164,We can't exactly leave our posts when it's so busy around here.
SK0702,165,Yeah, I know. What a bore...
SK0702,166,That's too bad. Well, I'm sure you'll be able to make the next one.
SK0702,167,That reminds me, Reni's looking a lot happier these days.
SK0702,168,You're right. She's even started properly greeting me.
SK0702,169,People really can change, can't they?
SK0702,170,Hm hm, that's true.
SK0702,171,The mornings and evenings have gotten pretty chilly lately.
SK0702,172,Our autumn production was a huge success.
SK0702,173,Now the only performance left for this year is our Christmas play.
SK0702,174,We'll have to start getting ready ourselves, soon.
SK0702,175,Now that Reni's cheered up, Orihime's the only one left giving you problems, right?
SK0702,176,Uh, hmm... I guess so, yeah.
SK0702,177,She still hates Japanese men, doesn't she?
SK0702,178,...Yeah. Still don't know why, either.
SK0702,179,Hey, Ogami, do you know about the violinist spotted around town?
SK0702,180,Violinist?
SK0702,181,Yes, I saw him myself on my way home from shopping.
SK0702,182,He sings satirical songs about the state of the world, he's quite interesting.
SK0702,183,I see. Maybe I'll give him a listen when I have the chance.
SK0702,184,Would you like me to give you Tsubaki's number, Ogami?
SK0702,185,Huh?! You know it?
SK0702,186,Yes, she's been given her own transceiver for emergency contact.
SK0702,187,Tsubaki's number is: 13600.
SK0702,188,13600... There, I wrote it down.
SK0702,189,Try giving her a call every now and then, OK?
SK0702,190,I'll be back. Good luck with the rest of your work.
SK0702,191,OK. Thanks for coming, Ogami.
SK0702,192,Tell us if you hear any juicy stories!
SK0702,193,I wonder if the manager's in...
SK0702,194,Guess I'll go somewhere else.
SK0702,195,Are you there, sir? It's Ogami.
SK0702,196,...
SK0702,197,Huh? Doesn't sound like he's there.
SK0702,198,Are you there, sir? It's Ogami.
SK0702,199,...
SK0702,200,Guess he's not in. He must still be in the war room.
SK0702,201,I thought I might find Orihime here.
SK0702,202,Guess she's in her room.
SK0702,203,Orihime's not here.
SK0702,204,Oh well. Guess I'll check somewhere else.
SK0702,205,The costumes played a huge role in our autumn production's success.
SK0702,206,I wonder how many costumes are in here, anyway.
SK0702,207,Hmmm... Nobody's here, eh?
SK0702,208,Oh well. Guess I'll go somewhere else.
SK0702,209,Rehearsals are done for the day, so nobody's backstage.
SK0702,210,No use sticking around here. Might as well go elsewhere.
SK0702,211,Thought I'd come here a little later, but still no one around.
SK0702,212,Oh well. I'll try another room.
SK0702,213,Oh, Ogami...
SK0702,214,Thanks for earlier, Sakura.
SK0702,215,D-Don't mention it...
SK0702,216,What on earth is he talking about, Sakura?
SK0702,217,N-Nothing! Nothing at all!
SK0702,218,B-By the way, what are you two up to?
SK0702,219,Oh, Ogami.
SK0702,220,Oh my, Ensign. It's quite unusual to see you here.
SK0702,221,What are you two doing here?
SK0702,222,We were just talking about Reni.
SK0702,223,She put on such a wonderful performance last month.
SK0702,224,More importantly, she's so much more cheerful than before.
SK0702,225,That's really great.
SK0702,226,This is only the beginning.
SK0702,227,She's cute when she smiles.
SK0702,228,That's really great. Reni's finally opened up.
SK0702,229,Now she can be a real member of the Flower Division.
SK0702,230,Yes, I think so too. I hope we can keep getting along like this.
SK0702,231,Indeed, it's wonderful to see.
SK0702,232,This is only the beginning. Reni's locked her emotions away for a long time, after all.
SK0702,233,She's only just begun to open that door herself.
SK0702,234,We have to be there for her and keep supporting her from here on out.
SK0702,235,I think you might be right, Ensign.
SK0702,236,Considering all she's been through, there's no way her heart could heal in just a single day.
SK0702,237,Right. We'll need to keep doing our best, then, for her sake.
SK0702,238,I was just thinking... Reni's pretty cute when she smiles.
SK0702,239,Ensign, while I certainly don't object to Reni being called "cute"...
SK0702,240,We were having a more serious discussion. Please refrain from making jokes.
SK0702,241,She's right, Ogami.
SK0702,242,You've been saying that sort of thing a lot lately, haven't you?
SK0702,243,There's a time and place for making jokes.
SK0702,244,Oh... S-Sorry. I guess I overdid it a little.
SK0702,245,...
SK0702,246,What's the matter, Ensign?
SK0702,247,Perhaps you're worried about Orihime?
SK0702,248,True, you two don't seem to get along very well.
SK0702,249,But Reni opened up to us.
SK0702,250,I'm sure Orihime will open up to you too, someday.
SK0702,251,Hmmm...
SK0702,252,Anyway, I let Reni have the lead role this time.
SK0702,253,But next time, I shall be the star! Ohohohoho!
SK0702,254,You sure are fired up, Sumire!
SK0702,255,So we're meeting at the stage tonight to rehearse, then, as usual?
SK0702,256,S-Sakura! I thought you promised not to tell anyone!
SK0702,257,Oh! S-Sorry! It just slipped out...
SK0702,258,Honestly, I swear... Ensign, forget everything you just heard from her.
SK0702,259,And with that, I must be going.
SK0702,260,Oh, that's right. I'll be waiting for you in the salon, Ensign.
SK0702,261,And I'll be waiting for you in the courtyard from 2:30 onward. Now, please excuse me.
SK0702,262,...
SK0702,263,Everyone was really worried about Reni, huh.
SK0702,264,Looks like rehearsals are over for today.
SK0702,265,Right, I should head somewhere else.
SK0702,266,The fantastical sets in "The Bluebird" were the subject of much praise.
SK0702,267,The power of set design truly cannot be understated.
SK0702,268,Hmmm... Nobody's here, eh?
SK0702,269,Well, nobody really comes here without a good reason, anyway.
SK0702,270,Rehearsals are done for today and nobody's on stage.
SK0702,271,Guess I'll get going, then.
SK0702,272,On top of being a big hit, "The Bluebird" was Reni's first starring role here at the theater.
SK0702,273,Leave it to the Flower Division to pack the seats in both the summer and fall.
SK0702,274,Doesn't look like any of the others are here.
SK0702,275,Oh well. Guess I'll go somewhere else.
SK0702,276,Oh, there's Reni. Hey, Reni!
SK0702,277,...Captain.
SK0702,278,And the other should be here any second now...
SK0702,279,Arf arf arf!
SK0702,280,Dog value change. Change change change. Assign assign assign... [system text]
SK0702,281,There he is. Over here, Shiro!
SK0702,282,There he is. Over here, Hanamaru!
SK0702,283,There he is. Over here, Dai!
SK0702,284,There he is. Over here, Torte!
SK0702,285,There he is. Over here, Long!
SK0702,286,There he is. Over here, Altair!
SK0702,287,There he is. Over here, Hund!
SK0702,288,Arf arf!
SK0702,289,...
SK0702,290,Reni...
SK0702,291,Look, Reni, Shiro wants to play. He wants to be friends with you.
SK0702,292,Look, Reni, Hanamaru wants to play. He wants to be friends with you.
SK0702,293,Look, Reni, Dai wants to play. He wants to be friends with you.
SK0702,294,Look, Reni, Torte wants to play. He wants to be friends with you.
SK0702,295,Look, Reni, Long wants to play. He wants to be friends with you.
SK0702,296,Look, Reni, Altair wants to play. He wants to be friends with you.
SK0702,297,Look, Reni, Hund wants to play. He wants to be friends with you.
SK0702,298,...
SK0702,299,With the way you are now, I'm sure you can reciprocate Shiro's feelings.
SK0702,300,With the way you are now, I'm sure you can reciprocate Hanamaru's feelings.
SK0702,301,With the way you are now, I'm sure you can reciprocate Dai's feelings.
SK0702,302,With the way you are now, I'm sure you can reciprocate Torte's feelings.
SK0702,303,With the way you are now, I'm sure you can reciprocate Long's feelings.
SK0702,304,With the way you are now, I'm sure you can reciprocate Altair's feelings.
SK0702,305,With the way you are now, I'm sure you can reciprocate Hund's feelings.
SK0702,306,C'mon, Reni. Try playing with him.
SK0702,307,C'mon, Reni. Try playing with him.
SK0702,308,C'mon, Reni. Try playing with him.
SK0702,309,C'mon, Reni. Try playing with him.
SK0702,310,C'mon, Reni. Try playing with him.
SK0702,311,C'mon, Reni. Try playing with him.
SK0702,312,C'mon, Reni. Try playing with him.
SK0702,313,C'mon, Reni. Try playing with him.
SK0702,314,...
SK0702,315,...OK.
SK0702,316,Shiro...
SK0702,317,Hanamaru...
SK0702,318,Dai...
SK0702,319,Torte...
SK0702,320,Long...
SK0702,321,Altair...
SK0702,322,Hund...
SK0702,323,Arf arf arf!
SK0702,324,Your eyes are so gentle, and your body is so warm...
SK0702,325,Woof!
SK0702,326,Does this mean... you accept me the way I am?
SK0702,327,Arf arf!
SK0702,328,Hahaha! I'm pretty sure that means "of course I do"!
SK0702,329,...Thank you, Shiro.
SK0702,330,...Thank you, Hanamaru.
SK0702,331,...Thank you, Dai.
SK0702,332,...Thank you, Torte.
SK0702,333,...Thank you, Long.
SK0702,334,...Thank you, Altair.
SK0702,335,...Thank you, Hund.
SK0702,336,...
SK0702,337,Shiro really trusts you now. Isn't that great, Reni?
SK0702,338,Hanamaru really trusts you now. Isn't that great, Reni?
SK0702,339,Dai really trusts you now. Isn't that great, Reni?
SK0702,340,Torte really trusts you now. Isn't that great, Reni?
SK0702,341,Long really trusts you now. Isn't that great, Reni?
SK0702,342,Altair really trusts you now. Isn't that great, Reni?
SK0702,343,Hund really trusts you now. Isn't that great, Reni?
SK0702,344,He's accepted you as his friend.
SK0702,345,Yeah... Thank you, Captain.
SK0702,346,Oh, looks like everyone's started on the bonfire.
SK0702,347,Arf arf!
SK0702,348,Hahaha...
SK0702,349,[dog] is with you too, I see.
SK0702,350,Hey, Boss. Drawn by the smell of sweet potatoes, eh?
SK0702,351,We were just talking about your grilled fish thing from earlier.
SK0702,352,Thinking about fish before sweet potatoes sounds pretty fitting for you, coming from the Navy.
SK0702,353,Good grief, didn't think that'd spark a whole conversation.
SK0702,354,We were just talking about your smoke signal thing from earlier.
SK0702,355,Trying to make smoke signals from a bonfire like this? You're hilarious, Chief!
SK0702,356,Good grief, didn't think that'd spark a whole conversation.
SK0702,357,So, we're right in the middle of autumn now.
SK0702,358,In Japan, they say "fall is for something-or-other"... What is fall to you, Chief?
SK0702,359,"Fall is for reading."
SK0702,360,"Fall is for the arts."
SK0702,361,"Fall is for sports."
SK0702,362,Hmmm, I guess "fall is for reading", in my case.
SK0702,363,Ooh, nice, Chief! I'd say the same thing.
SK0702,364,Though I guess in my case, it's more like "fall is for inventing."
SK0702,365,So that includes inventing phrases, too, huh? You're hopeless.
SK0702,366,Hmmm, I guess "fall is for the arts", in my case.
SK0702,367,That's true, I feel like I can really throw myself into my rehearsals at this time of year.
SK0702,368,What arts do you practice, Chief? Doesn't really sound like your thing.
SK0702,369,Hmmm, I guess "fall is for sports", in my case.
SK0702,370,Right? Right? Ya gotta get your blood pumping in the fall!
SK0702,371,CHESTOHHHH! All right, who's down for a quick spar?!
SK0702,372,K-Kanna, please mind the bonfire.
SK0702,373,Hmmm... I don't know what I'd say.
SK0702,374,Oh! Looks like the sweet potatoes are just about ready.
SK0702,375,You're right!
SK0702,376,They look tasty!
SK0702,377,All right, everyone, dig in!
SK0702,378,Arf arf!
SK0702,379,I guess in our case, "fall is for eating", huh?
SK0702,380,Heehee, you're right! Now let's eat.
SK0702,381,Phew, nothing like a sweet potato cooked over a bonfire.
SK0702,382,Well, I'm stuffed now. I'd better get going.
SK0702,383,Looks like everyone's chitchatting while gathered around the fire.
SK0702,384,I'd get too distracted if I joined in. I'll just go somewhere else.
SK0702,385,The bonfire in the courtyard's starting at 2:30, right?
SK0702,386,Looks like I'm a little too early. I'll come back a bit later.
SK0702,387,All the leaves on the trees in the courtyard have fallen. Fall is really here.
SK0702,388,In just two months, the whole year will be over.
SK0702,389,Oh, if it ain't the Chief.
SK0702,390,Hey Kohran. What are you up to?
SK0702,391,Reni's gonna do some diving training in the pool starting at 2:30.
SK0702,392,I actually just got back from dropping off some custom-made training equipment for her.
SK0702,393,As for me, though, I'll be in the courtyard at 2:30 with Sakura and Kanna, lighting up a bonfire.
SK0702,394,I see. How seasonally appropriate.
SK0702,395,Right? Heheh, you can come if ya want, Chief.
SK0702,396,Sure, I'll be there.
SK0702,397,I'm kinda busy...
SK0702,398,Sure, I'll go.
SK0702,399,I'm kinda busy...
SK0702,400,Say, what's with the outfit?
SK0702,401,Sure, I'll go. It's been ages since I've lit a bonfire.
SK0702,402,That's the spirit, Chief!
SK0702,403,I'm sure you're busy, though, so you don't have to come if you can't make it.
SK0702,404,Just pop your head in if you got the time. Well, see ya, Chief.
SK0702,405,A bonfire, huh? Sounds kinda fun.
SK0702,406,I'll drop by for a bit, if I can make it.
SK0702,407,Hm... I'm kinda busy right now...
SK0702,408,I understand. I won't force you to come if you're busy.
SK0702,409,Stop on by if you got the time, though. All right, see ya, Chief.
SK0702,410,A bonfire, huh? Sounds kinda fun.
SK0702,411,I'll drop by for a bit, if I can make it.
SK0702,412,Say, what's with that outfit? It's different from what you usually wear.
SK0702,413,Heheh, just a seasonal change of clothes. It's gotten pretty cold out.
SK0702,414,Well, Chief? Do you... like it?
SK0702,415,It looks great on you.
SK0702,416,You look like a boy.
SK0702,417,I like your usual outfit better.
SK0702,418,It looks great on you, Kohran.
SK0702,419,For real, Chief?
SK0702,420,Yeah, seriously. I think you look good in it.
SK0702,421,Thanks a bunch, Chief. I'm super glad to hear it.
SK0702,422,I was actually kinda worried about what you'd say, but I'm glad I wore it after all.
SK0702,423,Hahaha, seriously, though, it looks great.
SK0702,424,...All right, Chief, I oughta get going.
SK0702,425,Thanks for the compliment.
SK0702,426,I didn't think she'd be that happy about it.
SK0702,427,Well, I should get going too.
SK0702,428,Umm... You kinda look like a boy.
SK0702,429,I guess that's true... I'm not super pretty like the other girls in the Flower Division.
SK0702,430,But when it comes to sheer moxie, nobody's got me beat!
SK0702,431,...Though I guess that's kinda boyish of me, too, huh? Ahahahaha!
SK0702,432,Well, I think it's a nice outfit. It suits you.
SK0702,433,Thanks a bunch, Chief. I like it, too.
SK0702,434,I think it's perfect for me the way I am.
SK0702,435,...All right, Chief, I oughta get going.
SK0702,436,Come swing by the courtyard later if you got the time.
SK0702,437,It's not her usual cheongsam, but she doesn't look bad dressed like that, either.
SK0702,438,A seasonal change, huh? Winter's right around the corner.
SK0702,439,Hmm, if I had to choose... I think I like your usual outfit better.
SK0702,440,So you don't like it, huh...
SK0702,441,S-Sorry...
SK0702,442,Eh, it's fine... I hate lies just like I hate natto, after all.
SK0702,443,I'd rather you tell me the truth than try to flatter me.
SK0702,444,...Well, see ya, Chief. Come by the courtyard later if you got time.
SK0702,445,Kohran took that well, but I think I might've gone a little too far.
SK0702,446,Oh well, too late to regret it now. I should go, too.
SK0702,447,What's with the long pause, Chief?
SK0702,448,S-Sorry, I was, uh, trying to think of what to say.
SK0702,449,If you like it, just say you like it. If you don't, say you don't.
SK0702,450,You really are as wishy-washy as ever.
SK0702,451,S-Sorry...
SK0702,452,...Eh, that's part of what makes you you, though.
SK0702,453,...Well, see ya, Chief. Come by the courtyard later if you got time.
SK0702,454,Actually, all the others have changed their outfits too, huh? We're right in the middle of autumn.
SK0702,455,Right, I should get going. I'll stop by the courtyard if I have the time.
SK0702,456,What's up, Chief? You look out of it.
SK0702,457,Oh, s-sorry, I just got lost in thought.
SK0702,458,I should be the one apologizing, bothering you while you're so busy.
SK0702,459,Well, see ya, Chief. Stop by the courtyard later if you got time.
SK0702,460,Well, I should get going too.
SK0702,461,Maybe I'll drop by the courtyard later if I have time.
SK0702,462,3 o'clock already, huh?
SK0702,463,I can't just keep ignoring Orihime.
SK0702,464,OK, I'll head to her room and have a talk with her.
SK0702,465,Oh, Captain.
SK0702,466,Hey, Reni. What are you up to?
SK0702,467,I like to come up here sometimes and look at the city.
SK0702,468,But it feels different today...
SK0702,469,I feel... calm, somehow. I've never felt this way before.
SK0702,470,Reni...
SK0702,471,It's because the seasons have changed.
SK0702,472,It's because you've changed.
SK0702,473,It must be because the seasons have changed.
SK0702,474,You can see the signs of fall all over the capital.
SK0702,475,Can't you feel it in the autumn breeze?
SK0702,476,I guess so... Seasons are simply a natural phenomenon, though.
SK0702,477,Well, we're not gonna get our answer out here. Let's head back inside.
SK0702,478,...OK.
SK0702,479,It must be because you've changed.
SK0702,480,...I have?
SK0702,481,This is the city we live in...
SK0702,482,A city full of important things we're sworn to protect.
SK0702,483,You may not have thought of it that way before...
SK0702,484,But your perspective must be changing, little by little.
SK0702,485,...
SK0702,486,There's no rush, you can take all the time you need to find the answers.
SK0702,487,I know you can find them, Reni.
SK0702,488,Captain...
SK0702,489,All right, you'll catch a cold if you stay out here too long. Let's head back inside.
SK0702,490,...OK.
SK0702,491,I'm not sure why you feel that way, either.
SK0702,492,I'm sure you'll figure it out on your own.
SK0702,493,...
SK0702,494,There's no rush, Reni, you can take your time to find the answers.
SK0702,495,I know you can find them.
SK0702,496,Captain...
SK0702,497,All right, you'll catch a cold if you stay out here too long. Let's head back inside.
SK0702,498,...OK.
SK0702,499,Fall is in the air in the capital...
SK0702,500,Only two months left before the year is over. So long yet so short at the same time...
SK0702,501,The hall here was packed with patrons for our autumn production last month.
SK0702,502,The Flower Division's popularity truly is something to behold.
SK0702,503,It's so quiet, as though the fervor around last month's performance never happened.
SK0702,504,Nobody's here, so I should head to another room.
SK0702,505,Ensign, I've been waiting for you.
SK0702,506,Thought I'd ask you for another tea brewing lesson, Sumire.
SK0702,507,Oh, I won't be teaching you today, Ensign.
SK0702,508,I'll be testing you on just how delicious you can make tea.
SK0702,509,Huh?! This is way too soon.
SK0702,510,Nonsense. There is such a thing as talent, you know.
SK0702,511,If you have the talent, then I know you can do it.
SK0702,512,And if you can't, well, that means you have no talent.
SK0702,513,Hmmm... Guess I don't have a choice, then.
SK0702,514,All right, Sumire, I'll give it a shot.
SK0702,515,Then let us begin. I have prepared here the tea and hot water.
SK0702,516,Now, Ensign, what do you do?
SK0702,517,(I'm pretty sure I'm supposed to heat the cup first, right?)
SK0702,518,Pour the tea.
SK0702,519,Pour the hot water.
SK0702,520,Pour the tea.
SK0702,521,Pour the hot water.
SK0702,522,For starters, you pour the tea into the cup.
SK0702,523,Ensign, have you forgotten already?
SK0702,524,You warm the cup first by pouring hot water into it.
SK0702,525,It's the very first thing I taught you, the most fundamental of fundamentals.
SK0702,526,Oh, right. I totally forgot.
SK0702,527,You wait a little bit, then pour the tea.
SK0702,528,Ensign, have you forgotten already?
SK0702,529,You warm the cup first by pouring hot water into it.
SK0702,530,It's the very first thing I taught you, the most fundamental of fundamentals.
SK0702,531,Oh, right. I totally forgot.
SK0702,532,You wait a little bit, then pour the hot water.
SK0702,533,Ensign, have you forgotten already?
SK0702,534,You warm the cup first by pouring hot water into it.
SK0702,535,You were doing it in the correct order, but you took a little too long.
SK0702,536,Oh, right. I totally forgot.
SK0702,537,Uh... What do I do, again?
SK0702,538,Ensign, have you forgotten already?
SK0702,539,You warm the cup first by pouring hot water into it.
SK0702,540,It's the very first thing I taught you, the most fundamental of fundamentals.
SK0702,541,Oh, right. I totally forgot.
SK0702,542,First, you pour the hot water into the cup to warm it.
SK0702,543,Then you wait a little bit until the tea leaves have open, then you pour the tea.
SK0702,544,...
SK0702,545,There's a trick to pouring it, too.
SK0702,546,Pour it quickly.
SK0702,547,Pour it slowly.
SK0702,548,Pour it out to the last drop.
SK0702,549,(Let's try pouring it quickly)
SK0702,550,Oh, Ensign, what a shame. You were so close.
SK0702,551,For black tea, you have to gradually pour it out till the very last drop.
SK0702,552,I taught you about the final "Golden Drop", remember?
SK0702,553,Oh, that's right. I totally forgot.
SK0702,554,(OK, I'll pour it out slowly.)
SK0702,555,That's far too slow, Ensign.
SK0702,556,If you pour it out that slowly, the tea will be far too bitter by the end.
SK0702,557,O-Oh. Looks like I messed up.
SK0702,558,Ensign! If you wait too long, the tea will become bitter!
SK0702,559,Oh, it's too late, now. What a shame.
SK0702,560,O-Oh. Looks like I messed up.
SK0702,561,(You carefully pour it all to the very last drop.)
SK0702,562,...
SK0702,563,OK, that's all of it!
SK0702,564,Sumire, would you like to try the tea I've prepared?
SK0702,565,Excellent, Ensign. Your brewing technique is flawless.
SK0702,566,Now to see just how much of your heart you've poured into it.
SK0702,567,Let's have a taste.
SK0702,568,...
SK0702,569,...
SK0702,570,...My! It's so delicious!
SK0702,571,Your impeccable technique has truly drawn out the flavor and aroma.
SK0702,572,But more importantly, I simply feel happy while drinking it.
SK0702,573,Huh, I wonder why that is.
SK0702,574,It must be because you prepared this tea with love.
SK0702,575,A cup of black tea, prepared by you, just for me... The only one of its kind in the entire world.
SK0702,576,I will never forget the taste of this tea for as long as I live.
SK0702,577,Sumire...
SK0702,578,Thank you, Ensign.
SK0702,579,It seems I have nothing left to teach you about making tea.
SK0702,580,I'm glad I could make you happy.
SK0702,581,Well then, I have to go. Take it easy, Sumire.
SK0702,582,Good day, Ensign. Thank you for the delicious tea.
SK0702,583,I guess I just don't have the talent for this after all...
SK0702,584,...
SK0702,585,Like I said at the beginning, talent is important, obviously.
SK0702,586,But I never overlook effort, either.
SK0702,587,I know how much effort you've put into this over the past few months.
SK0702,588,Besides, this tea had a rather unique taste to it.
SK0702,589,I'd say this was a good first step. You passed the test, Ensign.
SK0702,590,Sumire... Thank you.
SK0702,591,Well then, I have to go. Take it easy, Sumire.
SK0702,592,Take care, Ensign.
SK0702,593,Oh, Sumire's here.
SK0702,594,Oh, Ensign.
SK0702,595,I just passed by Orihime a short while ago.
SK0702,596,She seemed quite upset about something.
SK0702,597,What on earth happened to her?
SK0702,598,...
SK0702,599,Tell her about what happened.
SK0702,600,Actually, she's been like that ever since the festival.
SK0702,601,She ran straight home after we talked to a portrait artist there.
SK0702,602,It seemed like he knew her, too. I wonder what that was all about?
SK0702,603,Is that truly what happened?
SK0702,604,That being said...
SK0702,605,I can't say I approve of you speaking about other people's private matters unprompted.
SK0702,606,Y-You're right, sorry. That was careless of me.
SK0702,607,At any rate, it seems like it's your time to shine, Ensign.
SK0702,608,Please help Orihime.
SK0702,609,Guess Sumire does worry about the others after all.
SK0702,610,All right, I'd better get going.
SK0702,611,...
SK0702,612,I'm a little concerned, but this IS Orihime we're talking about. I suppose there's no need to worry.
SK0702,613,Besides, I'm sure you can help her with whatever her problem is.
SK0702,614,Now then, I was in the middle of making myself some tea, so if you'd please excuse me.
SK0702,615,Hmm... Something's definitely bugging Orihime.
SK0702,616,I'll have to head to her room sometime later.
SK0702,617,Sumire's still enjoying her tea, I see.
SK0702,618,I don't want to bother her, so I'll back off.
SK0702,619,I thought I might find someone here, but I guess not.
SK0702,620,Oh well. I'll try another room.
SK0702,621,Guess it's not time for Sumire's tea lessons yet. I'll come back later.
SK0702,622,Think you'll let me win at billiards today, Maria?
SK0702,623,Hm hm, you have improved a lot, Captain, that much is true.
SK0702,624,Well then, let's begin. Go easy on me, Captain.
SK0702,625,It's your turn, Captain. You're in a tough spot.
SK0702,626,Shoot... The next ball's totally blocked off.
SK0702,627,If I get a foul now, I'll lose. Hmm...
SK0702,628,(Maybe if I tried that jump shot Maria showed me back then...)
SK0702,629,Attempt a jump shot.
SK0702,630,Give up.
SK0702,631,Nope, can't do it. This is way beyond me.
SK0702,632,Getting a foul would end me, too, so I'll just give up.
SK0702,633,...
SK0702,634,No amount of thinking about it will change the fact that I can't do it.
SK0702,635,Getting a foul would end me, too, so I'll just give up.
SK0702,636,...
SK0702,637,So that's yet another loss, huh? Being stuck with a foul there really hurt.
SK0702,638,Seems your luck ran out.
SK0702,639,In the end, I couldn't beat you.
SK0702,640,But you've still improved a lot, sir.
SK0702,641,I hadn't played billiards in a long time, myself, so this was quite fun for me.
SK0702,642,Thanks, Maria. All right, I should get going, then.
SK0702,643,OK. Good work, Captain.
SK0702,644,All right... I'm gonna try a jump shot.
SK0702,645,Huh?! Captain, I don't think you're ready yet.
SK0702,646,It's true, it might be too hard for me at my current skill level...
SK0702,647,But so long as there's a chance, I want to at least try.
SK0702,648,I can give up whenever I want, after all.
SK0702,649,Captain...
SK0702,650,Right, here goes. 1... 2...
SK0702,651,There!
SK0702,652,Gwargh!!
SK0702,653,C-Captain!!
SK0702,654,Ow... My forehead...
SK0702,655,Captain! Are you all right?!
SK0702,656,Not... really... No...
SK0702,657,Ow ow ow... That stings.
SK0702,658,Please stay still, sir.
SK0702,659,I can't believe I hit myself on the head instead of the ball I was aiming for.
SK0702,660,...
SK0702,661,But you faced the challenge head-on till the very end, and I think that's wonderful.
SK0702,662,Come to think of it, you've always managed to turn the tables, no matter the odds, without ever giving up.
SK0702,663,You have a strong heart, able to face seemingly impossible challenges without backing down.
SK0702,664,I feel like... I'm the one who learned something today.
SK0702,665,Maria...
SK0702,666,Still, it was pretty reckless of you to attempt a jump shot.
SK0702,667,You didn't need to say that part, Maria...
SK0702,668,There, all done with first aid, Captain.
SK0702,669,Thanks, Maria.
SK0702,670,I wasn't able to beat you in the end, but it still made for some good memories.
SK0702,671,Yes. I always looked forward to our trips to the game room these past three months.
SK0702,672,If you ever have the chance, you should challenge me again sometime. All right, I have to go now.
SK0702,673,Never giving up till the very end, huh...?
SK0702,674,Well, my forehead's mostly stopped hurting, so I think I'll get going too.
SK0702,675,Maria taught me billiards in here these past three months.
SK0702,676,I wasn't able to beat her in the end, but we made some good memories.
SK0702,677,Nobody's here.
SK0702,678,Oh well, I'll check another room.
SK0702,679,Phew... Nothing calms you down like sitting in your own room.
SK0702,680,OK, what to do next?
SK0702,681,Call someone.
SK0702,682,Go somewhere else.
SK0702,683,Yeah, I think I'll take a break and call someone.
SK0702,684,I think I'll go somewhere else.
SK0702,685,OK, who to call?
SK0702,686,Hello? This is Tsubaki Takamura.
SK0702,687,Hey, Tsubaki? It's me, Ogami.
SK0702,688,Huh? Ogami! How'd you get my number?
SK0702,689,Yuri told me, actually.
SK0702,690,Oh, I see! I'm just a little surprised, getting called out of the blue like this.
SK0702,691,I just kept trying numbers till I found it.
SK0702,692,Really? Well thanks for going through all that trouble!
SK0702,693,OK, let's talk on the big screen!
SK0702,694,Wow, I can see you so clearly!
SK0702,695,Yeah, I can see you well on this end, too.
SK0702,696,Really? This feels kind of different from our chats at the shop.
SK0702,697,By the way, Ogami, did you need something from me?
SK0702,698,Tell her "good luck."
SK0702,699,Ask what she's doing.
SK0702,700,Ask her out on a date.
SK0702,701,I won't ask you what you're doing, but good luck all the same, Tsubaki.
SK0702,702,Y-Yes, sir! Thank you!
SK0702,703,I can't tell you what I'm working on, due to the nature of this assignment...
SK0702,704,But with you cheering me on, I know I'll do my best!
SK0702,705,I know I've asked this before, but... what exactly are you up to?
SK0702,706,I'm sorry. I can't tell you, not under any circumstances.
SK0702,707,I see.
SK0702,708,...
SK0702,709,All right, Ogami, how about this? I'll tell you where I am, but that's it.
SK0702,710,Right now, I'm at the Imperial Assault Troupe's Hokkaido Headquarters.
SK0702,711,Huh? Hokkaido?!
SK0702,712,Yes. I can't say any more than that. Sorry.
SK0702,713,Tsubaki, when you get back, how about we go on a date?
SK0702,714,Huh? Are you serious, Ogami?
SK0702,715,OK, once I get back, I'll make sure to invite you out, then!
SK0702,716,No, nothing in particular. I just wanted to talk to you.
SK0702,717,O-Ogami...
SK0702,718,...
SK0702,719,...
SK0702,720,I... Um... I should go, got work to do, bye!
SK0702,721,Ah! Tsubaki!
SK0702,722,*sigh* She hung up.
SK0702,723,At any rate, I wonder where she is and what she's doing?
SK0702,724,All right, Ogami, I'm in the middle of work, so I have to go.
SK0702,725,Tell everyone at the theater I said hi!
SK0702,726,Sure. Good luck with your work!
SK0702,727,Thank you! Call me again sometime!
SK0702,728,Tsubaki really is working her hardest, isn't she.
SK0702,729,But still, I wonder what's she's doing over there?
SK0702,730,Hello? This is Tsubaki Takamura.
SK0702,731,Hello, this is Ogami.
SK0702,732,Oh, Ogami! You called again!
SK0702,733,OK, let's switch to the big screen.
SK0702,734,Hey Tsubaki, how goes work?
SK0702,735,Apparently my job here is almost done.
SK0702,736,Your temporary replacement, Tsubomi, has been working pretty hard, too.
SK0702,737,Really? I'd love to speak with her once I get back.
SK0702,738,Um, what kind of girl is Tsubomi, anyway?
SK0702,739,She's a go-getter.
SK0702,740,She's a klutz.
SK0702,741,She's a cutie.
SK0702,742,She's a real go-getter, if nothing else.
SK0702,743,Really? That's a relief.
SK0702,744,No matter the job, a hard worker will give it their all.
SK0702,745,If she tries her hardest, then I'm sure the customers will recognize that.
SK0702,746,She's cheerful, but kind of a klutz, too.
SK0702,747,That's fine! Nothing's more important than cheer when it comes to running the shop.
SK0702,748,I mean, I'm pretty clumsy myself, anyway.
SK0702,749,(I don't think you two are quite on the same level of clumsiness, though...)
SK0702,750,She dresses kind of strangely, but she's pretty cute.
SK0702,751,Really? Heh, I can't wait to meet her.
SK0702,752,Hmm... I don't know how to put it...
SK0702,753,Oh, it's fine, Ogami.
SK0702,754,That means I'll just have more to look forward to once I finally meet her!
SK0702,755,All right, Ogami, I should get back to work.
SK0702,756,Right. Good luck.
SK0702,757,Thank you! All right then, talk to you later!
SK0702,758,All right, what next?
SK0702,759,...
SK0702,760,Tsubaki's not picking up. She must be back at work.
SK0702,761,Good afternoon. This is Capital News.
SK0702,762,Today we begin with a report on infighting within the Imperial Assault Troupe.
SK0702,763,This shocking development was first brought to light in last month's battle in Ikebukuro.
SK0702,764,A unique model of spirit armor had appeared within the troupe's ranks as of May this year...
SK0702,765,But according to eyewitness reports, this armor was seen fighting against the Flower Division's Koubu.
SK0702,766,Continuing our story on the Imperial Assault Troupe's infighting at Ikebukuro.
SK0702,767,The incident occurred amid stormy weather from the landfall of the recent typhoon. Soon thereafter, however...
SK0702,768,...the spirit armor that the Imperial Assault Troupe were seen infighting with was spotted fighting alongside them.
SK0702,769,As a result, there are doubts as to whether or not any infighting had actually occurred.
SK0702,770,We await official confirmation from the Army and the Metropolitan Police Department.
SK0702,771,Up next, are YOU aware of the latest craze sweeping the capital?
SK0702,772,The answer is ballroom dancing. Dancing has been all the rage with the youth lately.
SK0702,773,The establishments where these young people congregate to dance are referred to as "dance halls."
SK0702,774,However, these dance halls have been frowned upon by conservative groups and the elderly...
SK0702,775,They have condemned these places as "promoting frivolous trends among today's youth."
SK0702,776,However, regardless of their negative reputation...
SK0702,777,...it looks like the capital's dance halls will nevertheless be packed once again this evening.
SK0702,778,Finally, it's time for this week's weather forecast.
SK0702,779,The air in the capital has grown quite brisk, as the skies are dotted with cirrocumulus clouds.
SK0702,780,This clear autumn weather is expected to last for the next several days.
SK0702,781,In the Tohoku region, the rice harvest has finally begun.
SK0702,782,Our listeners at home might want to consider spending their days off basking in the autumn leaves.
SK0702,783,That's it for Capital News, brought to you by Capital Daily Report.
SK0702,784,That concludes today's broadcast. We hope you will look forward to tomorrow's programming.
SK0702,785,A red shadow opposes the evildoers lurking in the darkness of the capital. His name is Masked Red!
SK0702,786,Masked Red, the boy wonder of justice! Today he continues his fight for peace in the capital!

SK0702,801,I'm getting worried about Orihime. I should shut this thing off.
SK0702,802,All right, where to next?
SK0702,803,Oops, that time already, huh?
SK0702,804,I should stop with the calls and talk to Orihime already.
SK0702,805,Orihime's most likely in her room.
SK0702,806,Right, I should go and talk to her.
SK0702,807,I wonder if Kaede's in her room right now?
SK0702,808,Guess I'll go somewhere else.
SK0702,809,It's Ogami. Are you there, Kaede?
SK0702,810,Oh, Ogami. The door's unlocked, come in.
SK0702,811,Right. Pardon me.
SK0702,812,Welcome, Ogami. Do you have something for today?
SK0702,813,Have a chat.
SK0702,814,Ask about Ayame.
SK0702,815,Nothing in particular.
SK0702,816,That reminds me, you went to the autumn festival with the others, right?
SK0702,817,Yeah. There were all kinds of stalls there, it was fun.
SK0702,818,We're deep into fall now.
SK0702,819,That reminds me, Sakura and the others said they'd be lighting a bonfire in the courtyard at 2:30.
SK0702,820,Why not go see for yourself, if you haven't already?
SK0702,821,Yeah, I already went. We ate baked sweet potatoes together.
SK0702,822,Ahaha, sounds like fun. I'm glad you're all getting along.
SK0702,823,If it's all right with you, I'd like to ask you about Ayame.
SK0702,824,Why of course. Hmm... What should I talk about?
SK0702,825,No, nothing in particular.
SK0702,826,Oh, really? Hm hm, you really are an odd one, Ogami.
SK0702,827,Well then, I'll excuse myself.
SK0702,828,You're always welcome here.
SK0702,829,All right. Well, I should get going. Please excuse me.
SK0702,830,I'm glad I could talk with her. I should stop by every now and then.
SK0702,831,It's Ogami. Are you there, Kaede?
SK0702,832,Oh, Ogami?
SK0702,833,I'm sorry, but my hands are full with writing these reports right now.
SK0702,834,I see. All right, I'll come back another time.
SK0702,835,Sorry, Ogami. Let's have a nice talk some time later.
SK0702,836,Nobody's here, huh? Well, not like many people usually come here anyway.
SK0702,837,No use staying here. I should go.
SK0702,838,They say fall is for reading. Wouldn't hurt to read a book on occasion.
SK0702,839,Let's see, what books have we got here?
SK0702,840,"The Masked Boxer" Anthology
SK0702,841,"Tactical Theory" Textbook
SK0702,842,Dating Coach" Guidebook
SK0702,843,The Masked Boxer"? Seems like an interesting anthology.
SK0702,844,Written by Keiko Ubehira. A female author, huh?
SK0702,845,Oh, Captain.
SK0702,846,Looking for some fall reading? What book were you looking at?
SK0702,847,Oh, this? It's a book called "The Masked Boxer."
SK0702,848,Reading anthologies now, Captain? You really are an avid reader.
SK0702,849,I love this author's passionate prose.
SK0702,850,I'd recommend taking your time to savor it.
SK0702,851,I see. All right, I'll give it a thorough read when I have the time.
SK0702,852,I think that's a great idea.
SK0702,853,Well then, I have to go.
SK0702,854,I'll be able to play billiards with you until 2:30.
SK0702,855,Figures Maria's already read this book.
SK0702,856,Right, I'll save the reading for later. Time to head somewhere else.
SK0702,857,Tactical Theory", huh? Wouldn't hurt to do some studying on occasion, as captain of the Flower Division.
SK0702,858,Oh, Captain.
SK0702,859,Looking for some fall reading? What book were you looking at?
SK0702,860,Oh, this? It's a textbook called "Tactical Theory."
SK0702,861,Glad to see you're keeping up with your combat studies, Captain.
SK0702,862,But at 6 volumes in total, that book is quite the undertaking.
SK0702,863,Oh, really? I don't think I'll be able to finish it anytime soon, then.
SK0702,864,Well, I'll read it little by little whenever I have the time, then.
SK0702,865,I think that's a great idea.
SK0702,866,Well then, I have to go.
SK0702,867,I'll be able to play billiards with you until 2:30.
SK0702,868,6 volumes in total? The road to mastery sure isn't a short one...
SK0702,869,Right, I should get going, myself.
SK0702,870,This one's called... "Dating Coach"?
SK0702,871,Let's see...
SK0702,872,You, the guy who can't ask women out! You, the guy who worries about where to go on dates!
SK0702,873,This book is for you!
SK0702,874,What kind of book is this? Maybe I'll read just a little bit...
SK0702,875,Oh, Captain.
SK0702,876,Ah! Maria!!
SK0702,877,Looking for some fall reading? What book were you looking at?
SK0702,878,Eeep?!
SK0702,879,..."Dating Coach"?
SK0702,880,The ultimate dating guide. With this, her heart will be yours!"
SK0702,881,...
SK0702,882,I'm sorry for interrupting your precious reading time.
SK0702,883,M-Maria, this isn't, um...
SK0702,884,I have to go now.
SK0702,885,Of all the times for Maria to show up, it had to be when I'm holding this book...
SK0702,886,Oh well, can't help it if I'm unlucky, I guess.
SK0702,887,Hmm... There's so many books, I can't decide.
SK0702,888,Oh, Captain.
SK0702,889,Are you looking for a book? Fall is for reading, after all.
SK0702,890,Yeah, but I'm having a hard time finding a good one.
SK0702,891,Indeed, it's not easy finding a good book.
SK0702,892,Sometimes, a book you've spent ages looking for will bore you.
SK0702,893,Other times, a book you picked up on a whim will totally engross you.
SK0702,894,True. I should take my time finding a book.
SK0702,895,I think that's a great idea.
SK0702,896,Well then, I have to go.
SK0702,897,I'll be able to play billiards with you until 2:30.
SK0702,898,That was some very readerly advice from Maria.
SK0702,899,Right, I should get going, myself.
SK0702,900,Hmm, nobody's here.
SK0702,901,Oh well. Guess I'll check somewhere else.
SK0702,902,I wonder if Reni's inside.
SK0702,903,...She's not here.
SK0702,904,Reni... Still using notebook paper as a nameplate, I see.
SK0702,905,OK, let's check another room.
SK0702,906,I wonder if Sakura is inside.
SK0702,907,...She's not here.
SK0702,908,It's just like Sakura to have a cute nameplate like this.
SK0702,909,OK, let's check another room.
SK0702,910,I wonder if Kanna is inside.
SK0702,911,...She's not here.
SK0702,912,Kanna's... Well, I guess it's more of a nametag than a nameplate.
SK0702,913,OK, let's check another room.
SK0702,914,Orihime... Is she in her room?
SK0702,915,...Who is it?
SK0702,916,It's Ogami.
SK0702,917,Um, what happened back there?
SK0702,918,That's none of your business, Ensign!
SK0702,919,B-But...
SK0702,920,Quit butting in and leave me alone!!
SK0702,921,(Sheesh, couldn't get a word in edgewise...)
SK0702,922,Ah, Mr. Ogami! There you are!
SK0702,923,Tsubomi? What's the matter?
SK0702,924,It's just... There's a strange man standing around out front.
SK0702,925,He's just been standing there, staring at the theater this whole time.
SK0702,926,What should we do, Mr. Ogami?
SK0702,927,OK, got it. I'll take a look.
SK0702,928,That would be great!
SK0702,929,A simple yet classy nameplate.
SK0702,930,Let's go check another room.
SK0702,931,3 o'clock already, huh?
SK0702,932,I'll try knocking. I wonder if Orihime will answer...
SK0702,933,I wonder if Maria is inside.
SK0702,934,It's Maria's nameplate.
SK0702,935,OK, I'll check another room.
SK0702,936,Too bad, doesn't seem like she's here.
SK0702,937,Yes, who is it?
SK0702,938,It's Ogami. Do you have a moment?
SK0702,939,Captain? Come in, the door's open
SK0702,940,OK, then. Excuse me...
SK0702,941,Captain, I was just thinking about the Black Demon Society.
SK0702,942,The Black Demon Society?
SK0702,943,It's already been half a year since they first appeared in Ginza.
SK0702,944,And yet we still don't know what their true motives are.
SK0702,945,What do you think their end goal is, Captain?
SK0702,946,The capital's destruction?
SK0702,947,The Imperial Assault Troupe's defeat?
SK0702,948,This is pure speculation, but maybe the capital's destruction?
SK0702,949,You think so too? I'm of the same opinion.
SK0702,950,It's just... We have no idea when or where they'll come from, nor what they plan on doing.
SK0702,951,This is pure speculation, but maybe the Imperial Assault Troupe's defeat?
SK0702,952,In that case, why didn't Suiko... Saki Kageyama kill us all when she had the chance?
SK0702,953,If they wanted us dead, they could have done so at any moment.
SK0702,954,Hmm... Now that you mention it, that's true too.
SK0702,955,The attempt on Yoneda's life, the freezing of our funding, and the spying...
SK0702,956,They're trying attacking us from the side rather than the front, as it were.
SK0702,957,Perhaps there's a reason they couldn't attack us from behind.
SK0702,958,What on earth could that reason be?
SK0702,959,I don't know. This is just speculation.
SK0702,960,Hmm... To be honest, I don't really know.
SK0702,961,Regardless, making baseless theories could be playing right into their hands.
SK0702,962,That's true. We should at least refrain from these discussions in front of the others.
SK0702,963,At any rate, we have a duty to protect the capital.
SK0702,964,We have to remain vigilant and not let our guard down.
SK0702,965,Yes, sir.
SK0702,966,Sorry for interrupting you while you were deep in thought. I'll be going now.
SK0702,967,No, thank you for having this discussion with me.
SK0702,968,The Black Demons' true motive... It's certainly shrouded in mystery.
SK0702,969,We have no idea where they'll show up next. All we can do is wait.
SK0702,970,Maria said earlier she was thinking about the Black Demon Society.
SK0702,971,I'll leave her alone. Wouldn't want to break her train of thought.
SK0702,972,Iris... Is she inside?
SK0702,973,So Iris's nameplate is shaped like Jean-Paul.
SK0702,974,Guess I'll go somewhere else.
SK0702,975,It's Ogami. Are you there, Iris?
SK0702,976,...
SK0702,977,I'm sorry about earlier. I won't ever look at you in the bath again.
SK0702,978,...Never ever?
SK0702,979,Yeah, I'll never do it again.
SK0702,980,...OK then, I forgive. I don't wanna fight with you anyway.
SK0702,981,OK, come in, Mon Frère!
SK0702,982,Uh-huh! I've been waiting for you, Mon Frère!
SK0702,983,OK, then. Excuse me...
SK0702,984,All right, Iris. Let's get started with your studies.
SK0702,985,Oh, I already did all my studying this morning, Mon Frère.
SK0702,986,Huh?! That's too bad... Or rather, that's great!
SK0702,987,Guess you don't need me here today, then.
SK0702,988,Ah, Mon Frère, wait a second!
SK0702,989,Um... I wrote you a letter.
SK0702,990,A letter? For me?
SK0702,991,Uh-huh. It's kind of embarrassing, but I want you to read it, OK?
SK0702,992,Mon Frère chéri,
SK0702,993,Thank you for all your help with my studies.
SK0702,994,You always woke me up when I was about to fall asleep.
SK0702,995,I'm sorry for getting so sleepy during my study time.
SK0702,996,You helped me learn my multiplication tables with marbles.
SK0702,997,You helped me learn my multiplication tables by memorizing them.
SK0702,998,You stuck a piece of paper with multiplication tables on my wall for me.
SK0702,999,Thanks to you, I was able to solve every math problem Auntie Kaede gave me.
SK0702,1000,3 pages a day, 7 days a week...
SK0702,1001,3 times 7... I was able to finish 21 pages a week.
SK0702,1002,3 pages a day, 7 days a week...
SK0702,1003,3 times 7... I was able to finish 28 pages a week.
SK0702,1004,(Oh geez, she's still getting it wrong.)
SK0702,1005,Whenever you'd praise me at the end of our lessons...
SK0702,1006,...it made me so happy.
SK0702,1007,I still feel like crying sometimes when I get homework...
SK0702,1008,but it feels great when I try my hardest and get it finished.
SK0702,1009,There were times when I fell asleep right after studying,
SK0702,1010,Remember how you tied our legs together to teach me what "cooperation" means?
SK0702,1011,I hope we can keep "cooperating" together, Mon Frère!
SK0702,1012,Remember how you drew that picture of the monkeys to teach me what "cooperation" means?
SK0702,1013,I hope we can keep "cooperating" together, Mon Frère!
SK0702,1014,Remember how you told me that story about the old couple to teach me what "cooperation" means?
SK0702,1015,I hope we can keep "cooperating" together, Mon Frère!
SK0702,1016,I hope we can keep "cooperating" together, Mon Frère!
SK0702,1017,Imperial Assault Troupe, Flower Division... <br> Iris
SK0702,1018,Heheh! That's it.
SK0702,1019,Iris... Thank you.
SK0702,1020,Let's keep cooperating from here on out.
SK0702,1021,OK!
SK0702,1022,I can't believe Iris wrote me a letter like that.
SK0702,1023,I'm... I'm getting a little emotional.
SK0702,1024,I believe Iris said she already finished her studying earlier this morning.
SK0702,1025,It's Ogami. Are you there, Iris?
SK0702,1026,Snoooore... Snoooore...
SK0702,1027,Sounds like she's napping.
SK0702,1028,She must be exhausted after running around the festival like that.
SK0702,1029,I'll leave her alone. Wouldn't want to wake her up.
SK0702,1030,I believe Iris was in the middle of a nap. I'll leave her alone for now.
SK0702,1031,It's Ogami. Are you there, Iris?
SK0702,1032,Guess she's not here. Oh well, I'll go someplace else.
SK0702,1033,I wonder if Kohran is inside.
SK0702,1034,There's no response. Looks like she's in another room.
SK0702,1035,A gear-shaped nameplate, huh? It's just Kohran's style.
SK0702,1036,I'll go check a different room.
SK0702,1037,I wonder if Sumire is inside.
SK0702,1038,Nope, not here.
SK0702,1039,This is a pretty subtle design, considering it's Sumire.
SK0702,1040,I'll go check a different room.
SK0702,1041,3 o'clock already, huh?
SK0702,1042,I can't just keep ignoring Orihime.
SK0702,1043,OK, I'll head to her room and have a talk with her.
SK0702,1044,Oh, Ogami. What do you need?
SK0702,1045,What were you doing just now, sir?
SK0702,1046,Ah, I was just calling Tsubaki.
SK0702,1047,Tsubaki? Calling about what?
SK0702,1048,Oh, you know.
SK0702,1049,...
SK0702,1050,About work?
SK0702,1051,About gossip?
SK0702,1052,About work?
SK0702,1053,About gossip?
SK0702,1054,About the secret project?
SK0702,1055,About gossip?
SK0702,1056,Were you talking to her about work?
SK0702,1057,Well, something like that. Making arrangements for the delivery date.
SK0702,1058,Delivery date?
SK0702,1059,Wahahaha! Don't worry about it. You'll know soon enough.
SK0702,1060,All right, I gotta go. See ya, Ogami.
SK0702,1061,Hmm... What on earth were they talking about?
SK0702,1062,What's this about a "delivery date", anyway? Man, this is gonna bug me.
SK0702,1063,Let me guess, you were talking to her about gossip?
SK0702,1064,Something like that, yeah.
SK0702,1065,Yuri won't stop pestering me for updates on Tsubaki.
SK0702,1066,All right, I gotta go. See ya, Ogami.
SK0702,1067,Hmm... What was he talking with her about, anyway?
SK0702,1068,Let me guess, something to do with that "secret project"?
SK0702,1069,...Maybe, maybe not.
SK0702,1070,All right, I gotta go. See ya, Ogami.
SK0702,1071,Hmm... What on earth were they talking about?
SK0702,1072,He didn't exactly deny it, so maybe it WAS actually about the secret project.
SK0702,1073,All right, I gotta go. See ya, Ogami.
SK0702,1074,Hmm... What was he talking with her about, anyway?
SK0702,1075,Doesn't look like the manager's here.
SK0702,1076,Still, I wonder just what it is they were talking about...
SK0702,1077,The steam processor... An incredible machine, one of only a few in all of Japan.
SK0702,1078,Yet even it wouldn't know what Orihime's thinking.
SK0702,1079,Hmm... Guess no one's here.
SK0702,1080,I probably shouldn't stick around here.
SK0702,1081,Ooh, smells like soap in here. Must be because Iris just took a bath.
SK0702,1082,There's no use of standing idly in here. Let's move to another room.
SK0702,1083,I thought someone might be taking a bath right now, but I guess not.
SK0702,1084,Oh well, I'll just go somewhere else.
SK0702,1085,Huh? Looks like someone's in the bathroom.
SK0702,1086,There's a large ribbon here... And isn't that Jean-Paul?
SK0702,1087,Then that means Iris is the one taking a bath...
SK0702,1088,My body is moving towards the bathroom on its own...
SK0702,1089,Go back outside.
SK0702,1090,Oh no, my body is moving towards the bathroom on its own...
SK0702,1091,(Ah... Iris...)
SK0702,1092,Dum de dum...
SK0702,1093,Ah, that festival was so much fun!
SK0702,1094,I got to see so many stalls with Mon Frère.
SK0702,1095,I wish there were festivals every day!
SK0702,1096,Say something.
SK0702,1097,Quietly leave.
SK0702,1098,Hey Iris, how's the water?
SK0702,1099,Huh?!
SK0702,1100,M-Mon Frère?! What are you doing here?!
SK0702,1101,It's just, you looked like you were enjoying yourself, so...
SK0702,1102,E...
SK0702,1103,EWWWWWWWW! You're such a pervert, Mon Frère!!
SK0702,1104,Ow ow ow ow ow... Looks like Iris blasted me out of there with her powers.
SK0702,1105,Can't say I didn't deserve it, though. What a mess.
SK0702,1106,(She looks like she's enjoying her bath. I shouldn't bother her.)
SK0702,1107,(Let's get out of here before she sees me.)
SK0702,1108,Phew, looks like she didn't notce.
SK0702,1109,She'd never let me live it down if she saw me.
SK0702,1110,...
SK0702,1111,...Huh?
SK0702,1112,M-Mon Frère?! What are you doing here?!
SK0702,1113,I, um, sorta just... stumbled in here without realizing it...
SK0702,1114,E...
SK0702,1115,EWWWWWWWW! You're such a pervert, Mon Frère!!
SK0702,1116,Ow ow ow ow ow... Looks like Iris blasted me out of there with her powers.
SK0702,1117,Can't say I didn't deserve it, though. What a mess.
SK0702,1118,She must be washing off all the sweat from our festival visit.
SK0702,1119,I shouldn't interrupt her in the middle of her bath, so I'll just go.
SK0702,1120,Right, where to next?
SK0702,1121,Ah, that felt great! I should get out now.
SK0702,1122,(C-Crap! Gotta get out of here before she sees me!)
SK0702,1123,Phew, I think I got away before she realized I was there.
SK0702,1124,If I'd been just a moment slower, I might not have made it. That was too close...
SK0702,1125,...
SK0702,1126,Sorry about earlier, Iris.
SK0702,1127,I just kind of stumbled in, and...
SK0702,1128,Mon Frère, you do realize I'm a proper lady now, right?
SK0702,1129,I really am sorry. I won't do it again.
SK0702,1130,I don't wanna fight with you Mon Frère, so I'll forgive you...
SK0702,1131,But don't peep on me ever again.
SK0702,1132,I can't believe Iris was the one lecturing me this time...
SK0702,1133,Well, Iris seems to be in a better mood now, so I should get going.
SK0702,1134,Oh, Mon Frère! Are you here to take a bath?
SK0702,1135,N-Nope, just passing through.
SK0702,1136,I actually just finished taking a bath!
SK0702,1137,It was so refreshing! It felt great!
SK0702,1138,All right, I'm gonna go now. Bye-bye, Mon Frère!
SK0702,1139,Oh yeah! Come study with me again sometime, OK, Mon Frère?
SK0702,1140,That big smile of hers... Staying determined really was the right answer all along.
SK0702,1141,OK, I should get going myself.
SK0702,1142,Looks like no one's taking a bath right now.
SK0702,1143,I'll go to a different room. I wonder where everyone else is?
SK0702,1144,Hey, Reni. Taking a swim?
SK0702,1145,...Diving training.
SK0702,1146,I'm recovering robots from the bottom of the pool while avoiding dummy mines.
SK0702,1147,Kohran made them for me.
SK0702,1148,I see. Sounds pretty fun.
SK0702,1149,...Would you like to try, Captain?
SK0702,1150,All right, I'll give it a shot!
SK0702,1151,I-I'll pass.
SK0702,1152,I-I'll pass. Seems pretty dangerous...
SK0702,1153,Well, I have places I need to be, so I'll just go now.
SK0702,1154,...I see.
SK0702,1155,See you later, Reni. Good luck with your training.
SK0702,1156,Hmm, what to do...
SK0702,1157,It's quite dangerous, so you shouldn't force yourself if you don't want to.
SK0702,1158,You're right. There are other things I need to do anyway.
SK0702,1159,See you later, Reni. Good luck with your training.
SK0702,1160,All right, I'll give it a shot! Time to show you what I learned in the Navy!
SK0702,1161,...Show me what you've got, Captain.
SK0702,1162,R-Reni... I guess some things never change, huh?
SK0702,1163,All right, back in my normal clothes. Training safely completed.
SK0702,1164,How was that, Reni? Not bad, huh?
SK0702,1165,Indeed, you were quite skilled. Highly efficient, no wasted movements.
SK0702,1166,I should try this again sometime. You can make it harder then.
SK0702,1167,...Yeah, sure.
SK0702,1168,All right, Captain, I should get going.
SK0702,1169,OK, good work today. See ya, Reni.
SK0702,1170,I never would've dreamed I could train with Reni like that before now.
SK0702,1171,I haven't swam like that in ages, made for some great exercise. I'm glad I tried that.
SK0702,1172,All right, back in my normal clothes. Training safely completed.
SK0702,1173,How was that, Reni? It wasn't perfect, but not bad, right?
SK0702,1174,You made a few unnecessary movements, but if you work on those, you'll become much more efficient.
SK0702,1175,Hahaha, as harsh as I expected, Reni.
SK0702,1176,I should try this again sometime. I'll do even better then.
SK0702,1177,...Yeah, sure.
SK0702,1178,All right, Captain, I should get going.
SK0702,1179,OK, good work today. See ya, Reni.
SK0702,1180,I never would've dreamed I could train with Reni like that before now.
SK0702,1181,I haven't swam like that in ages, made for some great exercise. I'm glad I tried that.
SK0702,1182,Phew... I feel a bit better now that I finished changing.
SK0702,1183,But man, that was pretty sloppy, huh?
SK0702,1184,You made so many wasted movements down there; I'd hardly call that training.
SK0702,1185,As harsh as I expected, Reni...
SK0702,1186,I should try this again sometime. I'll do even better then.
SK0702,1187,...Yeah, sure.
SK0702,1188,All right, Captain, I should get going.
SK0702,1189,OK, good work today. See ya, Reni.
SK0702,1190,I made a fool of myself back there... But still, I'm glad I got to train with Reni.
SK0702,1191,I never would've dreamed I could train with Reni like that before now.
SK0702,1192,Hey, Reni. Finished with your diving training?
SK0702,1193,Yes. Too much exercise can have the opposite effect than intended.
SK0702,1194,OK, I have to go now, sir.
SK0702,1195,Yeah, good work today.
SK0702,1196,Guess I should get going, too.
SK0702,1197,Nobody's swimming in here right now.
SK0702,1198,No use sticking around. I'd better go.
SK0702,1199,They say fall is also for sports. I could go for some exercise.
SK0702,1200,I have things I need to do, though, so maybe next time.
SK0702,1201,The door back there leads to the Rose Division's quarters.
SK0702,1202,Seriously, though, when the hell did they construct that room?
SK0702,1203,Oh, Ensign Ogami, welcome!
SK0702,1204,Ichirooo! Welcome!
SK0702,1205,Well? Do you feel like giving me a kiss yet?
SK0702,1206,Y-Yokihiko!
SK0702,1207,Oooh, you're scaring me! Don't glare at me like that, Kiku!
SK0702,1208,By the way, Ensign Ogami, I'm told Reni's undertaking some diving training starting at 2:30.
SK0702,1209,Perhaps you should head over to the pool if you have free time?
SK0702,1210,S-Sure.
SK0702,1211,Don't ever hesitate to drop on by here, Ichiro!
SK0702,1212,I... I also... would approve of that.
SK0702,1213,OK, Kiku, let's grab him!
SK0702,1214,Eep! I-I have to go now, bye!!
SK0702,1215,*pant* *pant* I managed to make it out somehow...
SK0702,1216,I swear, I'm putting my life on the line every time I step into that room.
SK0702,1217,Ah... O-Ogami!
SK0702,1218,You came back! I'm so happy!!
SK0702,1219,OK, everyone! This time we'll grab him for sure!
SK0702,1220,Wahhhh!! I-I REALLY have to go now, bye!!
SK0702,1221,*pant* *gasp* Finally made it out of there...
SK0702,1222,Seriously, why do I keep going into that room?
SK0702,1223,That battle last month was quite the ordeal.
SK0702,1224,I never imagined I'd have to fight against Reni in her Eisenkleid.
SK0702,1225,3 o'clock already, huh?
SK0702,1226,I can't just keep ignoring Orihime.
SK0702,1227,OK, I'll head to her room and have a talk with her.
SK0702,1228,Sorry, Ogami, but each customer is only allowed to purchase one photo at a time.
SK0702,1229,I see. That's too bad.
SK0702,1230,So sorry, Ogami. I can only sell you one piece at a time to the same person.
SK0702,1231,Oh, really? That's too bad.

SK0702,1304,A scarf given to me by Sakura. It's knitted with yellow yarn - my favorite color.
SK0702,1305,Ayame and I almost never lived in the same household, even though we were sisters.
SK0702,1306,Eh...?
SK0702,1307,It’s not so unusual, given our lineage. We have less a "family tree" and more a "family wisteria."
SK0702,1308,Yet, I still knew that she was the type of person that would sacrifice her own well-being for others...
SK0702,1309,Carrying everyone’s burdens by herself...
SK0702,1310,That’s why, when I received the news that she had passed away, I made up my mind.
SK0702,1311,I want to carry on her will. I want to protect the capital, just like she did.
SK0702,1312,And for my own sake, too.
SK0702,1313,...I suppose that’s all I have to say.
SK0702,1314,You know, Ogami, I came here to work of my own volition.
SK0702,1315,To protect the peace of this city, and to cherish our audience's smiles.
SK0702,1316,I'm sure you feel the same, Ogami.
SK0702,1317,Yes, of course.
SK0702,1318,So let’s both do our best.
SK0702,1319,For my sister... <br> For everyone...
SK0702,1320,Yes ma'am!
SK0702,1321,Well, today I will tell you about the Anti-Kouma Corps.
SK0702,1322,The Anti-Kouma Corps was the army's predecessor to the Imperial Assault Troupe.
SK0702,1323,Ikki Yoneda, Kazuma Shinguji, Shinnosuke Yamazaki, and... Ayame Fujieda.
SK0702,1324,A special unit, comprising only those four, formed to defend the capital from evil.
SK0702,1325,Seven years ago... A Kouma appeared in Nihonbashi.
SK0702,1326,Even though it was just a single Kouma, military and police were powerless against it.
SK0702,1327,However, the Anti-Kouma Corps managed to seal the Kouma away, albeit at great cost.
SK0702,1328,That incident made the government painfully aware of the need to defend against such evil.
SK0702,1329,As a result, the Imperial Assault Troupe as you know it was born.
SK0702,1330,The troupe is the fruit of the Anti-Kouma Corps' will.
SK0702,1331,And, of the four members, only General Yoneda is still alive today.
SK0702,1332,For the sake of those four, who protected the people from evil... We have to keep fighting.
SK0702,1333,...
SK0702,1334,Now then, today I’ll tell you about Ayame’s travels.
SK0702,1335,In order to recruit members for the Flower Division, Ayame traveled around the world.
SK0702,1336,She searched for suitable candidates for the Flower Division, girls with powerful spiritual abilities.
SK0702,1337,She sent me letters from various countries. America, France, China...
SK0702,1338,Whenever she did, I must be honest, I envied her.
SK0702,1339,I see, so she did all that...
SK0702,1340,Those same candidates make up the Flower Division we have now.
SK0702,1341,And you know what, Ogami? Recently, I've been thinking...
SK0702,1342,The people Ayame chose truly were the best people for the job. That includes you.
SK0702,1343,Kaede...
SK0702,1344,Ayame entrusted the Flower Division to me, so I'll continue to give it my all.
SK0702,1345,Don't give up. Even in the hardest of times, remember to never give up, Ogami.
SK0702,1346,Yes ma’am! I will do all I can to meet your expectations!
SK0702,1347,Now then, today I’ll tell you about Ayame and Major Yamazaki.
SK0702,1348,Both Ayame and Major Yamazaki were members of the Imperial Assault Troupe's predecessor, the Anti-Kouma Corps.
SK0702,1349,Major Yamazaki was a brilliant scientist who came up with the foundational designs for Spirit Armor...
SK0702,1350,And they say he had a stronger sense of justice than most.
SK0702,1351,Anyone could see that Ayame and Major Yamazaki were deeply in love with each other...
SK0702,1352,But their relationship crumbled when the Kouma War started.
SK0702,1353,What could have possibly caused that?
SK0702,1354,Now, this is pure conjecture...
SK0702,1355,But it seems that during their battles with the Kouma, Major Yamazaki became obsessed with certain questions.
SK0702,1356,What are these demons?" "Why do they exist?"
SK0702,1357,And "how are they so powerful?"
SK0702,1358,General Yoneda noticed that Major Yamazaki had changed, and he warned him many times.
SK0702,1359,But, in the end, no one could change his mind.
SK0702,1360,Not even Ayame...
SK0702,1361,When the Kouma War ended seven years ago, Major Yamazaki went missing.
SK0702,1362,And then in our recent battles, he appeared again as Cerulean Satan.
SK0702,1363,Justice by power... <br> Rule through evil...
SK0702,1364,Perhaps that was his conclusion...
SK0702,1365,Back when he appeared in front of the theater six months ago...
SK0702,1366,I wonder what Cerulean Satan... No, what Major Yamazaki was trying to tell us...
SK0702,1367,...
SK0702,1368,... "" "" () - . , ! ? ?! !!

SK0702,1434,You need to spread out your activities. Hang out with a lot of good people. Cherish the small encounters.
SK0702,1435,Ride your bike along the river. You may come across some interesting incidents.
SK0702,1436,This week, you will meet your ideal person. Your favorite restaurant will be the place to meet someone.
SK0702,1437,There may be a lot of opposition from people around you. Don't be too hard on yourself. Try to listen to their opinions.
SK0702,1438,A balanced relationship and a serious approach to socializing will help you.
SK0702,1439,If you try to do things out in the open, you might get sidetracked and end up striking out...
SK0702,1440,Your money luck is going down this week. When in doubt, don't buy anything.
SK0702,1441,There's a chance to make progress in your relationship. A date at an intellectual place such as a museum or art gallery is also recommended.
SK0702,1442,Energy floods your whole body. You can be active in any situation. In love, you will be compatible.
SK0702,1443,All your hard work has paid off. My work and relationships are going well. You are in good physical and mental health.
SK0702,1444,Your luck is at its peak. There may be times when you go too far. It's important to be considerate of those around you.
SK0702,1445,Be careful with your fingertips. The slightest injury could become a serious problem.
SK0702,1446,Whaaaaa?!
SK0703,1,...
SK0703,2,(Huh? Isn't that the portrait artist from earlier?)
SK0703,3,(Is this who Tsubomi was talking about?)
SK0703,4,*sigh*...
SK0703,5,Um... Excuse me, sir.
SK0703,6,Huh? Oh, it's you, the one from before.
SK0703,7,My name is Ichiro Ogami, I work here at this theater.
SK0703,8,I apologize for all the commotion earlier.
SK0703,9,No, that's all right. I wasn't getting any customers anyway. I had time to kill.
SK0703,10,Um, I'm sorry, but what was your name, sir?
SK0703,11,Right, you may call me Ogata. I am but a humble wandering artist.
SK0703,12,Mr. Ogata, do you have business with us here at the theater?
SK0703,13,This wouldn't have anything to do with Orihime, would it?
SK0703,14,...
SK0703,15,Ah, pardon me, I spoke out of turn.
SK0703,16,No, it's all right.
SK0703,17,...
SK0703,18,Ogami, was it? Are you and Orihime...?
SK0703,19,Yes, we work together at this theater.
SK0703,20,I see. Then maybe it'd be better if I spoke with you instead.
SK0703,21,The truth is... Orihime... She's...
SK0703,22,My daughter...
SK0703,23,Huh?! Wh-What did you say?!
SK0703,24,All right, Mr. Ogata, please, have a seat.
SK0703,25,But I...
SK0703,26,I'm sorry if I'm being intrusive, but... could you tell me more about Orihime?
SK0703,27,As her coworker at this theater, I want to be there for her.
SK0703,28,I want her to be back to her usual, cheerful self.
SK0703,29,Ogami...
SK0703,30,Nobody's here...
SK0703,31,When I heard someone was standing outside the theater, I thought it might be...
SK0703,32,Oh well, I'll go back to my room.
SK0703,33,...
SK0703,34,I understand. If that's what you want, then I'll tell you.
SK0703,35,...?! That voice... It can't be!
SK0703,36,I may be a lowly caricaturist now, but back in the day, I dreamed of becoming an artist.
SK0703,37,I traveled to Italy, wandering from place to place, spending every passing day by drawing.
SK0703,38,That's when... I met her.
SK0703,39,Her name was Carino Soletta... Orihime's mother.
SK0703,40,I see, so that's how that happened...
SK0703,41,Ask about Carino.
SK0703,42,Ask about Orihime.
SK0703,43,Could you tell me more about Carino?
SK0703,44,Carino was as warm and radiant as the Mediterranean sun.
SK0703,45,Not only that, but she was beautiful, too.
SK0703,46,Before we knew it, we had fallen in love... and had Orihime.
SK0703,47,I visited Carino's family, seeking their permission to be wed.
SK0703,48,However, Carino belonged to a wealthy Italian family...
SK0703,49,The Soletta family, also known as "The Red Nobles."
SK0703,50,There was no way they'd ever allow me, a mere artist, to be with Carino.
SK0703,51,However, Orihime had already been born by then.
SK0703,52,They separated us, and forbid me from ever seeing my daughter.
SK0703,53,I had to think of Carino and Orihime's happiness, and so, I had no choice but to leave them.
SK0703,54,With my dream of living as an artist also in shambles, I returned to Japan.
SK0703,55,Mr. Ogata...
SK0703,56,Could you tell me more about Orihime?
SK0703,57,About half a year ago, I picked up a flier for the Imperial Theater, and I couldn't believe my eyes.
SK0703,58,There on the flier was my daughter's name.
SK0703,59,My daughter was in Japan... Not only that, but she was close by, too.
SK0703,60,I thought about coming to see her so many times, but... I couldn't.
SK0703,61,I abandoned her and her mother for over a decade. I have no right to call myself her father.
SK0703,62,Mr. Ogata...
SK0703,63,I had no idea Orihime had that kind of upbringing.
SK0703,64,Is that why she hates Japanese men as much as she does?
SK0703,65,If nothing else, Ogami, believe me when I say this...
SK0703,66,Even if I was never able to see her, I've always prayed for Orihime's happiness.
SK0703,67,That's a lie!!
SK0703,68,That voice!
SK0703,69,Everything you just said is total nonsense! You're nothing but a liar!
SK0703,70,O-Orihime!
SK0703,71,You think I don't know the truth?
SK0703,72,You're... You're the scumbag who abandoned Mama and I!
SK0703,73,Just go! Get out of my sight! And don't you ever come back!
SK0703,74,Orihime!
SK0703,75,I... I can never forgive him for what he did to us!
SK0703,76,Orihime...
SK0703,77,Don't bother. I did walk out on her mother, that's a fact.
SK0703,78,...
SK0703,79,It's true, I have no right to call myself her father.
SK0703,80,There's no reason she would ever forgive me.
SK0703,81,Mr. Ogata...
SK0703,82,I'm sorry for causing such a disturbance. I'll be going now.
SK0703,83,Ogami... Please... Take care of Orihime.
SK0703,84,...
SK0703,85,Sorry, Ogami, but each customer is only allowed to purchase one photo at a time.
SK0703,86,I see. That's too bad.
SK0703,87,So sorry, Mr. Ogami. I can only sell one per person.
SK0703,88,Oh, really? That's too bad.

SK0703,163,Whaaaaa?!
SK0704,1,Your Excellency, the time has finally come to enact our plan.
SK0704,2,A state ruled by the Imperial Army...
SK0704,3,We of the Taisho Restoration Army will gladly sacrifice ourselves for your ideals, Your Excellency!
SK0704,4,Well said, Amagasa.
SK0704,5,The future of the capital rests on our shoulders.
SK0704,6,We make our move November 9th! You will be in charge of seizing the Grand Imperial Theater.
SK0704,7,Yoneda's a traitor who belittles the very existence of our legitimate army. You will deal with him.
SK0704,8,And... You will capture Sakura Shinguji of the Flower Division.
SK0704,9,If she attempts to resist... Kill her. I don't care either way.
SK0704,10,Yessir! Leave it to me, sir!
SK0704,11,Heheheh... The hour approaches.
SK0704,12,The Taisho Restoration, the dawn of a new Japan, is finally at hand.
SK0704,13,OK, time to get started on my night watch.
SK0704,14,I'm still worried about Orihime, though...
SK0704,15,Yo, Ogami!
SK0704,16,That voice...
SK0704,17,Oh, Kayama. What do you want?
SK0704,18,That's cold, Ogami. After I came all this way, too. I'm crushed!
SK0704,19,...Just come inside.
SK0704,20,Hmph, very well. Alley OOP!
SK0704,21,Say, Ogami, you're looking as troubled as ever.
SK0704,22,Yeah... A lot's happened.
SK0704,23,Come now, Ogami, have you forgotten that old saying? "After rain comes fair weather."
SK0704,24,The more two people quarrel, the stronger their relationship will become in the end.
SK0704,25,Ahh, humans are truly complicated creatures.
SK0704,26,That's true, no matter how much they fight, Orihime and Ogata are still family.
SK0704,27,Thanks, Kayama. I appreciate the advice.
SK0704,28,Attaboy, Ogami. Well then, farewell! Alley OOP!
SK0704,29,All right, I'll stop by Orihime's room while I'm doing my rounds.
SK0704,30,It's 9:30 right now... That gives me a half hour till 10.
SK0704,31,The door's shut tight. It's properly locked.
SK0704,32,OK, onto the next room.
SK0704,33,Nothing unusual out in the lobby.
SK0704,34,OK, continuing the night watch, then.
SK0704,35,The merchandise is neatly organized. Tsubomi's pretty tidy.
SK0704,36,OK, nothing out of the ordinary here. Continuing my night watch.
SK0704,37,Yo, Boss. Out on your rounds?
SK0704,38,What are you up to, Kanna?
SK0704,39,Heheh, I got a little hungry, so I'm having a quick meal.
SK0704,40,Oh yeah, I didn't see Orihime come down here at all this evening.
SK0704,41,I don't know what's up with her, but she shouldn't be skipping out on meals.
SK0704,42,That's true.
SK0704,43,It's OK to not have an appetite.
SK0704,44,That's true. Skipping meals is bad for your health.
SK0704,45,Glad you agree, Boss.
SK0704,46,All right, if she still hasn't come out by tomorrow, I'll bring her something instead.
SK0704,47,No, there's times where you just don't feel like eating. Like when you're worried about something, for example.
SK0704,48,Y-Ya think so? I eat like a pig when I get nervous.
SK0704,49,Well, everyone's different.
SK0704,50,All right, if she still hasn't come out by tomorrow, I'll bring her something instead.
SK0704,51,What's up, Boss? You're spacing out.
SK0704,52,Oh, s-sorry, I was just thinking...
SK0704,53,C'mon, you all right? Keep it together!
SK0704,54,You should head to bed yourself, Kanna.
SK0704,55,*yawn* Yeah, you're right. Eating so much has got me all sleepy anyway.
SK0704,56,All right, I'm headin' to my room. Night, Boss.
SK0704,57,Right, I should get back to my night watch.
SK0704,58,Seems like Kanna's back in her room.
SK0704,59,Nothing particularly unusual here. I'll check another room.
SK0704,60,Gotta check for fire hazards... Can't be too careful about fires.
SK0704,61,All right, we're clear. Let's check another room.
SK0704,62,Let's check this door...
SK0704,63,All right, it's properly locked. No issues here.
SK0704,64,Kasumi and Yuri have long since gone already.
SK0704,65,Nothing out of the ordinary here. I'll go somewhere else.
SK0704,66,Zzzzzzz... Zzzzzzz...
SK0704,67,Sounds like the manager's asleep. Hope he doesn't catch a cold, falling asleep in his chair like that...
SK0704,68,Well, I suppose I don't need to check in there.
SK0704,69,Nobody's here. Nothing out of the ordinary, either.
SK0704,70,I should get back to patrolling.
SK0704,71,Nothing strange here. Same as it ever was.
SK0704,72,I'll go patrol elsewhere.
SK0704,73,Backstage at night... You can still faintly make out the smell of makeup in the air.
SK0704,74,Nobody's here and nothing's unusual. I should go.
SK0704,75,(Huh? It's Sumire.)
SK0704,76,(Where's she headed to at this hour?)
SK0704,77,(It looked like she went towards the stage...)
SK0704,78,Hm? I think I can hear something from over by the stage.
SK0704,79,Sumire?
SK0704,80,Ah?!
SK0704,81,E-Ensign!
SK0704,82,Were you practicing your dancing, Sumire?
SK0704,83,O-Of course not! A natural talent like me doesn't need practice!
SK0704,84,I was just chasing around a bug, that's all.
SK0704,85,A bug? Where?
SK0704,86,...Right.
SK0704,87,A bug? Where? Where did it go?
SK0704,88,Well, that's...
SK0704,89,Oh for heaven's sake, Ensign! Try to read the room!
SK0704,90,Yes, it's true. I was practicing my dancing.
SK0704,91,Huh. I thought as much.
SK0704,92,And now you're going to help me with said dance practice.
SK0704,93,I want you to move the spotlight and have it follow me as I dance.
SK0704,94,W-Wait, I'm still on my night watch...
SK0704,95,No excuses! Now get to it!
SK0704,96,Right. Bugs do tend to appear more often in the fall.
SK0704,97,Sorry to bother you, then. I'll be going now.
SK0704,98,Ah, Ensign... Wait a moment.
SK0704,99,You see, I... I actually WAS practicing my dancing.
SK0704,100,I didn't want anyone to see me, so that's why I said what I did earlier.
SK0704,101,I don't want to lie to you, Ensign...
SK0704,102,Sumire...
SK0704,103,Thank you for being so considerate of me, Ensign.
SK0704,104,If it's all right with you, would you perhaps mind assisting me with my dance practice?
SK0704,105,All you have to do is move the spotlight and have it follow me as I dance.
SK0704,106,Hmm... I hope I can manage.
SK0704,107,I know you'll do just fine. Now then, let us dance.
SK0704,108,...
SK0704,109,U-Um...
SK0704,110,I'm sorry, Ensign. The truth is, I WAS practicing my dancing.
SK0704,111,I didn't want anyone to see me, so that's why I said what I did earlier.
SK0704,112,As it turns out, it doesn't sit well with me to lie...
SK0704,113,Sumire...
SK0704,114,You've already found out, so there's no use in hiding it anymore.
SK0704,115,And now you're going to help me with said dance practice.
SK0704,116,I want you to move the spotlight and have it follow me as I dance.
SK0704,117,Huh? I don't know how good I'll be at it...
SK0704,118,I know you'll do just fine. Now then, let us dance.
SK0704,119,Phew... How was that, Sumire?
SK0704,120,Splendid, Ensign. Bathed in that glimmering light, I could dance with ease.
SK0704,121,How would you feel about becoming my personal lighting technician, Ensign?
SK0704,122,Uhh... Well... I...
SK0704,123,Ohohohoho! Relax, Ensign, I'm only kidding.
SK0704,124,Now then, I must be going. Take care, Ensign.
SK0704,125,Lighting technician, huh? I wonder if that'd suit me better than being a ticket puncher?
SK0704,126,...Now's not the time to be thinking about that. I have to get back to my rounds.
SK0704,127,Phew... How was that, Sumire?
SK0704,128,I think you have a knack for this.
SK0704,129,Perhaps it wouldn't be such a bad idea to become a lighting technician as well as a ticket puncher?
SK0704,130,A lighting technician, huh? Hmmm...
SK0704,131,Now then, I must be going. Take care, Ensign.
SK0704,132,Lighting technician, huh? I wonder if that'd suit me better than being a ticket puncher?
SK0704,133,...Now's not the time to be thinking about that. I have to get back to my rounds.
SK0704,134,Sorry, Sumire... I wasn't very good at controlling the spotlight.
SK0704,135,Well, it was your first time. Don't worry about it too much.
SK0704,136,Now then, I must be going. Take care, Ensign.
SK0704,137,Hmmm, I wish I'd done a little better...
SK0704,138,Oh well. I should be getting back to my night watch.
SK0704,139,Sumire had me help her with her dance practice here just a moment ago.
SK0704,140,So typical of her, not letting anyone see her exerting any effort.
SK0704,141,Nobody here except maybe some rats.
SK0704,142,Nothing unusual here. Moving on.
SK0704,143,Sumire had me help her with her dance practice here just a moment ago.
SK0704,144,So typical of her, not letting anyone see her exerting any effort.
SK0704,145,This place is always deserted, both day and night.
SK0704,146,Nothing out of the ordinary here. Back to my night watch.
SK0704,147,Oh, Mon Frère! Reni was just teaching me about the stars!
SK0704,148,Reni knows all sorts of stuff about stars!
SK0704,149,...The position of the stars can help you keep your bearings in battle.
SK0704,150,Guess what, Mon Frère? She taught me about the "bigdipper."
SK0704,151,Oh, you mean the Big Dipper?
SK0704,152,If you follow the handle of the bigdipper alllll the way down...
SK0704,153,...there's a star you can find at the very end. Do you know what it's called?
SK0704,154,The North Star?
SK0704,155,The South Star?
SK0704,156,The North Star?
SK0704,157,The South Star?
SK0704,158,The Star of Happiness?
SK0704,159,The North Star, right? I learned that in the Navy.
SK0704,160,Wow, Mon Frère, you're so smart!
SK0704,161,Not bad, Captain.
SK0704,162,I'm pretty sure it was the South Star, right?
SK0704,163,...Wrong. There is no such thing as the "South Star." The correct answer is the "North Star."
SK0704,164,Mon Frère, if you don't know something, don't pretend that you do!
SK0704,165,Hmmm, maybe it's the Star of Happiness? Hahahaha!
SK0704,166,Hahahaha! You're so funny, Mon Frère!
SK0704,167,Wasn't that funny, Reni?
SK0704,168,Y... Yes.
SK0704,169,Bzzzt! Time's up!
SK0704,170,It's called the "North Star." That one, over there!
SK0704,171,Alpha Ursae Minoris, more commonly known as The North Star.
SK0704,172,The Big Dipper is a chain of stars that partially constitute Ursa Major.
SK0704,173,Huh... They're a family of bears!
SK0704,174,Even though the night sky is so big, they're so close to each other. They must get along great.
SK0704,175,...Yeah, you're right.
SK0704,176,All right, I have to get back to my night watch. See you later, you two.
SK0704,177,OK! Good luck with your night watch!
SK0704,178,A family, huh?
SK0704,179,Even in the vast night sky, you can find families who are close to each other, just as Iris said...
SK0704,180,But some families don't get along, no matter how close to each other they are.
SK0704,181,Could Mr. Ogata and Orihime ever patch things up?
SK0704,182,Oh, Mon Frère! Reni and I were just making our own Jean-Paul constellation!
SK0704,183,Hahaha... Don't go to bed too late, OK?
SK0704,184,Okaaay!
SK0704,185,Right, now back to my night watch.
SK0704,186,Past ten already, huh? I should call it here.
SK0704,187,OK, guess I'll go talk to Orihime now.
SK0704,188,Oh, Ogami.
SK0704,189,On your night watch, Chief? Thanks for your hard work.
SK0704,190,Kohran, Sakura? What's up?
SK0704,191,It's Orihime. She didn't come out of her room for dinner.
SK0704,192,We tried going to her room, but she wouldn't let us in.
SK0704,193,I was on my way to maintain the Koubu, so I thought I'd give her a holler, too...
SK0704,194,...But no matter what we tried, she wouldn't budge. Got any ideas?
SK0704,195,I'll try talking to her.
SK0704,196,I'll try making her angry.
SK0704,197,I'll try talking to her, so you don't have to worry about anything. You can rest easy.
SK0704,198,Really? Thank you.
SK0704,199,You're so dependable, Ogami.
SK0704,200,Seems like it's gonna be a lot of trouble, though. Even for you, Chief.
SK0704,201,I'll try making her angry. That might put her in a more talkative mood.
SK0704,202,Huh?! But that's...
SK0704,203,Hold on, Sakura, that could actually work.
SK0704,204,This is Orihime we're talking about. If we make her mad, we could maybe get her to talk.
SK0704,205,I think that's a great plan, Chief. Good luck.
SK0704,206,Come on, Ogami, say something!
SK0704,207,Seriously, Chief. You need to have your head in the game, especially at a time like this.
SK0704,208,Well, see you two later. I gotta go work on the Koubu.
SK0704,209,Good luck with Orihime, Chief!
SK0704,210,I'll be going to my room, then.
SK0704,211,Good night, Ogami. Good luck with your night watch.
SK0704,212,Hmmm... Will Orihime really talk to me?
SK0704,213,At any rate, I guess I'll continue my night watch for now.
SK0704,214,Brr, it's cold... Winter's almost here.
SK0704,215,Gotta make sure the door's properly closed... OK, let's check another room.
SK0704,216,The chandelier's shining so brilliantly.
SK0704,217,It doesn't look like this light will go out till morning. That's the Imperial Theater for you.
SK0704,218,Day or night, this place never changes much.
SK0704,219,Everything seems normal here. OK, where to next?
SK0704,220,Nobody's here. The fireplace has been put out, too.
SK0704,221,All right, nothing unusual here. Let's check another room.
SK0704,222,Figures nobody'd be playing in here at this hour.
SK0704,223,I should get going. There's nothing unusual here anyway.
SK0704,224,I've still got some time left.
SK0704,225,I still haven't talked to Orihime, either... I should get back to my night watch.
SK0704,226,Kaede? Are you in there?
SK0704,227,I better check another room, I guess.
SK0704,228,Yes, who is it?
SK0704,229,Um, it's Ogami.
SK0704,230,Oh, Ogami? Good job with the night watch.
SK0704,231,There's nothing unusual to report in my room.
SK0704,232,If you want to talk, could you come back tomorrow? I'm writing my report right now. 
SK0704,233,I see. Understood.
SK0704,234,Well then, good night, Kaede.
SK0704,235,Good night, Ogami.
SK0704,236,Kaede said she was writing her report, right? I shouldn't bother her.
SK0704,237,Brr, it's cold. The nights have started to get chillier, as expected.
SK0704,238,I don't see anything unusual here, so let's go somewhere else right away. Brr, cold...
SK0704,239,I'd love to take some time to flip through a book, but I'm on patrol right now...
SK0704,240,Perhaps I'll come back to read some other time.
SK0704,241,Reni... Is she inside?
SK0704,242,No answer...
SK0704,243,Her nameplate's just a piece of notebook paper, as usual.
SK0704,244,Let's check another room.
SK0704,245,I wonder, is Sakura in her room?
SK0704,246,Yes, who is it?
SK0704,247,It's Ogami...
SK0704,248,Ogami? Thanks for going on your night watch.
SK0704,249,There's nothing unusual in my room, if you were wondering.
SK0704,250,I see. OK then, good night.
SK0704,251,OK. Good night, Ogami.
SK0704,252,She said she's already going to bed. If there's anything I need from her, I'll just bring it up tomorrow.
SK0704,253,What a cute nameplate, typical of Sakura.
SK0704,254,Let's check another room.
SK0704,255,I wonder if Kanna is inside.
SK0704,256,No answer. Did she go somewhere?
SK0704,257,Zzz... No, I couldn't eat another bite...
SK0704,258,Sounds like even Kanna's asleep.
SK0704,259,Kanna's... Well, I guess it's more of a nametag than a nameplate.
SK0704,260,OK, let's check another room.
SK0704,261,Maria? Are you there?
SK0704,262,(Maria's reading in there. I probably shouldn't call out to her.)
SK0704,263,Who is it?
SK0704,264,Um... It's Ogami.
SK0704,265,Captain? Did you need something?
SK0704,266,I'm here on my night watch.
SK0704,267,I'm here to hang out.
SK0704,268,I'm here to talk about Orihime.
SK0704,269,I'm here on my night watch. Noticed anything unusual?
SK0704,270,Good work, sir. Nothing particularly out of the ordinary here.
SK0704,271,I'm reading right now, but I'll be going to bed in a moment.
SK0704,272,Got it. All right then, good night, Maria.
SK0704,273,Good night, Captain.
SK0704,274,Right, back to the night watch, then.
SK0704,275,I'm here to hang out. Thought you might be feeling a little bored.
SK0704,276,Sir, isn't it time for your night watch?
SK0704,277,Besides, I'll be going to bed after I've finished reading a little more.
SK0704,278,O-OK...
SK0704,279,Oh well. Guess I'll continue on my night watch.
SK0704,280,Actually... I'm here to talk to you about Orihime.
SK0704,281,...I see. So you've noticed too, haven't you, Captain?
SK0704,282,Wait right there, I'm opening the door.
SK0704,283,Orihime has indeed been acting strangely since noon. She didn't even come down for dinner...
SK0704,284,Hmm... What do you think we should do?
SK0704,285,I think it'll be up to you to do something, sir.
SK0704,286,The Flower Division is at its best when the hearts of its members and its captain are as one.
SK0704,287,So long as Orihime keeps shutting herself off from you, the problem won't be solved.
SK0704,288,And the one who'll get her to open up is... you, sir. You're the only one who can.
SK0704,289,...
SK0704,290,It'll be all right, Captain. I know you can do it. Have a little faith.
SK0704,291,Right then, I'll be going now. I'll do some more reading then go to sleep.
SK0704,292,Good night, Captain. Good luck on your night watch.
SK0704,293,So it really is all up to me, huh?
SK0704,294,Orihime... I wonder if she'll even listen to me?
SK0704,295,Are you on your night watch, sir? If so, there's nothing unusual in my room.
SK0704,296,I'm reading right now, but I'll be going to bed in a moment.
SK0704,297,I-I see. All right, good night, Maria.
SK0704,298,Good night, Captain.
SK0704,299,Right, back to the night watch, then.
SK0704,300,It's Maria's nameplate.
SK0704,301,OK, onto the next room.
SK0704,302,Iris... Is she inside?
SK0704,303,No answer...
SK0704,304,So Iris's nameplate is shaped like Jean-Paul.
SK0704,305,Let's check another room.
SK0704,306,I wonder if Kohran is inside.
SK0704,307,No answer...
SK0704,308,A gear-shaped nameplate, huh? It's just Kohran's style.
SK0704,309,Let's check another room.
SK0704,310,I wonder if Sumire is inside.
SK0704,311,Doesn't look like Sumire's in.
SK0704,312,...Who is it?
SK0704,313,It's Ogami...
SK0704,314,I have no desire to speak with a peeping tom.
SK0704,315,(Oh boy, she really is mad.)
SK0704,316,(I'll just make her angrier if I persist, so I'll just leave her be.)
SK0704,317,Yes, who is it?
SK0704,318,It's Ogami...
SK0704,319,Oh, Ensign, on your night watch, are you? Good work.
SK0704,320,There's nothing unusual in my room.
SK0704,321,I was just about to go to bed myself. Good night, Ensign.
SK0704,322,OK, good night.
SK0704,323,Right, time to get back to my night watch.
SK0704,324,Sumire said she's going to bed already. I should leave her alone.
SK0704,325,This is a pretty subtle design, considering it's Sumire.
SK0704,326,Let's check another room.
SK0704,327,Past ten already, huh? I should call it here.
SK0704,328,OK, guess I'll go talk to Orihime now.
SK0704,329,Nobody's here, and everything seems normal. Better get going.
SK0704,330,Even when all the humans are asleep, the machines down here never stop working.
SK0704,331,Right, I should get back to work on my night watch, myself.
SK0704,332,It feels like a hospital at nighttime here, I don't like it.
SK0704,333,Nothing out of the ordinary here. I should get going.
SK0704,334,Looks like no one's taking a bath right now.
SK0704,335,I'll go to a different room. I wonder where everyone else is?
SK0704,336,Smells nice here, like soap... Sumire was just taking a bath here earlier, right?
SK0704,337,I'm starting to feel kinda funny... I should get back to my patrol.
SK0704,338,Huh? Looks like someone's in the bathroom.
SK0704,339,These are... Sumire's clothes.
SK0704,340,So that means... Sumire's in the bath right now...
SK0704,341,My body is moving towards the bathroom on its own...
SK0704,342,Go back outside.
SK0704,343,Oh no, my body is moving towards the bathroom on its own...
SK0704,344,Ahh, this feels so good. There's nothing better than a bath after a rehearsal.
SK0704,345,(Sumire...)
SK0704,346,(Hmm, I can't see very well through all this steam. Maybe if I get a little closer...)
SK0704,347,(C-Crap!)
SK0704,348,...! Who goes there?!
SK0704,349,Make an excuse.
SK0704,350,Run away.
SK0704,351,Make an excuse.
SK0704,352,S-Sumire... I can explain.
SK0704,353,E-Ensign?!
SK0704,354,I was on my night watch, so I thought I'd check the bathroom for anything unusual, and--
SK0704,355,E-Enough of your excuses! Get out this instant!!
SK0704,356,Y-Yes, ma'am!
SK0704,357,...
SK0704,358,I'm sorry, Sumire. I walked in without thinking...
SK0704,359,Sorry" isn't good enough!
SK0704,360,I can't believe you'd walk in on a lady in the middle of her bath!
SK0704,361,I know... I really am sorry.
SK0704,362,...And here I thought you were different from other men, that you were a true gentleman.
SK0704,363,What a shame. Now then, I have to go.
SK0704,364,Serves me right, I guess... Man, I screwed up.
SK0704,365,I don't feel great, but I guess I'll just go back to my rounds for now.
SK0704,366,(I gotta get out of here before she sees me!)
SK0704,367,Phew, I think I got away before she realized I was there.
SK0704,368,If I'd been just a moment slower, I might not have made it. That was too close...
SK0704,369,Ah... Uhm... I...
SK0704,370,E-Ensign?!
SK0704,371,H-Hey, Sumire... Fancy meeting you here.
SK0704,372,Wh-What are you saying?!
SK0704,373,Get out! Get out this instant!
SK0704,374,Y-Yes, ma'am!
SK0704,375,...
SK0704,376,I'm sorry, Sumire. I walked in without thinking...
SK0704,377,Sorry" isn't good enough!
SK0704,378,I can't believe you'd walk in on a lady in the middle of her bath!
SK0704,379,I know... I really am sorry.
SK0704,380,...And here I thought you were different from other men, that you were a true gentleman.
SK0704,381,What a shame. Now then, I have to go.
SK0704,382,Serves me right, I guess... Man, I screwed up.
SK0704,383,I don't feel great, but I guess I'll just go back to my rounds for now.
SK0704,384,She must be relaxing in the bath after working hard at rehearsal.
SK0704,385,I should go. I wouldn't want to bother her.
SK0704,386,OK, doesn't seem like Sumire noticed I'm here.
SK0704,387,I'm still on patrol, so I should go somewhere else.
SK0704,388,Phew, that was refreshing.
SK0704,389,I suppose I should be getting out.
SK0704,390,(Oh crap!! It looks like she's getting out of the water!)
SK0704,391,(I gotta get out of here before she sees me!)
SK0704,392,Phew, I think I got away before she realized I was there.
SK0704,393,If I'd been just a moment slower, I might not have made it. That was too close...
SK0704,394,Ah, Ensign.
SK0704,395,H-Hey, Sumire. Uh... Were you in the bath just now?
SK0704,396,Yes. I washed off all the sweat I worked up during rehearsal and I'm feeling refreshed.
SK0704,397,Perhaps you should take a bath too, Ensign? You seem to be working up quite the sweat yourself.
SK0704,398,No, I'm still on patrol, so I'll do it later.
SK0704,399,I see. Well then, I'll be taking my leave.
SK0704,400,Take care, Ensign. Good luck on your night watch.
SK0704,401,I should do as Sumire says and get back to my night watch in earnest.
SK0704,402,Looks like no one's taking a bath right now.
SK0704,403,I'll go to a different room. I wonder where everyone else is?
SK0704,404,Apparently the pool down here can heat up the water using underground boilers.
SK0704,405,Leave it to the Imperial Theater to have a pool you can use even during the winter.
SK0704,406,The training room... Nobody's here at the moment.
SK0704,407,Well, nothing unusual here. Onto the next stop.
SK0704,408,It's a total mess in here, as usual.
SK0704,409,Nothing unusual here, apart from the smell of roses. Right, onto the next room.
SK0704,410,G-Good evening.
SK0704,411,Oh my, Ensign Ogami. What did you need at this hour?
SK0704,412,Uh, I'm here on my night watch.
SK0704,413,Oh, good work. We were just about to start our debriefing.
SK0704,414,You should join us, Ichiro!
SK0704,415,We can talk all about beauty while we sip on this rose tea Kiku prepared for us.
SK0704,416,O-Ogami... If you don't mind... I'd like you to have some.
SK0704,417,It's so cold and lonely this time of year... You can stay here if you'd like, Ichiro.
SK0704,418,I'll be sure to steal a kiss from you by sunrise!
SK0704,419,Y-Yokihiko! You... You can't do that!
SK0704,420,That's right, Yokihiko! Ensign Ogami belongs to everyone!
SK0704,421,I... I'm in the middle of my night watch, so... I have to go.
SK0704,422,Ah, Ichiro!
SK0704,423,Sheesh... I was in trouble for a second, there.
SK0704,424,At any rate, better pull myself together and continue my night watch.
SK0704,425,Now then, let's begin the debriefing.
SK0704,426,It's fall already, don't you think we should come up with a new theme to match the season?
SK0704,427,Fall is a gloomy season, so we should display our beauty with a more somber mood.
SK0704,428,Um... I think... We should try something a bit different...
SK0704,429,All right then, we'll make this the topic of today's discussion.
SK0704,430,(Wh-What on earth are they even talking about...?)
SK0704,431,Oh, but fall means we definitely have to...
SK0704,432,B-But... I think...
SK0704,433,So basically, to sum things up...
SK0704,434,(They seem to be deep in conversation, so... I think I'll just go.)
SK0704,435,Kohran... You're always working so hard on maintaining the Koubu.
SK0704,436,Oh, Chief. You too, with your night watch.
SK0704,437,Seriously, thanks for always taking the time to chat with me.
SK0704,438,I brought some manju today. Ya want some?
SK0704,439,Manju? Well, since you offered, why not?
SK0704,440,...Wow, delicious! These manju are great, Kohran!
SK0704,441,I bought 'em from Tsurukamedo. Glad to hear you like 'em.
SK0704,442,By the way, you really like the Koubu, huh?
SK0704,443,We humans have to eat food and take baths, right?
SK0704,444,It's the exact same with the Koubu. 
SK0704,445,You keep 'em nice and clean, and once they're finished fighting, you give 'em a good meal.
SK0704,446,I'm just doing the obvious, that's all.
SK0704,447,Still, I'm sure the Koubu are very happy that you do so much for them.
SK0704,448,Heheh, well they ARE called Koubu, it's only natural they'd be Kou-verjoyed! 
SK0704,449,Ahahahaha!
SK0704,450,Oh, a wise guy, eh?
SK0704,451,Ahahahaha!
SK0704,452,Ahahaha! You're hilarious, Kohran!
SK0704,453,Really? You thought that was funny? Heheh, I'm glad it hit!
SK0704,454,...Ahahaha! Th-That was really funny!
SK0704,455,Hmm, it took you a while to laugh at that one.
SK0704,456,Y-You're just imagining things.
SK0704,457,If you say so... I was hoping you'd laugh a bit more, though.
SK0704,458,Oh, a wise guy, eh?
SK0704,459,Aww, I've done it again!
SK0704,460,Ahahaha! That was a perfect straight-man response, Chief!
SK0704,461,Looks like you finally found your comedic footing!
SK0704,462,...N-No good, huh? I just came up with it on the spot, but I still thought it was kinda funny...
SK0704,463,Hmm... That wasn't very funny.
SK0704,464,Hmm... Guess it wasn't inspired enough.
SK0704,465,Alrighty then, we had ourselves a nice break, time to get back to work.
SK0704,466,Thanks for the manju. I'll be getting back to my night watch now.
SK0704,467,Let's both give it all we've got, Chief!
SK0704,468,Sure thing. See you later, Kohran.
SK0704,469,Well... I ought to get going, too.
SK0704,470,Oh, hey Chief. Thanks for going on patrol for us.
SK0704,471,Don't overdo it, Kohran. You stay up too late and you'll catch a cold.
SK0704,472,Thanks, Chief.
SK0704,473,All right, I'm gonna get back to work. Good luck with your rounds!
SK0704,474,Looks like Kohran's still working.
SK0704,475,I should get back to my night watch, too.
SK0704,476,Past ten already, huh? I should call it here.
SK0704,477,OK, guess I'll go talk to Orihime now.
SK0704,478,I wonder if Orihime will even listen to me?
SK0704,479,...Who is it?
SK0704,480,It's Ogami. There's something I wanted to talk to you about.
SK0704,481,HE asked you to come talk to me, didn't he?
SK0704,482,I don't have anything to say to you, Ensign!
SK0704,483,Orihime...
SK0704,484,(I can't back down, not now!)
SK0704,485,(I have to open this door and talk to her!)
SK0704,486,(Now's not the time to be looking at that.)
SK0704,487,(I can't leave Orihime alone like this.)
SK0704,488,Orihime... Please open the door.
SK0704,489,No.
SK0704,490,Orihime, please, listen to me!
SK0704,491,No means no!
SK0704,492,Orihime... If you won't listen to me, then please let me hear your side of the story.
SK0704,493,Could you tell me what you think about your father?
SK0704,494,You're so stubborn! This has nothing to do with you!
SK0704,495,Actually, it does!
SK0704,496,You're right, it doesn't, but...
SK0704,497,Actually, it does! I can't leave one of my partners in the Flower Division alone like this!
SK0704,498,Partner this, partner that... You're a broken record!
SK0704,499,I don't recall ever being partners with Japanese men!
SK0704,500,You're right. I have nothing to do with your family, not directly.
SK0704,501,But I'm worried about you! Isn't that reason enough?!
SK0704,502,Ensign...
SK0704,503,...No matter what you say, I'm not opening this door.
SK0704,504,...Ensign? Are you still there?!
SK0704,505,I already told you, I'm not opening this door!
SK0704,506,Orihime, please!
SK0704,507,That's cowardly of you, Orhime!
SK0704,508,Orihime, please! Open the door!
SK0704,509,Argh, shut up! I don't want to hear another word!
SK0704,510,Orihime!
SK0704,511,...
SK0704,512,That's cowardly of you, Orihime! If you truly believe what you think is right, then say it to my face!
SK0704,513,...I don't care what you say, I don't feel like talking to any Japanese men!
SK0704,514,Orihime!
SK0704,515,Argh, shut up! I don't want to hear another word!
SK0704,516,Orihime!
SK0704,517,...
SK0704,518,Hmph! Giving me the silent treatment now, are you?
SK0704,519,Ah, thank goodness! Finally some peace and quiet.
SK0704,520,Give up and leave.
SK0704,521,Oh well. It's late. I'll go back to my room for tonight.
SK0704,522,But Orihime, I want you to know one thing.
SK0704,523,I don't think it's right to hate your father like this forever.
SK0704,524,I just want to help you and your father patch things up, that's all.
SK0704,525,All right, I'll be going now. Good night, Orihime.
SK0704,526,...
SK0704,527,...
SK0704,528,...Are you still there, Ensign?
SK0704,529,Yeah. I'm not leaving here until you open this door.
SK0704,530,Fine then, you can wait out there till morning.
SK0704,531,...
SK0704,532,Why don't you just give up already, Ensign?
SK0704,533,And why don't you just give up and open the door already?
SK0704,534,Hmph!
SK0704,535,...
SK0704,536,No matter how long you stick around, Ensign, I'm not opening this door.
SK0704,537,It's late, just go to bed already. You're being a nuisance.
SK0704,538,Oh well. You're right, it's late. I'll go back to my room for tonight.
SK0704,539,But Orihime, I want you to know one thing.
SK0704,540,I don't think it's right to hate your father like this forever.
SK0704,541,I just want to help you and your father patch things up, that's all.
SK0704,542,All right, I'll be going now. Good night, Orihime.
SK0704,543,...
SK0704,544,...
SK0704,545,Sheesh... You really are stubborn, you know that?
SK0704,546,...Come on in.
SK0704,547,Thanks, Orhine.
SK0704,548,All right, so what did you want to talk to me about, anyway?
SK0704,549,Ask about Carino.
SK0704,550,Ask about Ogata.
SK0704,551,If you don't mind, could you tell me more about Carino?
SK0704,552,I don't know what that man told you, Ensign...
SK0704,553,But it's his fault that Mamma became so sad...
SK0704,554,Mamma... She tried so hard not to cry in front of me...
SK0704,555,But she was always crying whenever she was alone.
SK0704,556,All because of him... All because he wasn't faithful...
SK0704,557,There's no way I could ever forgive him!
SK0704,558,I'll never forgive him for making Mamma so sad... Never!
SK0704,559,Orihime, you called him "unfaithful" just now...
SK0704,560,But it seemed to me like Mr. Ogata truly loved Carino.
SK0704,561,He's tricking you, Ensign!
SK0704,562,It's obvious he's lying about loving Mamma!
SK0704,563,You were separated from your father when you were just a child, right, Orhime?
SK0704,564,So how do you know Mr. Ogata is your father?
SK0704,565,...Before I came to Japan, Mamma gave me a photograph.
SK0704,566,She must've wanted me to make him apologize, if I ever met him.
SK0704,567,There, is that good enough for you? Now go back to your room, Ensign!
SK0704,568,Orihime, can't you patch things up with Mr. Ogata?
SK0704,569,Of course not! He's the man who abandoned Mamma and I!
SK0704,570,Now please leave, Ensign!
SK0704,571,...
SK0704,572,Orihime...
SK0704,573,It's like Kayama said, the only way to get the two of them to make up is for them to talk to each other.
SK0704,574,Is there really nothing I can do?
SK0704,575,I have no right to call myself her father.
SK0704,576,I... I won't be fooled by him! Never!
SK0704,577,...
SK0704,578,If only there was a way I could get them to talk face to face...
SK0704,579,I know! I'll take Orihime to see Mr. Ogata tomorrow, by force if I have to!
SK0704,580,That's all I CAN do. All right, I'll just have to try!
SK0704,581,Sorry, Ogami, but each customer is only allowed to purchase one photo at a time.
SK0704,582,I see. That's too bad.
SK0704,583,Sorry, Ogami, but each customer is only allowed to purchase one photo at a time.

SK0705,1,You're hurting me, Ensign! You don't have to be so aggressive!
SK0705,2,I'm sorry, Orihime, but you have to come with me, even by force if I have to.
SK0705,3,You have to talk to Mr. Ogata.
SK0705,4,Cut it out! I want nothing to do with him!
SK0705,5,You can't talk about your father that way, Orihime!
SK0705,6,It's because of him and your mother that you're even here, right?
SK0705,7,You should have an honest conversation with him.
SK0705,8,...
SK0705,9,All right, we're here.
SK0705,10,...Mr. Ogata.
SK0705,11,Hello there, Ogami... Ah!
SK0705,12,Orihime...
SK0705,13,...
SK0705,14,I'll be waiting over there, Orihime, so you two have a nice, long chat.
SK0705,15,...
SK0705,16,Orihime...
SK0705,17,Don't say my name so casually! You don't have the right!
SK0705,18,Ahh, Orihime, even the way you get angry reminds me of your mother...
SK0705,19,Quit messing with me!!
SK0705,20,You abandoned Mamma and I for 17 years!
SK0705,21,And NOW you want to act like my father? Don't you think about anyone but yourself?!
SK0705,22,...You're right, I have no right to call myself your father.
SK0705,23,But if nothing else, believe me when I say this...
SK0705,24,I've never stopped loving you or your mother... Carino.
SK0705,25,That's a lie! Your words mean nothing!
SK0705,26,I don't believe a single thing you're saying!
SK0705,27,Orihime...
SK0705,28,Not another word! I don't want to hear it! Why don't you just... disappear?!
SK0705,29,Wh-What was that?!
SK0705,30,Heheheh... How droll...
SK0705,31,It's you, Kasha!
SK0705,32,I can make that man disappear, young miss, just like you wanted.
SK0705,33,Of course, you'll disappear right alongside him...
SK0705,34,Urk...
SK0705,35,Ugh... Ori... hime...
SK0705,36,Hold on!
SK0705,37,Why? Why did you protect me?!
SK0705,38,Protecting his daughter... is what any father would do.
SK0705,39,Besides, Carino would... be furious with me... if I let you get hurt.
SK0705,40,Papa...
SK0705,41,Thank you, Orihime... You... You actually... called me "Papa"...
SK0705,42,Orihime! Mr. Ogata! Are you all right?!
SK0705,43,Oh my, it seems we have more trash.
SK0705,44,...!! It's you, Kasha!
SK0705,45,Seems like you're just a bit too late. I've already claimed these two.
SK0705,46,What? What do you plan to do with them?!
SK0705,47,Trash must be burned, of course. However, I'll make it the ultimate spectacle. Heheheh...
SK0705,48,Urgh. You coward!
SK0705,49,Ensign. I'll be all right.
SK0705,50,Hurry, go and get the others!
SK0705,51,But Orihime, what... what about you?!
SK0705,52,I'm staying here.
SK0705,53,I can't... I can't leave my papa behind!
SK0705,54,Orihime...

SK0705,56,I can't leave you here!
SK0705,57,...OK. I'll head to the theater right away.

SK0705,59,OK... Ensign...
SK0705,60,Don't be silly! I can't just leave you here!
SK0705,61,I'm the captain of the Flower Division. I could never leave my comrades behind!
SK0705,62,Ensign... Just knowing you feel that way is enough for me.
SK0705,63,But you have a duty to keep the capital safe! Please, go!
SK0705,64,Orihime...
SK0705,65,OK, but I'll come right back to save you! Just hold on, Orihime!
SK0705,66,What are you doing, Ensign?!
SK0705,67,You have to keep the capital safe! Go, now!
SK0705,68,Orihime...
SK0705,69,OK, but I'll come right back to save you! Just hold on, Orihime!
SK0705,70,Heheheh... Think you can make it back before I turn this trash into ash?
SK0705,71,I'll save Orihime, you'll see.
SK0705,72,And when I do, it'll be the end for you, Kasha. Prepare yourself!!

SK0708,1,I'll put the flowers right here, Papa.
SK0708,2,OK. Thank you, Orihime.
SK0708,3,But still, talk about a dramatic change.
SK0708,4,To think this is the same Orihime who'd always call Japanese men "spineless" or "stupid"...
SK0708,5,E-Ensign! That's ancient history! Forget about that already!
SK0708,6,It just goes to show, Japanese men are indelicato!
SK0708,7,Hahaha... There's the Orihime I know.
SK0708,8,...
SK0708,9,By the way, I have a favor I'd like to ask of you two...
SK0708,10,Seeing you two together like this has given me the sudden urge to draw.
SK0708,11,Once I get discharged from the hospital, would you two model for me?
SK0708,12,Huh?!
SK0708,13,I know it'd make for a great picture.
SK0708,14,Papa...
SK0708,15,Ogami, once again, please look after Orihime for me.
SK0708,16,Yes, sir!
SK0708,17,Ahh... However, if you ever plan on marrying Orihime, you'd better prepare yourself.
SK0708,18,After all, I'm sure you've noticed how strong-willed Italian women can be.
SK0708,19,...R-Right.
SK0708,20,Oh, stop it, Papa! Talking about marriage... Heeheehee!
SK0708,21,Sorry, Ogami, but each customer is only allowed to purchase one photo at a time.
SK0708,22,I see. That's too bad.

SK0802,3,...!
SK0802,4,Gunshots?!
SK0802,5,Jump out of bed.
SK0802,6,This is horrible!!
SK0802,7,I need to hurry! Where is everyone?!
SK0802,8,Nothing seems to be out of the ordinary, but..
SK0802,9,I knew it, that's gunfire! It's coming from the first floor!
SK0802,10,Ogami!
SK0802,11,That voice...
SK0802,12,Ogami! Are you all right?!
SK0802,13,Sakura! What in the world is happening?
SK0802,14,...
SK0802,15,Acting hastily could be dangerous for us. Let's wait and see how it goes.
SK0802,16,...!
SK0802,17,Ogami! Ogami, wake up!
SK0802,18,S-Sakura?!
SK0802,19,Ogami, please open up! Quick!!
SK0802,20,Got it! Right away!!
SK0802,21,Sakura, what in the world is happening?!
SK0802,22,I don't know... I rushed here as soon as I heard those gunshots.
SK0802,23,What about the others?!
SK0802,24,They went down to the first floor with Kaede.
SK0802,25,I see...
SK0802,26,There should be people on the second floor! Sweep the area!!
SK0802,27,...!
SK0802,28,Ogami! Someone's coming!
SK0802,29,Run.
SK0802,30,Wait and see.
SK0802,31,Sakura, we need to run! Gather with everyone immediately!
SK0802,32,Yes, sir!
SK0802,33,Wait... If we're not careful, we might get into more danger.
SK0802,34,Even if we wait to see who's coming after us, we'll still have time to run.
SK0802,35,Right, understood.
SK0802,36,S-Sakura, what do we do?!
SK0802,37,Ogami! What're you saying?!
SK0802,38,In times like this, you're supposed to be the one to make the important decisions.
SK0802,39,B-But...
SK0802,40,Let's run, Ogami. We need to meet up with everyone first.
SK0802,41,...!
SK0802,42,There they are! Over here!
SK0802,43,Ah!
SK0802,44,There! It's Sakura Shinguji! Open fire!
SK0802,45,You missed! Continue firing!
SK0802,46,This is bad! Run, Sakura!
SK0802,47,Y-Yes!
SK0802,48,Major Amakasa, we've managed to occupy the lobby, dining hall, and seating area!
SK0802,49,We're currently taking over the second floor as well. The operation has been going smoothly! 
SK0802,50,Don't get careless. Our efforts will be meaningless if we don't occupy the whole theater.
SK0802,51,Yes, sir!
SK0802,52,Our objectives are: One, to occupy the backbone of the Imperial Assault Troupe, their command room!
SK0802,53,Yes, sir! The basement squad's operation is going smoothly as well.
SK0802,54,Two, special mission from His Excellency: to restraint, or to assasinate Sakura Shinguji!
SK0802,55,Yes, sir!
SK0802,56,The time for the Army has finally come, to rule this rotten Japan.
SK0802,57,Your Excellency... We will fulfill our restoration soon!
SK0802,58,We managed to run from the second floor.
SK0802,59,Ogami, those people are wearing Army uniforms.
SK0802,60,Why are those Army soldiers attacking us?!
SK0802,61,Hmm...
SK0802,62,...! Ogami, Sakura!! There you are!
SK0802,63,Mr. Yoneda!
SK0802,64,Are you fine, you two?
SK0802,65,You too, Manager. Thank goodness you're fine!
SK0802,66,Mr. Yoneda...
SK0802,67,What on earth...
SK0802,68,How's everyone?
SK0802,69,What on earth...
SK0802,70,I don't really get the situation, but I get a hunch about this.
SK0802,71,How's everyone? Where are they?
SK0802,72,I dunno. I only caught up with you two.
SK0802,73,But I'm sure they're all doing fine.
SK0802,74,Everyone...
SK0802,75,...
SK0802,76,...
SK0802,77,Ogami, get yourself together! Don't just standing idly in times like this!
SK0802,78,R-Right!
SK0802,79,Those raiders are in Army uniforms. You saw them too, right?
SK0802,80,This might be their attempt to do coup d'etat.
SK0802,81,A coup d'etat?!
SK0802,82,Occupying main government institutions to have their power...
SK0802,83,In a nutshell, these people are trying to take over the country.
SK0802,84,There's no doubt that they've already attacked various places of the city, just like the theater.
SK0802,85,N-No way!
SK0802,86,Ogami, Sakura, I'm gonna give you orders.
SK0802,87,You need to run away from here, both of you.
SK0802,88,Huh?!
SK0802,89,We can't!
SK0802,90,What about everyone else?!
SK0802,91,We can't just run away just by ourselves!
SK0802,92,Idiot! This isn't the time to say that!
SK0802,93,Co-Commander...
SK0802,94,What about everyone else?! You too, Commander!
SK0802,95,All of us run and this theater will fall into their hands!
SK0802,96,This is a vital point of Tokyo's defense! There's no way I'll give it to them!
SK0802,97,Commander...
SK0802,98,...
SK0802,99,I know how you feel, Ogami, but this is something only you can do.
SK0802,100,Now listen carefully. These are extremely crucial orders so that Tokyo can survive.
SK0802,101,R-Right!
SK0802,102,First, secure the Pandemonium Regalia. You can find it at the storeroom.
SK0802,103,Then, board the Thunderstrike and escape to the Hanayashiki Branch.
SK0802,104,Lastly... This is the most important one.
SK0802,105,The enemies are after Sakura. Protect her at all cost.
SK0802,106,The Pandemonium Regalia?
SK0802,107,Why go to Hanayashiki?
SK0802,108,Why Sakura?
SK0802,109,...The Pandemonium Regalia?
SK0802,110,The set of Japan's ultimate ritual items, compromised of...
SK0802,111,A sword, a jewel, and a mirror.
SK0802,112,If a righteous person wields them, they will have the power of righteousness.
SK0802,113,If an evil person wield them, they will have the power of evil. The Regalia amplify their wielder's power.
SK0802,114,Two years ago, Yamazaki... Cerulean Satan took them away for his own ambition.
SK0802,115,We managed to get them back through a harsh battle...
SK0802,116,and now they're being secured in the theater's underground.
SK0802,117,We absolutely can't let these guys have Pandemonium Regalia.
SK0802,118,Secure them, and run to the Hanayashiki Branch at all cost. Got it?
SK0802,119,Why do we have to head to Hanayashiki?
SK0802,120,Because... There is someone waiting for you at the branch.
SK0802,121,Someone waiting for us?
SK0802,122,That's all I can say for now. Anyway, just ride the Thunderstrike to there.
SK0802,123,Why are they targeting Sakura?
SK0802,124,Sakura, mind what I'm gonna say.
SK0802,125,Shinguji Family have "Lineage of Purification" in their bloodline.
SK0802,126,Which means, they bear the "Power of Purification."
SK0802,127,Power of... Purification?
SK0802,128,With that power, we can seal any kinds of mighty demon.
SK0802,129,However... It costs the bearer's life.
SK0802,130,...!
SK0802,131,Seven years ago, in the Great Kouma War, there was a person who used that power.
SK0802,132,He sacrificed his life to seal the devil.
SK0802,133,It was Kazuma Shinguji... your father.
SK0802,134,Huh?! It can't be... Father was?!
SK0802,135,I kept silence until now, but to the evil-doers, your life is their threat.
SK0802,136,Get it, Ogami? Protect Sakura... No matter what!
SK0802,137,To keep her power... We mustn't let her die!
SK0802,138,Yes, sir!
SK0802,139,Find Sakura Shinguji! Doesn't matter even if you kill her!
SK0802,140,Hah!
SK0802,141,It'll be just a matter of time until those guys come here.
SK0802,142,Go, Ogami! Head to the basement and escape to the Hanayashiki Branch, now!
SK0802,143,Run to the basement.
SK0802,144,Understood! Watch yourself, Mr. Yoneda!
SK0802,145,Yeah, you can count on it! I won't die so easily!
SK0802,146,What are you waiting for, Ogami?! There's no time!
SK0802,147,But I...
SK0802,148,Don't worry about me and the others!
SK0802,149,Just go, Ogami! Every second counts!
SK0802,150,...Yes, sir!
SK0802,151,Let's go, Sakura!
SK0802,152,R-Right!
SK0802,153,I'm counting on you, Ogami!
SK0802,154,Please stay safe, Manager Yoneda!
SK0802,155,Dang it! Why's the Army attackin' us here?!
SK0802,156,Since we're indoors, so we can't even use our Koubu to fight back...
SK0802,157,What's more, it's awful we've been split off from the Ensign and the others.
SK0802,158,Mon Frère... Sakura... I hope they're OK...
SK0802,159,Ensign can handle himself, don't worry about him!
SK0802,160,At any rate, this position is compromised. We won't be able to hold out much longer.
SK0802,161,Maria, what do we do? Things are gonna get worse if we stick around any longer.
SK0802,162,We start pulling back, but hold them off as long as we can.
SK0802,163,(The enemy has us outmanned and outgunned.)
SK0802,164,(If it keeps up like this, it'll only be a matter of time before they occupy the entire theater.)
SK0802,165,Seems like the enemy hasn't breached the basement yet.
SK0802,166,...! That explosion just now... It came from the storeroom!
SK0802,167,Let's hurry, Sakura!
SK0802,168,R-Right!
SK0802,169,W-What?
SK0802,170,Ah! O-Ogami!
SK0802,171,Ichirooo! Sakuraaa! We've been waiting for you!
SK0802,172,Seems that these guys managed to infiltrate the basement by blowing up the wall from the outside.
SK0802,173,Their luck has run out after encountering us though, the secret Rose Division, the corps of beauty and love!
SK0802,174,G-Guys!
SK0802,175,We'll help you!
SK0802,176,Why are you in here?!
SK0802,177,We'll help you fight them off!
SK0802,178,Ogami... We're glad to hear that, but...
SK0802,179,You guys have a more important task!
SK0802,180,Why are you in here?!
SK0802,181,Looks like... our time to talk with you... has come.
SK0802,182,About our mission...
SK0802,183,We've been waiting for you, Ensign Ogami.
SK0802,184,We've been protecting the Pandemonium Regalia, and we're giving it to you!
SK0802,185,What?!
SK0802,186,Protecting Japan's ultimate sacred weapon stored beneath the Imperial Theater...
SK0802,187,The Pandemonium Regalia...
SK0802,188,has been the Rose Division's primary objective this whole time!
SK0802,189,Here, Ogami! Take it!
SK0802,190,W-What's this?
SK0802,191,It's the jewel of the Regalia. Now take it and get to Hanayashiki!
SK0802,192,The enemy won't be able to use the Regalia's power if they're missing even one of its three components!
SK0802,193,Everyone...
SK0802,194,Now go! There isn't any time!
SK0802,195,No need to worry about us, Ichiro!
SK0802,196,Ogami, Sakura... Please, hurry to the Hanayashiki Branch!
SK0802,197,Understood! Let's go, Sakura!!
SK0802,198,Y-Yes!
SK0802,199,Ogami, what's going to happen now?!
SK0802,200,I don't know...
SK0802,201,But right now, we have to hurry to Hanayashiki with the Regalia as fast as we can.
SK0802,202,For everyone's sake.
SK0802,203,...
SK0802,204,OK! The Thunderstrike is working!
SK0802,205,Let's go, Sakura! We're getting out of the Imperial Theater!
SK0802,206,Major Amakasa, I have a report!
SK0802,207,Our men have completely occupied the first and second floor of the Imperial Theater!
SK0802,208,The basement team has succeeded in breaking through their walls.
SK0802,209,They entered the underground facility, but are currently meeting stiffer resistance than expected.
SK0802,210,What about the Flower Division?
SK0802,211,They seem to have retreated deeper within and holed themselves in the command room.
SK0802,212,Heh... So we've cornered them like rats, huh?
SK0802,213,Call His Excellency. Tell him we're almost finished cleaning up the Imperial Theater.
SK0802,214,Yes, sir!
SK0802,215,Sorry, Ogami, but each customer is only allowed to purchase one photo at a time.
SK0802,216,I see. That's too bad.
SK0802,217,My apologies, Mr. Ogami, but each customer is only allowed to purchase one photo at a time.

SK0803,1,We managed to escape from the theater somehow.
SK0803,2,I wonder if everyone is OK...
SK0803,3,Come on, of course they are. I'm sure they're driving those soldiers out of the theater as we speak.
SK0803,4,OK...
SK0803,5,...Sakura.
SK0803,6,Are you still thinking about what the manager said to you?
SK0803,7,Yes, I...
SK0803,8,...
SK0803,9,Sakura...
SK0803,10,O-Ogami...
SK0803,11,...
SK0803,12,I'm here for you.
SK0803,13,I can't wait to see Hanayashiki.
SK0803,14,Sakura, I'm here for you. You don't have to worry about anything.
SK0803,15,Ogami...
SK0803,16,Power of Purification... Pandemonium Regalia... We should forget about them for a bit.
SK0803,17,Right...
SK0803,18,I can't wait to see the Hanayashiki Branch. I wonder who's waiting for us.
SK0803,19,Me too...
SK0803,20,It seems it's located under an amusement park. Let's go there when things get back to normal.
SK0803,21,...Y-Yes.
SK0803,22,Ogami... Thank you.
SK0803,23,...
SK0803,24,...
SK0803,25,Ogami... Can we stay like this for a while?
SK0803,26,Yeah, sure.
SK0803,27,Being like this really calms me down.
SK0803,28,Sakura, let's not dwell on all that and instead, let's just move forward.
SK0803,29,...Yes.
SK0803,30,OK, we're about to reach Hanayashiki.
SK0803,31,Huh, so this is their underground facility. A lot different up close compared to when we see it in the Koubu.
SK0803,32,But still, who is waiting for here?
SK0803,33,Ogami, Sakura, long time no see!
SK0803,34,Tsu-Tsubaki?! What are you doing here?
SK0803,35,Ehe! About that...
SK0803,36,Imperial Assault Troupe, Wind Division, Tsubaki Takamura! We've transported new Spirit Armor from the Hokkaido Branch!
SK0803,37,New... Spirit Armors?!
SK0803,38,Affirmative! This was the special mission I left the theater for.
SK0803,39,Now, I'll guide you to the hangar. This way, please. 
SK0803,40,Th-These are...
SK0803,41,Are these... our new Spirit Armor?!
SK0803,42,A new type of Spirit Armor to succeed the Koubu and Jinbu.
SK0803,43,They're classified as... the "Tenbu"!!
SK0803,44,Ogami! With these Tenbu...
SK0803,45,Yes, we can take back the theater!
SK0803,46,Hold it a second, Ogami!
SK0803,47,Huh?! That voice... Kayama?! Where is he?
SK0803,48,Ogami! It's coming from that Cinematron over there!
SK0803,49,Ah, being able to call people is nice, isn't it?
SK0803,50,Even though we're far apart, I can talk to you face to face. How happy it makes me!
SK0803,51,Kayama, I'm sorry, but I don't have time to talk with you right now.
SK0803,52,Now, now. Patience, Ogami. In times like this, "slow and steady wins the race."
SK0803,53,Listen. Right now, I'm hiding inside the Imperial Theater.
SK0803,54,W-What did you say?!
SK0803,55,If you want to take this place back, I'm at your service.
SK0803,56,Kayama, wait a minute. Why are you there? Just who are you?
SK0803,57,Looks like it's time to reveal the truth about me, Ogami.
SK0803,58,When the Flower Division fights on the battlefield, the Moon Division aids in the shadows.
SK0803,59,And as for the leader of the Moon Division, that would be me, Yuichi Kayama. 
SK0803,60,What?! You're captain of the Moon Division?!
SK0803,61,Yes. We don't serve on the frontlines like the Flower Division...
SK0803,62,But the Moon Division has their own ways of waging war. We don't have much time, so listen up.
SK0803,63,The enemy has control of the theater's defense curtain, and has closed off the entire building.
SK0803,64,Furthermore, they've fortified their defenses by placing artillery all over.
SK0803,65,Really? Things are getting out of hand, aren't they?
SK0803,66,This is where I come in. We don't have much time, either the artillery or the defense curtain. 
SK0803,67,I can disable one of them. Now, Ogami, which one?
SK0803,68,Remove the curtain.
SK0803,69,Disable the artillery.
SK0803,70,Remove the curtain. We want to lower their defense.
SK0803,71,The curtain it is. Understood, leave it to me!
SK0803,72,Disable the artillery. I want to at least take away some of their firepower.
SK0803,73,The artillery it is. Understood, leave it to me!
SK0803,74,The rest of the Flower Division is holed up in the underground command room.
SK0803,75,Commander Yoneda and Deputy Commander Fujieda are also giving out orders there as well.
SK0803,76,You need to meet up with them as soon as possible. Good luck, Ogami.
SK0803,77,Moon Division... Wind Division...
SK0803,78,Everyone's giving us their support!
SK0803,79,Now it's time for the Flower Division to join in, isn't it?
SK0803,80,Right. We're moving out! With our new Spirit Armor, the Tenbu, we're going to rescue our friends and take back the theater!
SK0803,81,Yes!
SK0803,82,Please proceed to the Soaring Whale! Getting you there's the Wind Division's job!
SK0803,83,Let's move out! We'll descend on Ginza and storm our besieged theater!
SK0803,84,Sorry, Ogami, but each customer is only allowed to purchase one photo at a time.
SK0803,85,I see. That's too bad.

SK0805,2,But even so, don't you think it's too quiet, Ogami?
SK0805,3,Precisely... What happened to all those soldiers?
SK0805,4,Don't let your guard down, Sakura. This might be a trap.
SK0805,5,As long as I have this sword, Arataka, I'll be OK.
SK0805,6,OK. We're coming in.
SK0805,7,Is everyone all right?! We're here to help!
SK0805,8,Aaah! Mon Frère! Sakura!!
SK0805,9,You're late! Took you long enough to get here!
SK0805,10,Hey, what happened to that bunch on upper floor? Don't tell me you finished them all by yourselves.
SK0805,11,About that... Nobody was around when we came here.
SK0805,12,What?!
SK0805,13,So many soldiers disappear... What's that supposed to be?
SK0805,14,No idea, the only we know is Mokujiki the Five Black Demons was trying to stop us.
SK0805,15,It seems that... the Black Demon Society is also involved in this incident.
SK0805,16,I knew it. We're sorry for not being able to lend help, Captain.
SK0805,17,Oh, it's fine. We have the new type of Spirit Armors with us, the Tenbu.
SK0805,18,I see. So Tenbu has been finished!
SK0805,19,A single Tenbu's equal a hundred power! With this, there's nothing to fear from Black Demon Society!
SK0805,20,Wait! Someone's there!
SK0805,21,Hehehe... Excellent as always, Imperial Assault Troupe. You're doing a splendid job.
SK0805,22,...That voice!
SK0805,23,It has been a while... Ensign Ichiro Ogami.
SK0805,24,You... Army Minister Kyogoku!
SK0805,25,Are you telling us that you're leading this coup d'etat of yours?!
SK0805,26,Heh... coup d'etat? That was rude.
SK0805,27,I'd like you to call our operation as a revolution. Taisho Revolution. 
SK0805,28,What brings you to this place?!
SK0805,29,I only came to give my regards. This kind of defense line is no use to me.
SK0805,30,Allow me to tell you, this Tokyo is already in my hands.
SK0805,31,Don't fool around!
SK0805,32,I don't, Sakura Shinguji.
SK0805,33,Open your eyes wide. Don't use your power for such a trivial matter as justice,
SK0805,34,or else you'll just wasting your life like your father.
SK0805,35,Wha... What did you just say?!
SK0805,36,You ridicule my father not just once, but twice! You'll pay for it!!
SK0805,37,Sakura!
SK0805,38,Leave!!
SK0805,39,I said leave, Keigo Kyogoku!!
SK0805,40,Heh. Can you kill people? Kill a flesh-and-blood human?
SK0805,41,If you don't want to... I'll make you leave!
SK0805,42,Haaaaaah!
SK0805,43,Wha... What?!
SK0805,44,Don't you dare to put your hands on Lord Kyogoku.
SK0805,45,De... Demon King!!
SK0805,46,Step back!
SK0805,47,It's futile... You're skill is nothing compared to mine.
SK0805,48,It'll only make this sword, Mukei, rust.
SK0805,49,Hehehe... Isn't this an amusing battle?
SK0805,50,However. We should proceed to the next place already, Demon King.
SK0805,51,...Yes.
SK0805,52,Well then, excuse us, Imperial Assault Troupe.
SK0805,53,Wait!
SK0805,54,My child... Polish your swordsmanship to the utmost.
SK0805,55,You won't be able to kill a human with your skill.
SK0805,56,...
SK0805,57,Sakura...
SK0805,58,Lord Kyogoku, the Taisho Revolutionary Army is slowly being suppressed.
SK0805,59,Why of course. What can they hope to do?
SK0805,60,It served its purpose well enough just by making chaos in Tokyo.
SK0805,61,We're done with this...
SK0805,62,I see...
SK0805,63,Then I shall proceed to release the seal that has been placed on Shinjuku.
SK0805,64,Hehehe... Soon, Tokyo will awaken it's true form...
SK0805,65,In any case, it's good to see all of you safe.
SK0805,66,But, Commander Yoneda...
SK0805,67,Yeah, I know. First, let's sort out the situation.
SK0805,68,Ogami, is there something you want to hear?
SK0805,69,Ask about Kyogoku.
SK0805,70,Ask about the coup.
SK0805,71,Ask about the Regalia.
SK0805,72,I want to ask about Kyogoku.
SK0805,73,Hm, this riot's mastermind is definitely Kyogoku.
SK0805,74,To put it worse, he came here to us with Demon King.
SK0805,75,Which means...
SK0805,76,The Black Demon Society are working under his command.
SK0805,77,Darn it, Kyogoku... To think that he would wage this outrageous thing.
SK0805,78,What's the situation with the coup army?
SK0805,79,Minister of the Navy, Yamaguchi, contacted us that navy is suppressing them.
SK0805,80,Troops arriving from Yokohama have been in contact with regiments in Fuchu and Maebashi. Now they're surrounding Tokyo.
SK0805,81,Dat so? Then it'll be just a matter of time until the coup fails.
SK0805,82,No, we can't lower our guard.
SK0805,83,Not until we apprehend the mastermind.
SK0805,84,Keigo Kyogoku...
SK0805,85,Commander Yoneda, about the other Regalia...
SK0805,86,Right now... Those army are taking them.
SK0805,87,We apologize... Even though we were holding the enemy...
SK0805,88,Come on, we managed to secure the jewel thanks to your quick wit.
SK0805,89,We just need to retrieve what has been taken. That's all.
SK0805,90,...
SK0805,91,Commander Yoneda,
SK0805,92,If you don't mind... Please tell me more about the Pandemonium Regalia.
SK0805,93,And also... about the Power of Purification.
SK0805,94,Sakura...
SK0805,95,...
SK0805,96,...All right.
SK0805,97,The Pandemonium Regalia... The ultimate sacred items that amplify the power of their wielder.
SK0805,98,There were two people who used them during this Taisho Era...
SK0805,99,One of them was Cerulean Satan... Who used to be known as Shinnosuke Yamazaki.
SK0805,100,Two years ago, he used the power of Regalia...
SK0805,101,...to resurrect the ancient city, the Sacred Demon Castle, which was sunk deep underwater. It's still fresh in my memory.
SK0805,102,Another person was Kazuma Shinguji. He was your father, Sakura...
SK0805,103,...
SK0805,104,Seven years ago... When a Kouma appeared in Nihonbashi during the Great Kouma War...
SK0805,105,Kazuma... used the Power of Purification with help from Regalia's power.
SK0805,106,It's the power that inflict unimaginable burden to its user's mind and body.
SK0805,107,Kazuma departed from his life three months after that war...
SK0805,108,The Pandemonium Regalia's power is beyond human...
SK0805,109,We can't let the Black Demon Society have such dangerous items!
SK0805,110,That's why, Ichiro, we beg you!
SK0805,111,The Pandemonium Regalia... The Pandemonium Regalia...
SK0805,112,Everyone...
SK0805,113,Roger that!
SK0805,114,But, where are the other Regalia?
SK0805,115,Roger that! We'll definitely take the Regalia back to us!
SK0805,116,Ensign Ogami... Thank you very much!
SK0805,117,I'll give you a kiss after you get them!
SK0805,118,Please... Do your best everyone!
SK0805,119,But, we know nothing about their whereabouts.
SK0805,120,No need to worry about that. The Regalia releases a strong spirit power.
SK0805,121,If we can locate their transmission point...
SK0805,122,We can quickly find their location!
SK0805,123,I-I see...
SK0805,124,We still have the jewel with us.
SK0805,125,The Black Demon Society shouldn't be able to do anything since they missing one of the Regalia. It's not a game over!
SK0805,126,The rest of Regalia... Two items we couldn't protect...
SK0805,127,Ichiro... Make sure to retrieve them, OK?
SK0805,128,Y-Yes.
SK0805,129,Commander Yoneda! The Spirit Power Radar from Steam Processor...
SK0805,130,Has detected a strong presence of spirit power!
SK0805,131,Is that so?! Where's it located?!
SK0805,132,It's in Shinjuku. It's possible that it came from the other Regalia!
SK0805,133,Hm, so it's finally our turn to show up.
SK0805,134,Now, Ogami! Give your order!
SK0805,135,Imperial Assault Troupe, move out!
SK0805,136,We're taking back the Pandemonium Regalia!
SK0805,137,Imperial Assault Troupe, move out! Our destination is Shinjuku!
SK0805,138,Roger!
SK0805,139,We're counting on you, Ogami!
SK0805,140,Everyone... We're gonna take back the Regalia, without fail!
SK0805,141,Roger!
SK0805,142,Ensign Ogami...
SK0805,143,And everyone at Flower Division...
SK0805,144,Please take care of the Pandemonium Regalia!
SK0805,145,Hey Ogami! What do you dozing off?!
SK0805,146,Ah... S-Sorry!
SK0805,147,Imperial Assault Troop, move out! Our destination is...
SK0805,148,Err... What was it again?
SK0805,149,It's Shinjuku, Ogami... Get yourself together.
SK0805,150,Oh brother... Now I'm worried about how it goes. 
SK0805,151,OK, start the Tenbu! We're gonna take the Pandemonium Regalia back from Kyogoku!
SK0805,152,Sorry, Ogami, but each customer is only allowed to purchase one photo at a time.

SK0807,1,Great work, everyone! You managed to retrieve the rest of the Pandemonium Regalia.
SK0807,2,Thank you, sir!
SK0807,3,Uh-huh... So this is that "Regalia" thing, huh?
SK0807,4,Affirmative.
SK0807,5,The sword...
SK0807,6,The mirror...
SK0807,7,And the jewel...
SK0807,8,Because of these things, Yamazaki... and Kazuma...
SK0807,9,...
SK0807,10,My father... With the Pandemonium Regalia, he used the Power of Purification...
SK0807,11,And that power... is also flowing in my veins.
SK0807,12,Sakura...
SK0807,13,...
SK0807,14,I need to... to be alone.
SK0807,15,I'm sorry for sounding selfish... But please...
SK0807,16,...
SK0807,17,Come on, everyone... Let's go.
SK0807,18,Sakura...
SK0807,19,People are helpless before power...
SK0807,20,There are those who are attracted to it and lust for more...
SK0807,21,There are those who devote themselves to it for the sake of their loved ones...
SK0807,22,And there are those who suffer in the face of it, perplexed by its presence. Sakura is the latter right now...
SK0807,23,...
SK0807,24,Ogami, I must ask you something.
SK0807,25,Yes... What is it?
SK0807,26,To protect Tokyo and your comrades in the Flower Division...
SK0807,27,Those are your priorities as captain; to do what must be done.
SK0807,28,Are you confident in your ability to do that?
SK0807,29,Of course I am!
SK0807,30,I'm trying.
SK0807,31,I'm not.
SK0807,32,Of course I am!
SK0807,33,I will protect the capital and my friends!
SK0807,34,Well said, Ogami. That's what makes you captain of the Flower Division.
SK0807,35,I'm trying to...
SK0807,36,Believe in yourself, Ogami.
SK0807,37,Your actions and your words give us all confidence.
SK0807,38,I'm trying, but I don't think I can...
SK0807,39,Ogami, your actions and your words give us all confidence.
SK0807,40,I know all of you can get through this. Believe in yourself, Ogami.
SK0807,41,...
SK0807,42,Well, I'm sure it's hard to come up with a definitive answer right now.
SK0807,43,That said, I know you can do what is necessary.
SK0807,44,Sacrificing one's life in order to protect everyone...
SK0807,45,Like what Kazuma Shinguji did, that was our only option we had back then.
SK0807,46,But now, it's different. You can protect everyone with your own power.
SK0807,47,You don't need to rely on the Regalia. 
SK0807,48,Ogami, please tell this to Sakura.
SK0807,49,We don't need the Pandemonium Regalia...
SK0807,50,And we won't need her Power of Purification.
SK0807,51,As long as we combine our own strength, there's nothing to fear.
SK0807,52,...
SK0807,53,I understand.
SK0807,54,But I...
SK0807,55,I understand.
SK0807,56,But I...
SK0807,57,Keep it together, Ogami.
SK0807,58,Only you can save Sakura from her doubt and pain...
SK0807,59,...
SK0807,60,Please talk to her, Ogami.
SK0807,61,...Yes.
SK0807,62,...
SK0807,63,Go, Ogami.
SK0807,64,Only you can save Sakura from her doubt and pain...
SK0807,65,...
SK0807,66,Please talk to her, Ogami.
SK0807,67,...Yes.
SK0807,68,All right then, I'll go talk to her a bit.
SK0807,69,Thank you. I'm counting on you.
SK0807,70,Sakura...
SK0807,71,Ogami...
SK0807,72,If I use this Power of Purification, the evil we're fighting will be purged and peace will prevail.
SK0807,73,No one has to be hurt or suffer anymore.
SK0807,74,If I sacrifice just myself, it'll all be over and people will smile again...
SK0807,75,Sakura...
SK0807,76,But...
SK0807,77,I... I can't die now! I don't want to go!
SK0807,78,I want to be with someone I love, just like a normal girl! I want to stay with everyone!! 
SK0807,79,Ogami... Am I being selfish?
SK0807,80,Sakura...
SK0807,81,Embrace her.
SK0807,82,Sakura!
SK0807,83,Ogami...
SK0807,84,Sakura.
SK0807,85,Ogami! Ogamiii!!
SK0807,86,Sakura...
SK0807,87,...
SK0807,88,Sakura, you're not going to die alone. I won't let it happen.
SK0807,89,This Regalia has been the source of all kinds of suffering, time and time again.
SK0807,90,If it's gone, no one will be able to use its power; neither good or evil.
SK0807,91,That's why... I'm going to destroy it!
SK0807,92,Huh?! Ogami...
SK0807,93,I can still protect everyone, even without relying on this thing's power!
SK0807,94,I can protect Tokyo, protect its people's happiness, and I will protect you, Sakura.
SK0807,95,Ogami...
SK0807,96,Ogami!
SK0807,97,S-Sakura...
SK0807,98,Ogami, please! Hold me tight and don't let go!
SK0807,99,If you don't, I... I don't know what I'll do! I feel like I might die!!
SK0807,100,...
SK0807,101,Everything's going to be all right, Sakura. You don't to have to suffer anymore.
SK0807,102,I've made up my mind. I'm going to destroy the Regalia!
SK0807,103,Huh?! O-Ogami?!
SK0807,104,This Regalia has been the source of all kinds of suffering, time and time again.
SK0807,105,I can still protect everyone, even without relying on this thing's power!
SK0807,106,I can protect Tokyo, protect its people's happiness, and I will protect you, Sakura.
SK0807,107,Ogami...
SK0807,108,Ogami...
SK0807,109,Sakura, there's no need to worry.
SK0807,110,Think about it. Too much blood has been shed for this Regalia.
SK0807,111,Colonel Kazuma Shinguji...
SK0807,112,Cerulean Satan... No, Major Yamazaki...
SK0807,113,And even Ayame...
SK0807,114,I won't let the same thing happen to you!
SK0807,115,We'll protect what we love most with our own power! I'm ending this once and for all!!
SK0807,116,Ogamiii!!
SK0807,117,Aaaaaaagh!
SK0807,118,...Aah!!
SK0807,119,I did it! I did it!!
SK0807,120,The Pandemonium Regalia... has been shattered to pieces...
SK0807,121,Now there's no need for you to sacrifice yourself.
SK0807,122,Ogami...
SK0807,123,Sakura...?
SK0807,124,Ogami...
SK0807,125,I... I...
SK0807,126,Ogami, you did all that for me...
SK0807,127,but now I'm afraid. Was that truly what was best for everyone else?
SK0807,128,I'm so heartless! I'm selfish for that, right?
SK0807,129,Sakura...
SK0807,130,Ogami... This is truly for the best, right?
SK0807,131,I'm allowed to... be together with you and everyone else, right?
SK0807,132,Of course you are! We don't need to be sittin' around debating it.
SK0807,133,I don't know anything about this Regalia thing, but it has nothing to do with us.
SK0807,134,I couldn't possibly allow you to become the sole heroine of a tragedy like that.
SK0807,135,Together, we make the Flower Division! We're not gonna let anyone get left behind.
SK0807,136,That's right! Come on, Sakura. Smile, smile!
SK0807,137,E-Everyone...
SK0807,138,Our fight isn't over yet.
SK0807,139,Yes. She's right, Sakura.
SK0807,140,Sakura...
SK0807,141,Come on, we're doing this together!
SK0807,142,We're going to protect everyone!
SK0807,143,Come on, we're doing this together! We're all part of the Flower Division.
SK0807,144,Yes!
SK0807,145,I have my friends! I have the Flower Division with me! I'm not hesitating any longer!
SK0807,146,Sakura...
SK0807,147,OK. All pilots, board the Soaring Whale! Our destination is Akasaka. We're heading to the Black Demon Society's base!
SK0807,148,We're not fighting with the Pandemonium Regalia or the Power of Purification. We'll use our own power.
SK0807,149,This time, we're protecting everyone with our own strength!
SK0807,150,Roger!
SK0807,151,I'll fight with you! So that we may achieve true peace!
SK0807,152,Yeah! That's the spirit, Sakura!
SK0807,153,OK. All pilots, board the Soaring Whale! Our destination is Akasaka. We're heading to the Black Demon Society's base!
SK0807,154,Ogami, I'm not hesitating any longer.
SK0807,155,I have everyone. Everyone in the Flower Division, my friends!
SK0807,156,For their sake... and for the sake of peace, I'll give it my all!
SK0807,157,OK. All pilots, board the Soaring Whale! Our destination is Akasaka. We're heading to the Black Demon Society's base!
SK0807,158,We're right above Akasaka.
SK0807,159,The Black Demon Society's base... I wonder just which part of Akasaka it's located.
SK0807,160,We just received a transmission from Kayama.
SK0807,161,Moon Division reports that there's a large cave system stretching underneath Akasaka.
SK0807,162,Apparently, their base is located in the deepest part.
SK0807,163,The Soaring Whale will be unable to aid us while we're underground. This may turn out to be a difficult battle.
SK0807,164,According to intel, it seems that we can infiltrate their base from the rear.
SK0807,165,Entering the rear may be a bit of detour, but it won't be as heavily guarded.
SK0807,166,Or, we can rush through the frontlines where the enemy's forces are concentrated.
SK0807,167,Now, Ogami. Please decide our plan of attack.
SK0807,168,Sneak around the back

SK0807,170,We'll sneak around the back. I'd like to choose the least dangerous option.
SK0807,171,Understood. We'll direct the Soaring Whale to that location.
SK0807,172,We'll go with a frontal assault. Even if there are a few enemies, the Tenbu should be able to break through.
SK0807,173,Understood. We'll direct the Soaring Whale to that location.
SK0807,174,We're counting on you, Ogami!
SK0807,175,Imperial Assault Troupe, move out!
SK0807,176,We're definitely going to win!
SK0807,177,Imperial Assault Troupe, move out! Our target is the Society's base under Akasaka!
SK0807,178,Roger!
SK0807,179,Bring it on, Black Demon Society! This will be our last fight!
SK0807,180,This will be our final battle. Everyone, let's win this!
SK0807,181,Yeaaah!!
SK0807,182,Bring it on, Black Demon Society! We'll show you the might of the Imperial Assault Troupe's Flower Division!
SK0807,183,...
SK0807,184,Everyone, I don't have much of anything special to say.
SK0807,185,I trust in our power, so have faith and fight on!

SK0808,3,Boss, we finally did it! We won!
SK0808,4,We protected the capital from the Black Demon Society!
SK0808,5,...Yeah!
SK0808,6,OK, everyone, let's head back.
SK0808,7,Back to the theater, our home.
SK0808,8,OK! Flower Division, returning to the Grand Imperial Theater!
SK0808,9,Roger!
SK0808,10,We finally got back to our Imperial Theater...
SK0808,11,It's only been a day, but it already feels like it's been ages.
SK0808,12,Ogami, thank you for your hard work.
SK0808,13,Bringing all the Flower Division together, you have my gratitude.
SK0808,14,No, it was nothing...
SK0808,15,Seems the Taisho Restoration Army's coup has finally been put down.
SK0808,16,With that, Tokyo is calm once again. Great job, Ogami.
SK0808,17,Th-Thank you very much!
SK0808,18,Ogami... Truly, thank you for everything.
SK0808,19,Because of you, and everyone else, I can continue to be here!
SK0808,20,That's right. Let's keep doing our best, Sakura.
SK0808,21,Living a bright and happy life is the best, Sakura!
SK0808,22,Oh, I sure like that topic. Life's all about living it to the fullest after all. Hahaha!
SK0808,23,Hey, everyone! Let's do our usual thing!
SK0808,24,...I agree.
SK0808,25,Yeah, yeah! It won't feel like a mission accomplished unless we do that!
SK0808,26,I must agree. This time, why don't you take the lead, Ensign?
SK0808,27,Huh, me?
SK0808,28,Please, wait for a second!
SK0808,29,Aren't forgetting us, the Rose Division?
SK0808,30,W-We would like to... join you... as well...
SK0808,31,OK, everyone come on in! We need to have fun in our lives! All right, Ogami, say it!
SK0808,32,Right. OK now, one... two...
SK0808,33,Victory pose, yeah!!
SK0808,34,Victory pose, yeah!!
SK0808,35,...I-I'm too embarrassed to say it.
SK0808,36,Victory pose, yeah!!
SK0808,37,...I-I'm too embarrassed to say it.
SK0808,38,Oh brother, you're certainly an odd fellow at times.
SK0808,39,Guess I'll do it. Let's go! One, two...
SK0808,40,Victory pose, yeah!!
SK0808,41,Hey, hey, Ogami. Don't just stay silent, are you doing it or not?
SK0808,42,I-I'm sorry. I'm still not used to this I guess.
SK0808,43,I know! How about you do it, Kaede?
SK0808,44,Huh? Me?!
SK0808,45,Yaaay!! Auntie Kaede, do it, do it!
SK0808,46,OK, shall we... do it now?
SK0808,47,OK, here we go. One, two...
SK0808,48,Victory pose, yeah!!
SK0808,49,Meanwhile, the coup army was suppressed and began to surrender one after another.
SK0808,50,The enlisted men who had joined the uprising rejoined their original units.
SK0808,51,All of the commissioned officers, including Amakasa, surrendered and were arrested.
SK0808,52,The mastermind behind the coup d'état, Keigo Kyogoku...
SK0808,53,was found dead in his home, having committed suicide with his own pistol.
SK0808,54,Thus, the drama of rebellion that unfolded on the stage of a snowy Tokyo...
SK0808,55,came to an unexpected conclusion.
SK0808,56,And once again, peace returned to the streets of Tokyo.
SK0808,57,Several long months of struggle fighting the Black Demon Society had come to an end...
SK0808,58,And the Flower Division welcomed peace back into their lives.
SK0808,59,It was the winter of Taisho 14...

SK0901,1,To think, the year's almost over.
SK0901,2,You're right. It's already December and the weather's gotten really frigid.
SK0901,3,I'm already not an early bird, so this season's always hard for me.
SK0901,4,Lower temperatures tend to slow down the body's ability to move as well.
SK0901,5,But if it snows, we can build snowmen or have a snowball fight.
SK0901,6,It'll be loads of fun!
SK0901,7,Everyone here seems to have different opinions on winter, eh?
SK0901,8,What about you, Chief, do you like winter?
SK0901,9,I like winter.
SK0901,10,I don't like winter...
SK0901,11,I like it. The cold never bothered me much.
SK0901,12,Huh... What's so great about winter?
SK0901,13,Well...
SK0901,14,Winter games.
SK0901,15,Hot pots.
SK0901,16,Kotatsu and oranges?
SK0901,17,There's all kinds of games you can play in the winter.
SK0901,18,Yeah! Snowball fights are the best!
SK0901,19,Sports such as skiing and skating can only be enjoyed in winter as well.
SK0901,20,Uh-huh... Is that all?
SK0901,21,Hot pots are great. Just having everyone gather around the fire is fun.
SK0901,22,Hot pot?
SK0901,23,We gather around a boiling pot of broth and cook all sorts of food by dipping them in it.
SK0901,24,Yeah! It tastes really good and warms your body up!
SK0901,25,And above all else, it's fun gathering around and eating with everyone else.
SK0901,26,Ooh, is that so?
SK0901,27,I kind of like to just laze around under a kotatsu and eat some oranges.
SK0901,28,Ehehe. Oh, Ogami! It is true though.
SK0901,29,Kotatsu? What's that?
SK0901,30,A kotatsu is... Well, uh... It's covered with a heavy blanket, and... 
SK0901,31,Um... It's kind of hard to explain.
SK0901,32,A kotatsu is a Japanese heating device.
SK0901,33,It's a table covered with a blanket. You burn charcoal briquettes in a pit underneath it to warm your body.
SK0901,34,Well, when we put the kotatsu out, you'll understand once you try it.
SK0901,35,Uh... Now that I think of it, I don't really know what's so great about winter.
SK0901,36,At least it's better than summer, I guess?
SK0901,37,What a boring answer.
SK0901,38,I feel like an idiot for asking that.
SK0901,39,I don't like winter. It's cold, so...
SK0901,40,Tee-hee! You can't stand the cold!
SK0901,41,But on the bright side, winter makes all kinds of food taste more delicious.
SK0901,42,Yeah! Hot pot with everyone gathered around is the best!
SK0901,43,Ah, winter. Huh... I can't say whether I like it or not.
SK0901,44,Traveling all over the world on that training voyage...
SK0901,45,It made me realize that Japan's four seasons are all beautiful. It's hard to choose a favorite myself.
SK0901,46,Right. I also like each of Japan's four seasons.
SK0901,47,To me, winter is my favorite. It's the season where I can enjoy all kinds of kimonos. 
SK0901,48,Heh, just like how a bagworm wraps themselves up in the winter.
SK0901,49,You're one to talk, gobbling up all those extra meals lately. Are you getting ready to hibernate or something?
SK0901,50,Now you've done it, Sumire. After so long, you picking fights with me again?
SK0901,51,Oh goodness, you two never change.
SK0901,52,We're going to be rehearsing for our Christmas performance. Behave yourselves.
SK0901,53,Christmas performance?
SK0901,54,Yes. It's called "The Miracle Bells."
SK0901,55,It's a special one night only performance on Christmas Eve.
SK0901,56,It's about the miracle that happened on Christmas and the main lead will play the Holy Mother.
SK0901,57,I can't wait.
SK0901,58,Who's the main lead?
SK0901,59,A special performance only for one night, huh? I can't wait.
SK0901,60,This will be the Flower Division's last performance for this year.
SK0901,61,Everyone is excited to give a spectacular performance, so look forward to it.
SK0901,62,By the way, who's going to be the lead for this play?
SK0901,63,Well, you see...
SK0901,64,Hm?
SK0901,65,We already have candidates for the role...
SK0901,66,But we still haven't made the final decision on who gets to play the Holy Mother.
SK0901,67,Oh...
SK0901,68,Mon Frère, we'll do our best...
SK0901,69,So do your best for the play, too. Ok?
SK0901,70,Me?
SK0901,71,I-Iris!
SK0901,72,Oh...
SK0901,73,You meant to wish him luck at his job as ticket puncher for the play, right, Iris?
SK0901,74,Y-Yeah! Good luck, Mon Frère!
SK0901,75,All right, everyone. It's time to begin our rehearsal.
SK0901,76,OK! Bring it on!
SK0901,77,Well, Captain, we must be off.
SK0901,78,Feel free to take a look later, Ogami.
SK0901,79,Christmas performance, huh? I wonder what kind of play it'll end up being.
SK0901,80,Ogami.
SK0901,81,Need something, Kaede?
SK0901,82,There's something I want to talk to you about.
SK0901,83,Can you come to my room in about 30 minutes?
SK0901,84,30 minutes, that'll be 4:45 PM, then.
SK0901,85,Yes. I'll be waiting for you.
SK0901,86,I wonder what Kaede wants to talk about.
SK0901,87,For now, I'll just walk around the theater to kill some time.

SK0902,7,Talk to Tsubaki.
SK0902,8,Leave.
SK0902,9,Could I buy a photo?
SK0902,10,Sorry, Ogami. I can only sell one photo to a customer per month.
SK0902,11,Please understand, we need to keep some for the other patrons.
SK0902,12,You'd like to buy a photo? Thank you very much!
SK0902,13,That's a photo of Sakura.
SK0902,14,Let's see... Sakura's photo, right?
SK0902,15,That'll be 50 sen. Thank you very much!
SK0902,16,That's a photo of Sumire.
SK0902,17,Let's see... Sumire's photo, right?
SK0902,18,That'll be 50 sen. Thank you very much!
SK0902,19,That's a photo of Maria.
SK0902,20,Let's see... Maria's photo, right?
SK0902,21,That'll be 50 sen. Thank you very much!
SK0902,22,That's a photo of Kanna.
SK0902,23,Let's see... Kanna's photo, right?
SK0902,24,That'll be 50 sen. Thank you very much!
SK0902,25,That's a photo of Iris.
SK0902,26,Let's see... Iris's photo, right?
SK0902,27,That'll be 50 sen. Thank you very much!
SK0902,28,That's a photo of Kohran.
SK0902,29,Let's see... Kohran's photo, right?
SK0902,30,That'll be 50 sen. Thank you very much!
SK0902,31,That's a photo of Orihime.
SK0902,32,Let's see... Orihime's photo, right?
SK0902,33,That'll be 50 sen. Thank you very much!
SK0902,34,That's Reni's photo.
SK0902,35,Let's see... Reni's photo, right?
SK0902,36,That'll be 50 sen. Thank you very much!
SK0902,37,Oh, so you're not going to buy any?
SK0902,38,It's been a while since the last time you worked here, Tsubaki.
SK0902,39,Yep, it's been a while, but I'm back now.
SK0902,40,When you contacted me in Hokkaido...
SK0902,41,Your message was really encouraging. Thank you very much!
SK0902,42,Aw, it's not a big deal.
SK0902,43,Anyway, how does it feel to be back at the gift shop?
SK0902,44,Even though I was only gone for a little bit, it feels like forever ago.
SK0902,45,Getting back here after just a few months...
SK0902,46,My heart was swelling. I shouted to myself "I'm finally home!"
SK0902,47,Tsubaki...
SK0902,48,I'll never forget that feeling, I'm determined to work even harder now!
SK0902,49,Take care, Ogami!
SK0902,50,Yeah, likewise.
SK0902,51,Looks like Tsubomi worked hard while I was away, didn't she?
SK0902,52,Yeah, although she was a bit clumsy.
SK0902,53,Oh, by the way, Tsubomi now works in the dining hall.
SK0902,54,Be sure to say hi to her.
SK0902,55,At first, when I received orders to go to Hokkaido, I felt really nervous...
SK0902,56,But thanks to you contacting me, I had a great experience there. I'm glad that I went.
SK0902,57,Well, I should be going. Keep up the good work.
SK0902,58,Thank you very much! Come back soon!
SK0902,59,Tsubaki is putting in her best effort.
SK0902,60,OK, I'm gonna do my best to punch tickets as well!
SK0902,61,Thank you very much! Come back and buy another photo next month!
SK0902,62,Tsubaki is putting in her best effort.
SK0902,63,OK, I'm gonna do my best to punch tickets as well!
SK0902,64,Ah, Ogami! Good afternoon!
SK0902,65,Tsu-Tsubomi?! What's with that outfit?
SK0902,66,Starting today, I'm working in the dining hall!
SK0902,67,Tsubaki came back to run the gift shop!
SK0902,68,Being a server is wonderful! I get to see the customers' smiles on their face as I do my job!
SK0902,69,I see. Good luck, Tsubomi.
SK0902,70,Yes! Thank you very much!
SK0902,71,...Huh? I think I smell something burning.
SK0902,72,Aaah! I left a pot on the stove!
SK0902,73,Hey, Tsubomi, kitchen is over here! Not there!
SK0902,74,Aaahh! I took the wrong way! Thank you very much, and excuse me!
SK0902,75,Oh boy... She's acting just like her usual self.
SK0902,76,Ah, Ogami! Good afternoon!
SK0902,77,Tsubomi... The theater is closed, do we still have guests?
SK0902,78,No, but it's OK. This is a good chance for me to train.
SK0902,79,I'm planning to become the perfect server for our Christmas performance!
SK0902,80,I see, isn't that great. Good luck, then.
SK0902,81,Thanks! Please come again!
SK0902,82,Hahaha, Tsubomi is full of spirit.
SK0902,83,I should work hard as a ticket puncher, too.
SK0902,84,No one's in the kitchen.
SK0902,85,Everyone must be at the stage right now.
SK0902,86,The theater is closed until Christmas, so this room is closed too.
SK0902,87,I hope we'll get a lot of guests come showtime.
SK0902,88,Oh, do you need something, Ogami?
SK0902,89,You're gonna listen to my gossip, right, Ogami?
SK0902,90,My, you came here like clockwork, Ogami.
SK0902,91,If you're interested in hearing more rumors, I'm all out. Sorry.
SK0902,92,I see... That's too bad.
SK0902,93,I'll have some more interesting tidbits for you another time, so look forward to it!
SK0902,94,Hello, Yuri, Kasumi.
SK0902,95,Oh, hello, Ogami. Is there something you need?
SK0902,96,I've got plenty of new, juicy gossip for you. Ask away!
SK0902,97,Listen to some rumors.
SK0902,98,I'll come back later.
SK0902,99,Keigo Kyogoku... To think that he would end his own life!
SK0902,100,Right, no one had saw that ending coming.
SK0902,101,Still, who would have thought that he had a connection with the Black Demon Society?
SK0902,102,I was shocked too. No one would have guessed that the Army Minister led an evil organization like that.
SK0902,103,Guess it's like they say, truth is stranger than fiction.
SK0902,104,It's been a month since then and the Army has settled down.
SK0902,105,A new minister has been appointed, and Kyogoku's officers have been purged.
SK0902,106,Is that so? That's great.
SK0902,107,Boy, it was really snowy back when that coup happened.
SK0902,108,It said that a lot of political turmoil happens in Japan when it snows.
SK0902,109,The revenge of the 47 ronin... The Sakuradamon Incident... All of them happened on snowy days.
SK0902,110,I see... Now that you mention it, it's true.
SK0902,111,Thank goodness that last month's attempt ended before it spread too far.
SK0902,112,To think, Tsubaki went to Hokkaido to transport the Tenbu...
SK0902,113,Why wasn't I the one to go? We're both Wind Division.
SK0902,114,Tsubaki is less experienced than us, maybe that's why?
SK0902,115,Anyone would grow after a mission like that.
SK0902,116,Well, since you put it that way, you're right.
SK0902,117,Hmph. But still, it's Hokkaido... I envy her.
SK0902,118,I was wondering, Ogami, what do you know about sailor suits?
SK0902,119,They're clothes that seamen wear onboard ships. I wore one during my training.
SK0902,120,Why do you ask?
SK0902,121,The thing is, sailor suits have gotten very popular as schoolgirl uniforms recently.
SK0902,122,Huh?! Is that true?
SK0902,123,It seems that a lot of private schools in Tokyo have already adopted them as their uniform.
SK0902,124,We might see the city overflowing with schoolgirls in sailor suits pretty soon.
SK0902,125,I see... You never know what's going to be the next trend.
SK0902,126,I heard that back when the coup happened, traffic in Tokyo was brought to a standstill.
SK0902,127,Yeah, that's right. The railroads were completely buried under snow.
SK0902,128,Tokyo has a reputation for being weak to snow.
SK0902,129,Not much to be done about that. Heavy snow like that rarely ever happens here.
SK0902,130,Ogami, have you ever heard of something called "television"?
SK0902,131,Television"?
SK0902,132,I read about it in the newspaper. It's a device that sends movies across electro-magnetic waves.
SK0902,133,The article said that the first test broadcast in England was a success...
SK0902,134,and in the future, there will be broadcasting stations like we have with radios.
SK0902,135,Oh, I see. That'll be just like Kohran's Cinematron.
SK0902,136,Seems like Kohran's ahead of the curve compared to England. 
SK0902,137,Get this, Nippon Railway has began operating the "Yamanote Loop Line."
SK0902,138,Oh yeah! The "Yamanote Line."
SK0902,139,Now we can easily go to places that used to be hard to reach. It's really convenient.
SK0902,140,I heard that it was really crowded on the first day.
SK0902,141,Why don't you try riding the train, Ogami?
SK0902,142,You're right. I'll try to ride it sometime.
SK0902,143,If you're interested in hearing more rumors, I'm all out. Sorry.
SK0902,144,I see... That's too bad.
SK0902,145,I'll have some more interesting tidbits for you another time, so look forward to it!
SK0902,146,I'll be back. Good luck with the rest of your work.
SK0902,147,OK. Thanks for coming, Ogami.
SK0902,148,Tell us if you hear any juicy stories!
SK0902,149,OK, now... Where should I go next?
SK0902,150,I wonder if Mr. Yoneda is in here. 
SK0902,151,I better check another room, I guess.
SK0902,152,It's Ogami. Mr. Yoneda, are you there?
SK0902,153,Oh, Ogami. Yeah, come on in.
SK0902,154,Right. Pardon me.
SK0902,155,Yo, Ogami. Need something?
SK0902,156,No, nothing in particular. What are you doing, sir?
SK0902,157,Me? I'm thinking about Kyogoku...
SK0902,158,Keigo Kyogoku... Just what was he trying to accomplish?
SK0902,159,What do you think, Ogami?
SK0902,160,To take over Japan?
SK0902,161,Reasons unknown...
SK0902,162,Seize the Regalia?
SK0902,163,Do you think he wanted to take over Japan?
SK0902,164,Mmm, likely. Given that he was pushing militarism for such a long time.
SK0902,165,But even so, to think he'd orchestrate a coup... 
SK0902,166,Such an extreme measure from an ordinarily cautious man.
SK0902,167,...
SK0902,168,Perhaps he had other motives we simply don't know about.
SK0902,169,Mm-hmm. It's definitely a possibility.
SK0902,170,But, he's dead now. The truth may never be unveiled.
SK0902,171,...
SK0902,172,Could it be he intended to steal the Pandemonium Regalia?
SK0902,173,But if so, why he leave the theater with only two of them?
SK0902,174,Now that you mentioned it, you're right...
SK0902,175,If his intention was to prevent us from using the Regalia, then it makes sense.
SK0902,176,In other words,to prevent Sakura from using her Power of Purification.
SK0902,177,If that were so, then seizing only two of them was enough.
SK0902,178,I see... That may be possible.
SK0902,179,But, he's dead now. The truth may never be unveiled.
SK0902,180,...
SK0902,181,I can't think of a reason...
SK0902,182,I see... Now that he's dead, seems the truth died with him.
SK0902,183,However, this conclusion isn't satisfying.
SK0902,184,I don't believe him to be the kind of man to die that way.
SK0902,185,...
SK0902,186,Whoops, sorry to make you listen to me for so long.
SK0902,187,No need to worry about it, Ogami. Just give your all into the Christmas performance for now.
SK0902,188,Right, understood.
SK0902,189,Kyogoku's objective, huh...
SK0902,190,Now I'm wondering what was he up to...
SK0902,191,Ogami, I want to be alone for a bit.
SK0902,192,I'd like to contemplate on some matters.
SK0902,193,...Yes, sir. Understood.
SK0902,194,(Yoneda... He's concerned about Kyogoku's actions.)
SK0902,195,I thought they were doing some song rehearsals, but no one's here.
SK0902,196,I should just go to another room.
SK0902,197,Oh, Captain.
SK0902,198,Yo. Need something, Boss?
SK0902,199,Oh, Kanna, Reni. What are you doing in here?
SK0902,200,We're writing down material orders to make costumes for "Miracle Bells."
SK0902,201,We're using special-ordered materials for the Holy Mother and supporting angels' costumes.
SK0902,202,Uh-huh... I can't wait for it.
SK0902,203,Hehe, me too. What kind of costumes do you think they'll be, Boss?
SK0902,204,Beautiful costumes.
SK0902,205,Flashy costumes.
SK0902,206,Men's costumes.
SK0902,207,I bet you guys are gonna wear beautiful costumes.
SK0902,208,Yeah. We're gonna wear really beautiful costumes that fit with the Christmas theme.
SK0902,209,I bet you guys are gonna wear flashy costumes.
SK0902,210,Nah, we won't do that. If anything, they'll be pretty modest.
SK0902,211,If you two are gonna wear them, I bet they'll be men's costumes.
SK0902,212,Hey, hey, we're not the only ones who're gonna wear them, Boss.
SK0902,213,We're going to be wearing beautiful women's costumes, you know.
SK0902,214,Oh, now that you say it like that, guess that was a bit rude.
SK0902,215,But, if you're looking at just us two, I can see why you'd think that.
SK0902,216,Hey, Reni, don't say that. Jeez...
SK0902,217,So, what kind of costumes are you going to wear?
SK0902,218,I have no idea. What kind of costumes are you going to wear?
SK0902,219,Haha, it's a bit hard for you to tell, ain't it?
SK0902,220,We're wearing the most beautiful costumes to go with the holiday.
SK0902,221,After discussing it with the group, we decided on making them emanate purity.
SK0902,222,Thing is, the main lead still hasn't been decided yet...
SK0902,223,I see... I wonder who it'll be.
SK0902,224,Well, that's...
SK0902,225,...
SK0902,226,Sorry, Boss. We're still in the middle of work here.
SK0902,227,Could you let us get back to our job, please?
SK0902,228,Right, sorry to disturb you.
SK0902,229,Later, Boss.
SK0902,230,Hmm. For some reason, when the lead role came up, they got all quiet.
SK0902,231,Anyway, I better head to another room so I won't get in their way.
SK0902,232,The total cost of materials for the angel costumes would be...
SK0902,233,Reni... Don't you get sleepy after working with your thinkin' cap on for so long?
SK0902,234,That won't be a problem as long you stay focus.
SK0902,235,(Hahaha... Those two are working hard.)
SK0902,236,They're focused on their work, let's not bother them.
SK0902,237,Now... Let's go somewhere else.
SK0902,238,Ah, Mon Frère!
SK0902,239,My...
SK0902,240,What're you two doing?
SK0902,241,Maria and the others are preparing for the show, so we're taking a rest.
SK0902,242,We're talking about birthdays right now!
SK0902,243,We're holding the Christmas performance on December 24th...
SK0902,244,And we have a member whose birthday is on that day. Do you know who is it?
SK0902,245,Sakura?
SK0902,246,Kohran?
SK0902,247,Iris?
SK0902,248,Sumire?
SK0902,249,Orihime?
SK0902,250,Reni?
SK0902,251,Uh... Sakura?
SK0902,252,Wrong answer! Sakura's birthday is July 28th!
SK0902,253,December 24th is Reni's birthday.
SK0902,254,Oh, is that so?
SK0902,255,Uh... Kohran?
SK0902,256,Wrong answer! Kohran's birthday is March 3rd!
SK0902,257,December 24th is Reni's birthday.
SK0902,258,Oh, is that so?
SK0902,259,Uh... is it yours, Iris?
SK0902,260,Mine is July 5th, Mon Frère!
SK0902,261,I-Is it? Whoops.
SK0902,262,Ohohohoho... You seem to have forgotten about her birthday.
SK0902,263,Oooh, I hate you, Mon Frère!
SK0902,264,Bleeeh!
SK0902,265,(Oh boy, that was bad.)
SK0902,266,December 24th is Reni's birthday, Ensign.
SK0902,267,Oh, is that so?
SK0902,268,Uh... is it yours, Sumire?
SK0902,269,That's wrong, Ensign! Are you telling me that you forgot when my birthday is?!
SK0902,270,My birthday is January 8th!
SK0902,271,I-Is it? Whoops.
SK0902,272,Jeez, forgetting my birthday, that's beyond rude.
SK0902,273,December 24th is Reni's birthday, Mon Frère.
SK0902,274,Oh, is that so?
SK0902,275,Uh... Orihime?
SK0902,276,Wrong answer! Orihime's birthday is July 7th!
SK0902,277,December 24th is Reni's birthday.
SK0902,278,Oh, is that so?
SK0902,279,Uh... Reni?
SK0902,280,Correct! Way to go, Mon Frère!
SK0902,281,Hahaha, of course. I'm the captain.
SK0902,282,Time's up! Too bad, Mon Frère.
SK0902,283,December 24th is Reni's birthday, Ensign.
SK0902,284,Oh, is that so?
SK0902,285,What a coincidence, to think that her birthday is on the same day as the performance.
SK0902,286,Perhaps we should throw a celebration for her that day.
SK0902,287,Let's do it! Let's have a birthday party for her!
SK0902,288,I see... Good idea.
SK0902,289,Keep it a secret from Reni, OK?
SK0902,290,Hahaha... Got it.
SK0902,291,So the performance will be on the same day as Reni's birthday.
SK0902,292,It's looking like the 24th will be a very busy day. 
SK0902,293,So, Sumire, what kind of birthday party should we have?
SK0902,294,We can hold it during the closing party, and...
SK0902,295,(Looks like they're talking about Reni's birthday party.)
SK0902,296,Let's not interrupt them.
SK0902,297,Now... Where should I head next?
SK0902,298,Kohran, I want to measure the length right here. Can you help me?
SK0902,299,Oh, OK. Wait up, I'm coming.
SK0902,300,Hm? Those voices, it's Maria and Kohran.
SK0902,301,Looks like they're doing something on the stage.
SK0902,302,How many meters is there, Maria?
SK0902,303,5 meters and 45 centimeters. Or about 5 and a half meters.
SK0902,304,Those two are working hard...
SK0902,305,Looks like arranging stage sets are a lot of work.
SK0902,306,Huh? Look who's coming.
SK0902,307,Ah, Ogami!
SK0902,308,Are you preparing props for the play?
SK0902,309,Yes. We're inspecting the props and sets for "The Miracle Bells."
SK0902,310,We have three weeks until the performance.
SK0902,311,I see... It's December already, huh. 
SK0902,312,Oh, right. Now that it's December, I just remembered something I wanted to ask.
SK0902,313,I heard that this month has another name in the old Japanese calendar.
SK0902,314,What's it called?
SK0902,315,Shisou.
SK0902,316,Shiwasu.
SK0902,317,Shibashiri.
SK0902,318,It's called "Shisou."
SK0902,319,Oh... "Shisou", huh?
SK0902,320,O-Ogami, you got it wrong!
SK0902,321,The 12th month of the lunisolar calendar is called "Shiwasu."
SK0902,322,Oh, so you lied, huh? Pretending like you know everything isn't very nice, you know.
SK0902,323,I-Is it? Whoops.
SK0902,324,It's called "Shiwasu."
SK0902,325,Oh... "Shiwasu", huh?
SK0902,326,It's called "Shibashiri."
SK0902,327,Oh... "Shibashiri", huh?
SK0902,328,O-Ogami, you got it wrong!
SK0902,329,The 12th month of the lunisolar calendar is called "Shiwasu."
SK0902,330,Oh, so you lied, huh? Pretending like you know everything isn't very nice, you know.
SK0902,331,I-Is it? Whoops.
SK0902,332,Uh... What was it called again?
SK0902,333,It's called "Shiwasu", the 12th month on the old lunisolar calendar.
SK0902,334,Oh... "Shiwasu", huh?
SK0902,335,You get a chance to learn something new too, Ensign. How nice for you.
SK0902,336,Ah, haha... You're right.
SK0902,337,It's said that in the past, the 12th month was the busiest time for schools. Even the teachers were dashing around.
SK0902,338,Which is why it's called "Shiwasu", or "dashing teachers." I wonder how true it really is.
SK0902,339,Well, this month we're also busy with the performance, so it must be true!
SK0902,340,Hehe, you do have a point.
SK0902,341,Well, let's go back to our tasks now, Orihime.
SK0902,342,OK, got it!
SK0902,343,I'm going now. Keep up the good work, guys.
SK0902,344,OK. Thanks for stopping by.
SK0902,345,December, huh... So much has happened this year...
SK0902,346,As the final play this year, I hope the Christmas performance will be as big a success as any.
SK0902,347,Sakura, this tree prop is broken.
SK0902,348,The tree prop is damaged... OK, thanks for letting me know.
SK0902,349,(Looks like those two are inspecting the stuff back there.)
SK0902,350,Better not to interrupt them.
SK0902,351,Now then, where should I spend my time next?
SK0902,352,Maria, how about we put this set a little bit more forward?
SK0902,353,Right. With the proper lighting, that spot would work better.
SK0902,354,Great work, you two.
SK0902,355,Oh, Captain.
SK0902,356,Are you preparing the stage for "The Miracle Bells"?
SK0902,357,Yes. Just a little before we start rehearsal...
SK0902,358,Well, what we're doing is more like "pre-preparing" rather than preparing.
SK0902,359,Hehe, right, Maria?
SK0902,360,Um.... Heh, yeah.
SK0902,361,Why only pre-preparation?
SK0902,362,I can't wait.
SK0902,363,Why only pre-preparation?
SK0902,364,I can't wait.
SK0902,365,Are you hiding something?
SK0902,366,Why only pre-preparation?
SK0902,367,That's because, you know, the final parts of the set will be done by a certain person.
SK0902,368,Kohran...
SK0902,369,Uh-oh. The rest is still a secret.
SK0902,370,Captain, we still have some work to do, so... 
SK0902,371,If you don't mind, could you look on the others as well?
SK0902,372,Right, good idea! Everyone else is in the dressing or prop room.
SK0902,373,Anyway, thanks for visiting us, Captain.
SK0902,374,Somehow I feel like I'm being driven out...
SK0902,375,Anyway, I guess I should go to another room.
SK0902,376,I can't wait to see what kind of set it will be.
SK0902,377,Ahaha, I think so too. How about you, Maria?
SK0902,378,Heh, I agree.
SK0902,379,'Kay then, let's get back to work.
SK0902,380,Well, Captain. I'm afraid we have to get back to work.
SK0902,381,Yeah, good luck.
SK0902,382,Everyone has been working really hard for the Christmas performance.
SK0902,383,I should practice my ticket collecting...
SK0902,384,Are you two hiding something? The way you're laughing is making me curious.
SK0902,385,Huh? Chief... You're a sharp one.
SK0902,386,Kohran, don't say anything about that for now.
SK0902,387,Captain, we still have some work to do, so... 
SK0902,388,If you'd like, please check on the others as well.
SK0902,389,Yeah, that's a great idea! I think everyone else is backstage or in the prop room.
SK0902,390,I-Is that so?
SK0902,391,Of course, Captain. Now, excuse us...
SK0902,392,Somehow I feel like I'm being driven out...
SK0902,393,Anyway, I guess I should go to another room.
SK0902,394,'Kay then, let's get back to work.
SK0902,395,...You're right.
SK0902,396,Captain, we still have some work to do, so... 
SK0902,397,If you'd like, please check on the others as well.
SK0902,398,Yeah, you're right. OK then, keep at it, you two.
SK0902,399,Thanks, Chief!
SK0902,400,Thank you for accompanying us too, Captain.
SK0902,401,Everyone has been working really hard for the Christmas performance.
SK0902,402,I should practice my ticket collecting...
SK0902,403,Maria... If we put that there, won't it make it harder for the audience to see?
SK0902,404,Hmm... It's a bit hard to say.
SK0902,405,...
SK0902,406,They're still working. I better not interrupt them.
SK0902,407,OK, let's check another room.
SK0902,408,The Christmas performance will be our final play for the year.
SK0902,409,The Miracle Bells, huh... I wonder what kind of play it will be.
SK0902,410,Arf, arf!
SK0902,411,His leash is a bit tilted.
SK0902,412,Hey, Shiro. You're still energetic, even in this cold weather.
SK0902,413,Hey, Hanamaru. You're still energetic, even in this cold weather.
SK0902,414,Hey, Dai. You're still energetic, even in this cold weather.
SK0902,415,Hey, Torte. You're still energetic, even in this cold weather.
SK0902,416,Hey, Long. You're still energetic, even in this cold weather.
SK0902,417,Hey, Altair. You're still energetic, even in this cold weather.
SK0902,418,Hey, Hund. You're still energetic, even in this cold weather.
SK0902,419,Arf!
SK0902,420,By the way, I heard that you're sleeping in front of the salon's fireplace at night.
SK0902,421,Woof.
SK0902,422,Hahaha. Well, aren't you a smart boy.
SK0902,423,Be careful not to catch cold.
SK0902,424,Arf, arf!
SK0902,425,Aw-wooo!
SK0902,426,His leash is a bit tilted.
SK0902,427,Shiro is working hard to dig a hole. Is he burying bones or something?
SK0902,428,Hanamaru is working hard to dig a hole. Is he burying bones or something?
SK0902,429,Dai is working hard to dig a hole. Is he burying bones or something?
SK0902,430,Torte is working hard to dig a hole. Is he burying bones or something?
SK0902,431,Long is working hard to dig a hole. Is he burying bones or something?
SK0902,432,Altair is working hard to dig a hole. Is he burying bones or something?
SK0902,433,Hund is working hard to dig a hole. Is he burying bones or something?
SK0902,434,...! Arf, arf, arf!
SK0902,435,Oh, you found me. I won't steal them. Don't worry.
SK0902,436,Arf, arf, arf!
SK0902,437,OK, OK. I'll stay away. Bye, Shiro.
SK0902,438,OK, OK. I'll stay away. Bye, Hanamaru.
SK0902,439,OK, OK. I'll stay away. Bye, Dai.
SK0902,440,OK, OK. I'll stay away. Bye, Torte.
SK0902,441,OK, OK. I'll stay away. Bye, Long.
SK0902,442,OK, OK. I'll stay away. Bye, Altair.
SK0902,443,OK, OK. I'll stay away. Bye, Hund.
SK0902,444,Ah! 4:45's passed already, where'd the time go?
SK0902,445,I forgot I had an appointment with Kaede!
SK0902,446,I gotta hurry to her room. I hope she'll forgive me for being a little late.
SK0902,447,Yo, Ogami.
SK0902,448,That voice... Kayama?
SK0902,449,Exactly! It's been a while, Ogami.
SK0902,450,Kayama... Can't you just come in through the entrance hall?
SK0902,451,Come on, come on. It's fine.
SK0902,452,Spending the end of the year with you just like this, how lucky I am.
SK0902,453,So many things have happened to us all, but I'd still call it a good year.
SK0902,454,I wonder what the next one will bring.
SK0902,455,There's a saying I know. "Don't look a gift horse in the mouth."
SK0902,456,Don't worry about what the future might bring. Living for the present is what's more important.
SK0902,457,You're right. Thanks, Kayama.
SK0902,458,Now that's the Ogami that I know.
SK0902,459,Later, Ogami. Adios.
SK0902,460,And... Merry Christmas.
SK0902,461,Christmas is still pretty far away, you know.
SK0902,462,Ugggh, so cold... Winter came so suddenly.
SK0902,463,We've only got a few weeks left before new year.
SK0902,464,It's empty. Nobody's here.
SK0902,465,Everyone said they were going to be around the stage.
SK0902,466,I hope these seats will be filled with guests when the Christmas performance comes.
SK0902,467,Well, it is a Flower Division performance. I think we'll be OK.
SK0902,468,I just talked with everyone in here earlier.
SK0902,469,I'm sure they're at the stage right now.
SK0902,470,No one's playing before the performance, just as I thought.
SK0902,471,I'm sure everyone's doing rehearsals on stage right now.
SK0902,472,Phew... Being in my own room is quite relaxing.
SK0902,473,Now, what should I do...
SK0902,474,Make a call.
SK0902,475,Maybe next time.
SK0902,476,I know, why don't I make a call?
SK0902,477,OK, who to call?
SK0902,478,Good afternoon. This is Capital News.
SK0902,479,On the previous coup incident, Tokyo was under the rebel force's control.
SK0902,480,The Imperial Assault Troupe was found battling with the Black Demon Society at Ginza and Shinjuku.
SK0902,481,Additionally, the Imperial Assault Troupe was seen piloting what appeared to be new spirit armor.
SK0902,482,It's possible that they have developed a new model for capital defense.
SK0902,483,Nippon Railway Co. has opened Yamanote Loop Line for business starting today.
SK0902,484,The new line connecting Kanda and Ueno has finished, which completes the full-circle railway.
SK0902,485,Passengers can now reach neighboring towns and villages efficiently without having to transfer trains. 
SK0902,486,The Cabinet has approved a new code bill for The Imperial Army in today's meeting.
SK0902,487,This bill is mainly supported by the conservative faction in the House of Peers.
SK0902,488,Meanwhile, due to the recent coup, many in the House of Representatives desire an even stricter bill.
SK0902,489,The Imperial Diet is likely to remain in turmoil for some time.
SK0902,490,Finally, it's time for this week's weather forecast.
SK0902,491,December's come and winter is about to arrive in Tokyo in full force.
SK0902,492,A harsh cold is being predicted to continue for some time.
SK0902,493,There are only a few weeks left in the year, and so we wish all our listeners a happy New Year.
SK0902,494,That's it for Capital News, brought to you by the Capital Daily Report.
SK0902,495,This concludes today's broadcast. We hope you will tune in for tomorrow's program.
SK0902,496,A red shadow opposes the evildoers lurking in the darkness of the capital. His name is Masked Red!
SK0902,497,Masked Red, the boy wonder of justice! Today he continues his fight for peace in the capital!
SK0902,498,Serial Radio Drama: Masked Red Special Episode - Masked Red's 7 Secrets, Last Chapter.
SK0902,499,Secret #5: What does Masked Red drive?
SK0902,500,His vehicle of choice is an all-purpose motorcycle called the Mach Red.
SK0902,501,Equipped with a special steam engine, it can go from Asakusa to Ginza in five minutes.

SK0902,507,He comes out of nowhere and leaves in the blink of an eye.

SK0902,509,It's his duty. Fight on, Masked Red! You're our hero, Masked Red!
SK0902,510,Well then, loyal followers, I hope we get the chance to meet again. Farewell.
SK0902,511,Go, Masked Red! Fight on, Masked Red! Till we meet again!
SK0902,512,Huh? Sounds like someone's coming.
SK0902,513,Yes? Who is it?
SK0902,514,Uhm... Ogami, is this a good time?
SK0902,515,Oh, Kasumi. Just a minute.
SK0902,516,Hi, Kasumi. Do you need something?
SK0902,517,Uhm... If you have the time, could you help me sort some paperwork?
SK0902,518,You can come to the secretarial office at 5 o'clock.
SK0902,519,Sorting paperwork, huh...
SK0902,520,I'm sure you're busy. If it turns out you don't have time, that's fine.
SK0902,521,Well, excuse me for now.
SK0902,522,5 o'clock at the secretarial office. What to do?
SK0902,523,Huh? Sounds like someone's coming.
SK0902,524,Who is it?
SK0902,525,It's Yuri. Ogami, can I ask for your help?
SK0902,526,Oh, Yuri. Just a minute?
SK0902,527,Yuri... What kind of help can I do?
SK0902,528,I need some help putting up posters at the VIP entrance around 5 o'clock.
SK0902,529,You can come if you have the time. It's all right if you're already too busy, though.
SK0902,530,(5 o'clock... Wasn't Kasumi asking for help at that time too?)
SK0902,531,I'll leave it up to you, OK? Just come by if you have the time!
SK0902,532,Ah, Yuri!
SK0902,533,Oh brother. Both want my help at 5 o'clock, talk about bad timing.
SK0902,534,Huh? Sounds like someone's coming.
SK0902,535,Yes?
SK0902,536,It's Tsubaki. Can I ask you something, Ogami?
SK0902,537,Now it's Tsubaki, huh?
SK0902,538,Hi, Tsubaki. By any chance, are you here to ask for my help?
SK0902,539,Eehh?! How did you know that, Ogami?
SK0902,540,I was planning to arrange some merchandise at 5 o'clock to prepare for the Christmas performance.
SK0902,541,I was going to ask if you wanted to help...
SK0902,542,(Of all the things, even Tsubaki wants me...)
SK0902,543,I'm sure you're busy. So if it turns out you don't have the time, that's perfectly fine!
SK0902,544,I'm going back to the gift shop now, so please excuse me!
SK0902,545,Aah, Tsubaki!
SK0902,546,Jeez, all three of them were asking for my help at the same time.
SK0902,547,I've got an appointment with Kaede too, let's just get there.
SK0902,548,Now... Where should I head next?
SK0902,549,Ah! 4:45's passed already, where'd the time go?
SK0902,550,I forgot I had an appointment with Kaede!
SK0902,551,I gotta hurry to her room. I hope she'll forgive me for being a little late.
SK0902,552,Let's do this later. I still have other stuff to do.
SK0902,553,I wonder if Kaede's in her room right now?
SK0902,554,Let's come back a little bit later.
SK0902,555,Ah, it's already time. I better hurry to Kaede's room...
SK0902,556,Oh, wait. I'm already here.
SK0902,557,I wonder what she's gonna talk about, anyway.
SK0902,558,Uh... It's Ogami.
SK0902,559,Oh, Ogami. You're rather early.
SK0902,560,I still haven't finished my tasks yet. Could you wait for me a little more?
SK0902,561,I see. Understood.
SK0902,562,Looks like I came a bit earlier than I was supposed to.
SK0902,563,I think I'll go somewhere else to kill some time.
SK0902,564,Nobody's here, huh? Well, it's not like many people usually come here anyway.
SK0902,565,There's nothing I can do in here, so I better get going.
SK0902,566,No one's in the library.
SK0902,567,Guess everyone's off to the stage... Nobody's around.
SK0902,568,I wonder if Reni's inside.
SK0902,569,She's not here... I guess she's at the stage.
SK0902,570,Reni... Still using notebook paper as a nameplate, I see.
SK0902,571,OK, let's check another room.
SK0902,572,I wonder if Sakura's inside.
SK0902,573,It's just like Sakura to have a cute nameplate like this.
SK0902,574,I better check another room, I guess.
SK0902,575,She's not here... I guess she's at the stage.
SK0902,576,I wonder if Kanna's inside.
SK0902,577,Kanna's nameplate... It looks more like a nametag to me.
SK0902,578,I better check another room, I guess.
SK0902,579,She's not here... I guess she's at the stage.
SK0902,580,I wonder if Orihime's inside.
SK0902,581,She's not here... I guess she's at the stage.
SK0902,582,The name plate has a simple design, but it sure looks classy.
SK0902,583,Let's go check another room.
SK0902,584,I wonder if Maria's inside.
SK0902,585,It's Maria's nameplate. It has simplistic design.
SK0902,586,I better check another room, I guess.
SK0902,587,She's not here... I guess she's at the stage.
SK0902,588,I wonder if Iris is inside.
SK0902,589,So Iris's nameplate is shaped like Jean-Paul.
SK0902,590,Guess I'll go somewhere else.
SK0902,591,She's not here... I guess she's at the stage.
SK0902,592,I wonder if Kohran's inside.
SK0902,593,A gear-shaped nameplate, huh? It's just Kohran's style.
SK0902,594,I better check another room, I guess.
SK0902,595,She's not here... I guess she's at the stage.
SK0902,596,I wonder if Sumire's inside.
SK0902,597,This is a pretty subtle design, considering it's Sumire.
SK0902,598,I better check another room, I guess.
SK0902,599,She's not here... I guess she's at the stage.
SK0902,600,Ah! 4:45's passed already, where'd the time go?
SK0902,601,I forgot I had an appointment with Kaede!
SK0902,602,I gotta hurry to her room. I hope she'll forgive me for being a little late.
SK0902,603,With the Black Demon Society gone, the Flower Division won't be deployed for a while.
SK0902,604,Seems that we can finish this year safe and sound. What a relief.
SK0902,605,This spirit radar was really useful when we were detecting the Pandemonium Regalia's whereabouts.
SK0902,606,The steam processor, being one of very few in Japan, is indeed awesome. We can always rely on it in times of trouble.
SK0902,607,Hmm... Guess no one's here.
SK0902,608,I probably shouldn't stick around here.
SK0902,609,I thought someone might be taking a bath right now, but I guess not.
SK0902,610,Oh well, I'll just go somewhere else.
SK0902,611,No one's in the dressing room. Looks like nobody's in the bathroom either.
SK0902,612,Well, I guess everyone must be at the stage now.
SK0902,613,This pool is still warm even during the winter. I can swim here year-round.
SK0902,614,I heard that it uses heat from an underground boiler.
SK0902,615,Looks like no one's in the training room.
SK0902,616,Guess everyone's off to the stage... Nobody's around.
SK0902,617,The wall that got blown up by the coup forces has already been repaired.
SK0902,618,I was surprised to see that the Rose Division was protecting the Regalia...
SK0902,619,Aaah, Ichiro! Welcome!
SK0902,620,We lost the Pandemonium Regalia, the items that we were supposed to protect...
SK0902,621,We decided to stay here and support you guys for a bit longer anyways!
SK0902,622,I'm so happy... I can still stay with you...
SK0902,623,R-Right...
SK0902,624,Anyway, there's one thing I'd like to ask you, Ensign Ogami...
SK0902,625,By any chance, do you have any regrets destroying the Pandemonium Regalia?
SK0902,626,I don't.
SK0902,627,A little bit...
SK0902,628,No, I don't.
SK0902,629,We can protect Tokyo with our own power, without relying on that thing.
SK0902,630,Even now, my mind hasn't changed.
SK0902,631,Wow! You're so cool, Ichiro!
SK0902,632,That's wonderful to hear, Ogami...
SK0902,633,We're relieved to hear that answer, Ensign Ogami...
SK0902,634,The truth is, I do regret it a bit.
SK0902,635,Did I get carried away and doom us all?
SK0902,636,No, I don't believe that to be the truth.
SK0902,637,The Pandemonium Regalia shouldn't exist... We all agreed on that.
SK0902,638,We believe that... you made the right decision...
SK0902,639,Uh... I don't really know.
SK0902,640,Ensign Ogami... Have some confidence in your actions.
SK0902,641,The Pandemonium Regalia shouldn't exist... We all agreed on that.
SK0902,642,We believe that... you made the right decision...
SK0902,643,To protect the capital with our own power...
SK0902,644,We were so preoccupied with the Regalia sitting so close to us, that we forgot what we should have been doing.
SK0902,645,Kotone...
SK0902,646,Our point is, we'll keep working together with you guys, for the sake of Tokyo!
SK0902,647,We'll always be in this room... So please visit us again.
SK0902,648,Please take care and see us, the Rose Division, the secret division of love and beauty, again!
SK0902,649,Uh-huh... OK.
SK0902,650,Oh boy... Looks like the Rose Division are going to be sticking around.
SK0902,651,Well, the more the merrier. I guess it'll be fine.
SK0902,652,Ah, Ichiro! You came back!
SK0902,653,W-Well... Somehow I ended up back here...
SK0902,654,To be honest with you, we can't return to the Imperial Army right now.
SK0902,655,The Army is still a mess after losing Kyogoku, right?
SK0902,656,And... we thought that our return would only make it worse, so...
SK0902,657,I-I see... I get what you mean.
SK0902,658,Which is why, we'll be in your care once again, Ensign Ogami.
SK0902,659,We wouldn't mind staying in the theater forever, if you're OK with it!
SK0902,660,Yokihiko... That's a wonderful idea!
SK0902,661,Uh... Uh-huh... Anyway, I need to get going.
SK0902,662,My, that's too bad. You could stay here for a while, you know.
SK0902,663,Don't hesitate to drop by this room anytime.
SK0902,664,Whew... Those guys are acting their usual selves.
SK0902,665,They're right, though. If they returned to the Army, it would just cause a big mess.
SK0902,666,The Flower Division's new spirit armors, the Tenbu...
SK0902,667,They're strengthening our strike capability, so that's pretty reassuring.
SK0902,668,Ah! 4:45's passed already, where'd the time go?
SK0902,669,I forgot I had an appointment with Kaede!
SK0902,670,I gotta hurry to her room. I hope she'll forgive me for being a little late.
SK0902,671,Uhm... Ogami...
SK0902,672,Hi, Kasumi. Do you need something?
SK0902,673,Uhm... If you have the time, could you help me sort some paperwork?
SK0902,674,You can come to the secretarial office at 5 o'clock.
SK0902,675,Sorting paperwork, huh...
SK0902,676,I'm sure you're busy. If it turns out you don't have time, that's fine.

SK0903,1,It's Ogami. Are you there, Kaede?
SK0903,2,Come in. The door's open.
SK0903,3,Kaede, what did you want to talk to me about?
SK0903,4,You know about the Flower Division's Christmas performance, right? "The Miracle Bells"?
SK0903,5,Yes. A special performance only held on Christmas Eve, correct?
SK0903,6,The thing is... The members need your help.
SK0903,7,They want you to pick who will play the main lead.
SK0903,8,What?! Me? Choose the star?
SK0903,9,We have four candidates for the main lead.
SK0903,10,Sakura...
SK0903,11,Sumire...
SK0903,12,Maria...
SK0903,13,Kanna...
SK0903,14,Iris...
SK0903,15,Kohran...
SK0903,16,Orihime...
SK0903,17,Reni...
SK0903,18,...Four of them.
SK0903,19,Will you do it, Ogami?
SK0903,20,Yes.
SK0903,21,I can't do it.
SK0903,22,Yes. I understand. I'll do my best.
SK0903,23,Well said, Ogami.
SK0903,24,I can't do it. I don't know anything about theater like that.
SK0903,25,It'll be fine.
SK0903,26,You just need to choose based on your true feelings. Everyone else said that, too.
SK0903,27,I see...
SK0903,28,...
SK0903,29,It's not an easy task to do, but... Would you help them, Ogami?
SK0903,30,The girls are putting the utmost trust in you.
SK0903,31,Any decision is fine. I hope you'll respond to their trust in your own way. 
SK0903,32,We'll give you until tomorrow to decide. Why don't you mull over it for today?
SK0903,33,...I understand.
SK0903,34,Do your best, Ogami. I'm counting on you.
SK0903,35,Choosing the main lead... Uh... I need to give it a lot of thought. It's a huge responsibility.
SK0903,36,Now it's... 5 o'clock, huh?
SK0903,37,Oh, right! I promised to help out now...
SK0903,38,Kasumi is sorting slips, Yuri is changing posters, Tsubaki is in the gift shop...
SK0903,39,Uh... Who do I pick?
SK0903,40,Go help Kasumi.
SK0903,41,Go help Yuri.
SK0903,42,Go help Tsubaki.
SK0903,43,OK, I'll go to the secretarial office to help Kasumi.
SK0903,44,OK, I'll go to the VIP entrance to help Yuri.
SK0903,45,OK, I'll go to the gift shop to help Tsubaki.
SK0903,46,Hi, Kasumi. I'm here to help.
SK0903,47,Ogami... Thank you very much.
SK0903,48,Well, let's get to sorting these slips right away.
SK0903,49,OK.
SK0903,50,Thanks for your work, Ogami. You were such a help.
SK0903,51,...
SK0903,52,Ogami?
SK0903,53,...Oh, sorry. I just have something on my mind.
SK0903,54,...
SK0903,55,Do you have some free time, Ogami?
SK0903,56,Yeah, I'm not busy.
SK0903,57,Let's go out for dinner, then. There's a restaurant called "Renga-Tei" and they have the most delicious foods.
SK0903,58,This is my way of thanking you for your help today, and I'm also curious about your problem.
SK0903,59,Huh? W-Wait...
SK0903,60,Please wait for a moment, I'll get changed.
SK0903,61,H-Hey, Kasumi!
SK0903,62,I see... Choosing the main lead is indeed a big responsibility.
SK0903,63,Sorry for talking about this, just after you invited me to this place.
SK0903,64,No, it's fine. You've always been a help to me.
SK0903,65,So I also want to lend you a hand at a time like this.
SK0903,66,So what's your biggest concern, Ogami?
SK0903,67,Well, you see...
SK0903,68,I don’t know who to choose.
SK0903,69,I worry about the others...
SK0903,70,Who should I choose? Who's fit for the role? I don't know...
SK0903,71,No wonder you're so worried about that. You've always been an earnest man.
SK0903,72,I'm worried about the other girls that aren't going to get the role. That's why I haven't been able to decide.
SK0903,73,I thought so... You're always such a kind person.
SK0903,74,I guess I'm mostly concerned as to why it's my decision. I don't get it.
SK0903,75,Well, it's no wonder you're so worried, you were told so suddenly.
SK0903,76,I think that you should choose the one person that you care about the most.
SK0903,77,I'm sure your feelings will get through to her. That's what makes for a good play.
SK0903,78,Kasumi...
SK0903,79,There'll be some disagreement no matter who you choose.
SK0903,80,But it won't be on you. Everyone trusts your decisions.
SK0903,81,You're right. If no one's picked to be the lead, then the play can't happen.
SK0903,82,Thanks for your advice, Kasumi.
SK0903,83,It was nothing. I'm just glad I could help.
SK0903,84,Well now, Ogami. I hope you can continue to keep me company for today.
SK0903,85,Let's enjoy what Renga-Tei has to offer now.
SK0903,86,Hi, Yuri. I'm here to help.
SK0903,87,Ah, Ogami! You really came. Thank you!
SK0903,88,OK, let's change the posters right away!
SK0903,89,OK.
SK0903,90,Thanks a lot, Ogami! You were such a help!
SK0903,91,...
SK0903,92,Ogami? Is something the matter?
SK0903,93,...Oh, sorry. I just have something on my mind.
SK0903,94,That's weird... You're not hiding something from me, are you?
SK0903,95,N-No... That's not...
SK0903,96,I know! How about you go out with me for a bit?
SK0903,97,Huh? Go where?
SK0903,98,There's this western-style restaurant called "Renga-Tei" that the others I often go to.
SK0903,99,This is my way of giving thanks, and I'm also curious about your little secret.
SK0903,100,Let's go, Ogami!
SK0903,101,Huh?! H-Hold on a minute, Yuri.
SK0903,102,Come on, it's fine. I'll change my clothes real quick, so wait a bit!
SK0903,103,H-Hey, Yuri!
SK0903,104,Uh-huh, I see. So you have to choose the lead actress.
SK0903,105,Yep, that's right. I've been thinking a lot about it
SK0903,106,Choosing the main character is indeed a big responsibility.
SK0903,107,So what is it that's been bothering you?
SK0903,108,Well, you see...
SK0903,109,I don’t know who to choose.
SK0903,110,I worry about the others...
SK0903,111,Who should I choose? Who's fit for the role? I don't know...
SK0903,112,You're being as indecisive as ever.
SK0903,113,I'm worried about the other girls that aren't going to get the role. That's why I haven't been able to decide.
SK0903,114,You're being too nice, you know?
SK0903,115,I guess I'm mostly concerned as to why it's my decision. I don't get it.
SK0903,116,You're being as carefree as ever.
SK0903,117,Just choose the girl you like the most, Ogami.
SK0903,118,If your feelings get through, I'm sure she'll do her best for the play!
SK0903,119,Hmm...
SK0903,120,Of course the others will feel a little sad not getting chosen...
SK0903,121,But if you keep on worrying about that, the play will never happen. After all, the show must go on!
SK0903,122,Right, I can't just keep worrying about this forever.
SK0903,123,Thanks for the advice, Yuri.
SK0903,124,You're welcome. I'm kind of glad I got to learn about some new stuff to talk about with the others.
SK0903,125,OK, now that we're here, let's enjoy our food, Ogami.
SK0903,126,Having a single date with you wouldn't hurt, right?
SK0903,127,Hi, Tsubaki. I'm here to help.
SK0903,128,Ah, Ogami! You really came. Thank you!
SK0903,129,OK, can you help me arrange the merchandise right now?
SK0903,130,OK.
SK0903,131,Thank you for helping me, Ogami! You were such a help!
SK0903,132,...
SK0903,133,Ogami? Is something wrong?
SK0903,134,...Oh, sorry. I just have something on my mind.
SK0903,135,...
SK0903,136,I know, Ogami! Can you go with me somewhere right now?
SK0903,137,Huh? Go where?
SK0903,138,To "Renga-Tei"! I've always wanted to go there with you.
SK0903,139,Their omelettes are really delicious! What do you say?
SK0903,140,Oh, OK...
SK0903,141,Ogami... There something bothering you, isn't there? Please, let me hear all about it.
SK0903,142,I'll go get changed. So wait a second!
SK0903,143,H-Hey, Tsubaki!
SK0903,144,I see... So you have to choose the main lead for the Christmas performance.
SK0903,145,Yeah, that's right.
SK0903,146,Wow! You're getting involved with the play. Isn't that a good thing?
SK0903,147,So what's bothering you?
SK0903,148,...
SK0903,149,I don’t know who to choose.
SK0903,150,I worry about the others...
SK0903,151,Who should I choose? Who's fit for the role? I don't know...
SK0903,152,I see... It IS really hard to decide.
SK0903,153,I'm worried about the other girls that aren't going to get the role. That's why I haven't been able to decide.
SK0903,154,You're right... The ones who weren't picked might feel sad...
SK0903,155,I guess I'm mostly concerned as to why it's my decision. I don't get it.
SK0903,156,I feel like... I get what you're getting at...
SK0903,157,...
SK0903,158,It may sound cheeky for me to say this...
SK0903,159,But I think that you should just choose the girl you like the most.
SK0903,160,I'm sure the Flower Division members will feel the same way too.
SK0903,161,Hmm...
SK0903,162,You're always worried about everyone, Ogami. Have some faith in yourself.
SK0903,163,Right, I can't just keep worrying about this forever.
SK0903,164,Thanks for your advice, Tsubaki.
SK0903,165,Excuse me for sounding pretentious...
SK0903,166,Tee-hee! Well, Ogami, let's eat!
SK0903,167,I've always wanted to bring you here, even if it was just once! My dream has finally come true!

SK0904,1,Right, I should get started on my night watch.
SK0904,2,It's cold out tonight, but I've got a job to do.
SK0904,3,(I should check everyone's rooms first.)
SK0904,4,(I wonder if Iris is asleep already?)
SK0904,5,Who is it?
SK0904,6,It's Ogami. Were you still up, Iris?
SK0904,7,Mon Frère... I can't sleep. Can you come in?
SK0904,8,I see... All right, I'll come in for a second.
SK0904,9,What's the matter, Iris? Why the long face?
SK0904,10,Well... Jean-Paul and I have been talking.
SK0904,11,We were wondering if I can even play the lead at all, since I'm so little...
SK0904,12,...
SK0904,13,*sigh* I wish I could grow up already...
SK0904,14,I'm no good for the lead right now.
SK0904,15,That's not true.
SK0904,16,Maybe that's a good thing.
SK0904,17,True, it might be a bit much.
SK0904,18,That's not true at all, Iris.
SK0904,19,There's nothing that says a child can't play the role of an adult.
SK0904,20,I know you'd give a pure, innocent performance.
SK0904,21,...You really think so, Mon Frère?
SK0904,22,I'm no playwright, so I can't say much, but that's what I really think.
SK0904,23,Mon Frère...
SK0904,24,Thank you, Mon Frère. Now I feel like I can do it!
SK0904,25,No matter what role I wind up with, I'll do my very best!
SK0904,26,Good. Break a leg, Iris.
SK0904,27,All right, I have to get back to my night watch. Good night, Iris.
SK0904,28,Good niiiight!
SK0904,29,Maybe that's actually a good thing.
SK0904,30,...Huh?
SK0904,31,Someone as small as you playing the role of an adult might be interesting, no?
SK0904,32,Besides, I know you'd give a pure, innocent performance.
SK0904,33,...You really think so, Mon Frère?
SK0904,34,I'm no playwright, so I can't say much, but that's what I really think.
SK0904,35,Mon Frère...
SK0904,36,Thank you, Mon Frère. Now I feel like I can do it!
SK0904,37,No matter what role I wind up with, I'll do my very best!
SK0904,38,Good. Break a leg, Iris.
SK0904,39,All right, I have to get back to my night watch. Good night, Iris.
SK0904,40,Good niiiight!
SK0904,41,True... This might be a bit too much for you.
SK0904,42,You think so too, huh?
SK0904,43,Everyone was telling me I could do it too...
SK0904,44,But it's still too hard for me.
SK0904,45,...I'm sorry, Mon Frère. I'm interrupting your night watch.
SK0904,46,No, it's all right, Iris.
SK0904,47,I might not be good enough now, but I'll keep on practicing...
SK0904,48,And when I grow up, I'll do my best to get the lead role!
SK0904,49,I see... That's great, Iris.
SK0904,50,All right, I have to get back to my night watch. Good night, Iris.
SK0904,51,OK. Good night, Mon Frère.
SK0904,52,Sorry, Iris. As the person picking the lead, there's nothing I can tell you.
SK0904,53,Ah, that's right... Sorry, Mon Frère.
SK0904,54,I'm sorry I couldn't be of any help...
SK0904,55,It's OK. I'll be fine.
SK0904,56,Just talking to you cheered me up a little.
SK0904,57,I see...
SK0904,58,All right, I should get back to my night watch. Good night, Iris.
SK0904,59,OK. Good night, Mon Frère.
SK0904,60,Nothing unusual in the salon.
SK0904,61,I should take a peek in the game room while I'm at it.
SK0904,62,...
SK0904,63,Oh, if it isn't Sumire.
SK0904,64,...! E-Ensign?!
SK0904,65,What are you doing in a place like this?
SK0904,66,W-Well... I was just listening to a record.
SK0904,67,I was thinking of how I'm going to portray the lead role while I was listening to it.
SK0904,68,I see... That sounds about right for you, Sumire.
SK0904,69,...
SK0904,70,...
SK0904,71,Sumire... Aren't you going to listen to it?
SK0904,72,Ah... Y-Yes, that's right.
SK0904,73,...
SK0904,74,Sumire?
SK0904,75,Ensign... Could I ask you something?
SK0904,76,What is it?
SK0904,77,Am I... going to play the lead in "The Miracle Bells"?
SK0904,78,That's the plan.
SK0904,79,I'm still thinking it over.
SK0904,80,...I can't say.
SK0904,81,I...
SK0904,82,Ah! Wait!
SK0904,83,Don't tell me after all, not right now...
SK0904,84,Sumire...
SK0904,85,I... I'd love to play the lead...
SK0904,86,But I don't think I'm ready to.
SK0904,87,I'm... scared to hear your answer.
SK0904,88,Sumire...
SK0904,89,I think I'll be ready to hear it tomorrow.
SK0904,90,Well then, I'll be taking my leave.
SK0904,91,Good night, Sumire.
SK0904,92,Good night, Ensign. Good luck with your night watch.
SK0904,93,...
SK0904,94,Right, back to my night watch.
SK0904,95,I'm still thinking it over.
SK0904,96,I see...
SK0904,97,You're really thinking hard about this, aren't you, Ensign.
SK0904,98,If you're putting this much thought into it...
SK0904,99,Then I know it'll be a wonderful play.
SK0904,100,...
SK0904,101,I'm looking forward to your answer tomorrow.
SK0904,102,Thanks, Sumire.
SK0904,103,Of course, I can promise you that I'll put on the greatest show you've ever seen if you pick me.
SK0904,104,Well then, I'll be taking my leave. Good night, Ensign.
SK0904,105,All right, good night, Sumire.
SK0904,106,Right, back to my night watch.
SK0904,107,I can't tell you, not until tomorrow.
SK0904,108,Y-You're right. What's gotten into me?
SK0904,109,I'll just have to look forward to your answer tomorrow.
SK0904,110,Well then, I'll be taking my leave. Good night, Ensign.
SK0904,111,All right, good night, Sumire.
SK0904,112,I promise you, Ensign, that I'll put on the greatest show you've ever seen if you pick me.
SK0904,113,Sumire...
SK0904,114,Sorry, Sumire. As the person picking the lead, there's nothing I can tell you.
SK0904,115,Y-You're right. What's gotten into me?
SK0904,116,I shall wait until tomorrow, with my heart pounding all the while.
SK0904,117,Well then, I'll be taking my leave. Good night, Ensign.
SK0904,118,All right, good night, Sumire.
SK0904,119,I promise you, Ensign, that I'll put on the greatest show you've ever seen if you pick me.
SK0904,120,Sumire...
SK0904,121,Nothing unusual in the hall...
SK0904,122,Oh, right, I should check the terrace, too.
SK0904,123,Oh... Captain.
SK0904,124,Maria? What are you doing here?
SK0904,125,Apologies, sir. I was reading this script and got caught up in it.
SK0904,126,I completely lost track of what time it was.
SK0904,127,Hahaha, how passionate of you.
SK0904,128,So much has happened this past year...
SK0904,129,This will be the final performance to cap the year off.
SK0904,130,...
SK0904,131,A special performance where I get to spend Christmas Eve with you...
SK0904,132,I want to make this play a success... No matter what.
SK0904,133,Maria...
SK0904,134,It's all right, it's going to be a success.
SK0904,135,This is a big responsibility for me, huh?
SK0904,136,You should get some sleep.
SK0904,137,It's all right, Maria. It's going to be a success. I know the audience will recognize your feelings.
SK0904,138,Sir... Thank you.
SK0904,139,Now come on, you'll catch a cold if you stay out here. Let's get back inside.
SK0904,140,Yes, sir.
SK0904,141,Let's make the Christmas play a hit, Captain.
SK0904,142,Yeah. Let's do this, Maria.
SK0904,143,Yes, sir.
SK0904,144,This is a big responsibility for me, huh? I have to pick who's going to lead in such an important play...
SK0904,145,It'll be all right, Captain. Everyone in the Flower Division has their own unique skills and character.
SK0904,146,They'll all put on a wonderful performance that I'm sure will meet your expectations.
SK0904,147,All that will be left is for you to give them a little push.
SK0904,148,...
SK0904,149,All right then, sir, I'll be heading back to my room.
SK0904,150,OK. Good night, Maria.
SK0904,151,Good night, Captain. Good luck with your night watch.
SK0904,152,OK, let's continue with the night watch.
SK0904,153,I know exactly how you feel, Maria, but you should call it a night.
SK0904,154,Besides, it's freezing out here, you should head back inside.
SK0904,155,Yes, you're exactly right. Let's get back inside.
SK0904,156,All right then, sir, I'll be heading back to my room.
SK0904,157,OK. Good night, Maria.
SK0904,158,Good night, Captain. Good luck with your night watch.
SK0904,159,OK, let's continue with the night watch.
SK0904,160,I'm being allowed to help out with the play this time.
SK0904,161,So I want this to be a success just as much as you do, Maria.
SK0904,162,Right. Do your best, sir.
SK0904,163,Yeah. Thanks, Maria.
SK0904,164,All right then, sir, I'll be heading back to my room.
SK0904,165,OK. Good night, Maria.
SK0904,166,Good night, Captain. Good luck with your night watch.
SK0904,167,OK, let's continue with the night watch.
SK0904,168,OK, where to next?
SK0904,169,Hm? Seems like someone's out in the yard.
SK0904,170,...
SK0904,171,Is that you, Reni? What are you doing standing around in a place like this?
SK0904,172,Captain?
SK0904,173,I just felt like moving around all of a sudden... So I came here.
SK0904,174,Captain... If you don't mind, could you watch me dance?
SK0904,175,Sure, no problem.
SK0904,176,Watch you... dance?
SK0904,177,I'm in the middle of my night watch...
SK0904,178,Sure, no problem.
SK0904,179,Thank you. All right... Here I go.
SK0904,180,Hah!
SK0904,181,(Whoa...)
SK0904,182,(Reni's always so quiet, I never imagined she could dance with such passion.)
SK0904,183,Did you know... There's a god of the stage?
SK0904,184,...A god?
SK0904,185,That's right. Whenever an actor surpasses a certain level with their dance or performance...
SK0904,186,The god smiles as he watches them perform.
SK0904,187,So I'm going to give "The Miracle Bells" all I've got... So that the god may smile upon us.
SK0904,188,I want to make this play a success... No matter what.
SK0904,189,Reni...
SK0904,190,Sorry, Captain. I know you're in the middle of your night watch.
SK0904,191,No, it's fine. Don't worry about it.
SK0904,192,Thanks. All right, I'm going back to my room.
SK0904,193,I see. Good night, Reni.
SK0904,194,Good night, Captain.
SK0904,195,Well... I ought to get going, too.
SK0904,196,Watch you... dance?
SK0904,197,When I was in the Star Division, I learned ballet.
SK0904,198,I see... I had no idea.
SK0904,199,Well then... Here I go.
SK0904,200,Hah!
SK0904,201,(Whoa...)
SK0904,202,(Reni's always so quiet, I never imagined she could dance with such passion.)
SK0904,203,Did you know... There's a god of the stage?
SK0904,204,...A god?
SK0904,205,That's right. Whenever an actor surpasses a certain level with their dance or performance...
SK0904,206,The god smiles as he watches them perform.
SK0904,207,So I'm going to give "The Miracle Bells" all I've got... So that the god may smile upon us.
SK0904,208,I want to make this play a success... No matter what.
SK0904,209,Reni...
SK0904,210,Sorry, Captain. I know you're in the middle of your night watch.
SK0904,211,No, it's fine. Don't worry about it.
SK0904,212,Thanks. All right, I'm going back to my room.
SK0904,213,I see. Good night, Reni.
SK0904,214,Good night, Captain.
SK0904,215,Well... I ought to get going, too.
SK0904,216,I appreciate the offer, but I'm in the middle of my night watch.
SK0904,217,I see... Sorry.
SK0904,218,All right, I'm going to go. Try not to stay up too late, OK, Reni?
SK0904,219,Yes, understood.
SK0904,220,Sorry, Reni. As the person picking the lead, I can't watch only you dance.
SK0904,221,I see... Sorry.
SK0904,222,All right, I'm going to go. Try not to stay up too late, OK, Reni?
SK0904,223,Yes, understood.
SK0904,224,OK... Time to start patrolling underground.
SK0904,225,Hm? Is that you, Kanna?
SK0904,226,Oh, Boss?
SK0904,227,I was just readin' the lines for the Holy Mother... This is tough.
SK0904,228,I've played almost nothing but masculine roles like King Lear or Son Goku up till now.
SK0904,229,Do you really think I have what it takes to play a feminine role like this?
SK0904,230,Of course you do!
SK0904,231,Well, who knows?
SK0904,232,True, that might be tough.
SK0904,233,Of course you do! You'd be great, Kanna.
SK0904,234,Huh? R-really?
SK0904,235,Yeah, really. Don't think about it so hard.
SK0904,236,Just throw yourself into it like you always do, Kanna.
SK0904,237,Boss...
SK0904,238,Thanks, Boss. I'm feelin' a bit more confident now.
SK0904,239,It's true, there's some performances only I can do in the Flower Division.
SK0904,240,I just gotta do things my own way. Maybe a boyish heroine wouldn't be so bad.
SK0904,241,Heheh, now I'm lookin' forward to how this play turns out, too.
SK0904,242,Kanna...
SK0904,243,Thanks, Boss! Whether I get the lead or not, I think I can put in a good performance.
SK0904,244,All right, time for me to hit the hay already. Night, Boss!
SK0904,245,Yeah, good night.
SK0904,246,Well... I ought to get going, too.
SK0904,247,Well, who knows? Nobody knows how things will turn out.
SK0904,248,But no matter what role you wind up with, so long as you give it your all, I know it'll turn out great.
SK0904,249,Boss...
SK0904,250,You're right. Worrying's not gonna get me anywhere.
SK0904,251,I'll do my best, in my own way.
SK0904,252,Heheh, they might even like that the lead's more boyish than they expected.
SK0904,253,Kanna...
SK0904,254,Thanks, Boss! Whether I get the lead or not, I think I can put in a good performance.
SK0904,255,All right, time for me to hit the hay already. Night, Boss!
SK0904,256,Yeah, good night.
SK0904,257,Well... I ought to get going, too.
SK0904,258,True, that might be tough.
SK0904,259,You think so too, huh, Boss?
SK0904,260,This is way too big of a role for me...
SK0904,261,Well, whether I get the lead or not, I'll give it all I've got.
SK0904,262,I see...
SK0904,263,Oh, whoops, would ya look at the time.
SK0904,264,All right, time for me to hit the hay already. Night, Boss!
SK0904,265,Yeah, good night.
SK0904,266,Well... I ought to get going, too.
SK0904,267,Sorry, Kanna. As the person picking the lead, there's nothing I can tell you.
SK0904,268,Ah... You're right.
SK0904,269,My bad, I was talkin' nonsense.
SK0904,270,All right, time for me to hit the hay already. Night, Boss!
SK0904,271,Yeah, good night.
SK0904,272,Well... I ought to get going, too.
SK0904,273,Now then, up next is the music room.
SK0904,274,Hm? Orihime, is that you?
SK0904,275,That voice...
SK0904,276,Ensign. On your night watch, are you?
SK0904,277,Were you playing the piano just now?
SK0904,278,Yes... That's what I came here to do...
SK0904,279,But whenever I think about playing it... I just can't do it.
SK0904,280,Huh?
SK0904,281,To play the piano, you need not only your fingers, but your heart, too.
SK0904,282,Usually I just move my fingers without having to think...
SK0904,283,Maybe it's because I don't have a good mental image for the lead role of "The Miracle Bells"...
SK0904,284,Orihime...
SK0904,285,Believe in yourself, Orihime.
SK0904,286,It happens.
SK0904,287,You should get to bed.
SK0904,288,Believe in yourself, Orihime. Tell yourself you can do it.
SK0904,289,Try to remember the usual Orihime, overflowing with confidence.
SK0904,290,Ensign...
SK0904,291,...
SK0904,292,...! I did it!
SK0904,293,See, Orihime? You were able to play the piano just now.
SK0904,294,Ensign... Thank you.
SK0904,295,You don't have to worry about me anymore, Ensign.
SK0904,296,I'm back to my normal self! Overflowing with confidence!
SK0904,297,Hahaha... Glad to hear it.
SK0904,298,I've got the perfect mental image of the lead role for the Christmas play.
SK0904,299,You can relax, Ensign, the play's in buone mani!
SK0904,300,(...Buone mani? Does she mean to say the play's in good hands?)
SK0904,301,It happens. Don't rush things, just wait it out.
SK0904,302,You'll be able to play again before long.
SK0904,303,...Really?
SK0904,304,You're always so full of confidence, so you might not have a lot of experience with this...
SK0904,305,But everyone has their off days, you know?
SK0904,306,...
SK0904,307,All right, you should probably head to bed for today.
SK0904,308,Understood. All right, Ensign, good night.
SK0904,309,Yeah, good night.
SK0904,310,Right, I should get going too.
SK0904,311,You must be tired. You should go to bed for today.
SK0904,312,...
SK0904,313,C'mon, Orihime...
SK0904,314,It's frustrating, but I'll go back to my room.
SK0904,315,All right then, Ensign, good night.
SK0904,316,Yeah, good night.
SK0904,317,Right, I should get going too.
SK0904,318,Sorry, Orihime. As the person picking the lead, there's nothing I can tell you.
SK0904,319,...Oh, that's right.
SK0904,320,I don't see the harm in talking about something like this, though.
SK0904,321,All right, Ensign, I'll be going back to my room. Good night.
SK0904,322,Yeah, good night.
SK0904,323,Right, I should get going too.
SK0904,324,Let's see... Let's check backstage.
SK0904,325,Oh... Kohran?
SK0904,326,Ah, Chief!
SK0904,327,Couldn't sleep?
SK0904,328,Y-Yeah...
SK0904,329,I was just thinkin' about the Christmas play...
SK0904,330,Chief... What do you think will happen if I'm the star?
SK0904,331,You can't tell when it's all tied up in braids, but my hair's actually super frizzy.
SK0904,332,On top of that, I can't see a thing without my glasses, so I gotta wear them on stage.
SK0904,333,The Holy Mother, wearing glasses... That'd just be weird, huh?
SK0904,334,Of course not.
SK0904,335,That might actually make it better.
SK0904,336,You might be right.
SK0904,337,Of course not. You're worrying too much.
SK0904,338,Your glasses, your hair, that's not what matters.
SK0904,339,It's the emotion of the performer that matters most, isn't it?
SK0904,340,Chief...
SK0904,341,Talking with you has made me feel a bit more confident somehow...
SK0904,342,I'm gonna try my best.
SK0904,343,I'm gonna get up on that stage with all the emotion I've got!
SK0904,344,Kohran...
SK0904,345,All right then, I'll head back to my room.
SK0904,346,Thanks a bunch, Chief. I mean it. Good luck with your night watch!
SK0904,347,Kohran...
SK0904,348,Actually... That might make it even better.
SK0904,349,A heroine wearing glasses? That's fresh and new!
SK0904,350,Y-Ya think so...?
SK0904,351,Sure I do! Have a little faith in yourself, Kohran.
SK0904,352,Your cheerfulness is the best thing about you. Bring that with you up on stage!
SK0904,353,Chief...
SK0904,354,All right, Chief, I'll do it!
SK0904,355,Whether I get the lead or not, I'm gonna be so cheerful up there!
SK0904,356,I'll show everyone in the audience my good side!
SK0904,357,Kohran...
SK0904,358,I think I feel all better now.
SK0904,359,All right, I'm gonna head back to my room. Good luck with your night watch!
SK0904,360,Sure, good night.
SK0904,361,Good night, Chief... And thanks a lot... I mean it.
SK0904,362,Kohran...
SK0904,363,Hmm... You might be right.
SK0904,364,You think so too, huh, Chief?
SK0904,365,I knew it, I can't do it with these glasses of mine...
SK0904,366,Kohran...
SK0904,367,...It's OK, Chief.
SK0904,368,I'll do my best up there, in my own way!
SK0904,369,I think my upbeat personality's my strong point.
SK0904,370,So whether I get the lead role or not, I'm gonna give it my all!
SK0904,371,I see...
SK0904,372,All right then, I'll head back to my room.
SK0904,373,Thanks a bunch, Chief. I mean it. Good luck with your night watch!
SK0904,374,Kohran...
SK0904,375,Sorry, Kohran. I've been worrying about who to pick, myself.
SK0904,376,I can't be having this discussion with you if I'm going to remain impartial.
SK0904,377,Ah... R-Right!
SK0904,378,You're totally right. Sorry 'bout that.
SK0904,379,All right, Chief, I'm gonna head back to my room.
SK0904,380,Sure. Good night, Kohran.
SK0904,381,Night, Chief. Good luck with your night watch.
SK0904,382,Well... I ought to get going, too.
SK0904,383,OK, last up, time to check the stage.
SK0904,384,Hm? Sounds like someone's here.
SK0904,385,Spin to the right... Put your foot out...
SK0904,386,(It's Sakura. Is she practicing some kind of dance?)
SK0904,387,...Who is it?
SK0904,388,(...! She spotted me?!)
SK0904,389,Ogami...
SK0904,390,Sorry, Sakura. Didn't mean to interrupt your dance practice.
SK0904,391,No, it's all right. I was thinking about wrapping up anyway.
SK0904,392,I see...
SK0904,393,Were you practicing for the upcoming play?
SK0904,394,N-No, that was just a dance I learned a long time ago.
SK0904,395,Whenever I feel like I'm about to lose track of my current role or the play...
SK0904,396,I always repeat that dance.
SK0904,397,Sakura...
SK0904,398,You've got this, Sakura.
SK0904,399,The fundamentals are important.
SK0904,400,You should get to bed.
SK0904,401,You've got this, Sakura.
SK0904,402,Thank you. I'll do my best.
SK0904,403,I'll go back to basics, start fresh and do my utmost best.
SK0904,404,That way I won't regret not having given it everything I got.
SK0904,405,Sakura...
SK0904,406,All right, Ogami, I'll be going back to my room. Good work on your night watch.
SK0904,407,Yeah, thanks. Good night, Sakura.
SK0904,408,Of course. Good night, Ogami.
SK0904,409,OK, it's about time I wrapped up my night watch. I should head back to my room, too.
SK0904,410,The fundamentals are important. Sometimes you just have to go back to basics.
SK0904,411,Yes, that's true.
SK0904,412,I remember the first time I danced... How nervous I felt, how much fun I had...
SK0904,413,And I remember how I felt going up on stage for the very first time...
SK0904,414,I feel like it all came back to me just now.
SK0904,415,Sakura...
SK0904,416,All right, Ogami, I'll be going back to my room. Good work on your night watch.
SK0904,417,Yeah, thanks. Good night, Sakura.
SK0904,418,Of course. Good night, Ogami.
SK0904,419,OK, it's about time I wrapped up my night watch. I should head back to my room, too.
SK0904,420,Don't overdo it, it's bad for your health. You should get to bed.
SK0904,421,...OK. Understood.
SK0904,422,Good work on your night watch, Ogami. Good night.
SK0904,423,Yeah, good night, Sakura.
SK0904,424,OK, it's about time I wrapped up my night watch. I should head back to my room, too.
SK0904,425,Sorry, Sakura. As the person picking the lead, there's nothing I can tell you.
SK0904,426,Ah... S-Sorry, I said some weird things, didn't I?
SK0904,427,Don't worry about what I said just now.
SK0904,428,All right, Ogami, I'll be going back to my room. Good work on your night watch.
SK0904,429,Yeah, thanks. Good night, Sakura.
SK0904,430,Of course. Good night, Ogami.
SK0904,431,OK, it's about time I wrapped up my night watch. I should head back to my room, too.
SK0904,432,Phew, finally done with my night watch.
SK0904,433,Still, everyone's doing their best for this Christmas play.
SK0904,434,Just who should I pick...?
SK0904,435,Sorry, Ogami, but each customer is only allowed to purchase one photo at a time.
SK0904,436,I see. That's too bad.
SK0904,437,Sorry, Ogami, but each customer is only allowed to purchase one photo at a time.
SK0904,438,Oh, really? That's too bad.

SK0905,14,(Should I pick Sakura?)

SK0905,46,The one I've picked for the lead role... is Sakura.
SK0905,47,...!
SK0905,48,Ogami... Are you... Are you really sure?
SK0905,49,Yes. Please, Sakura.
SK0905,50,...OK!
SK0905,51,The one I've picked for the lead role... is Sumire.
SK0905,52,Ensign... I knew you'd pick me!
SK0905,53,Yes. Please, Sumire.
SK0905,54,...OK!
SK0905,55,The one I've picked for the lead role... is Maria.
SK0905,56,Captain... Are you really sure?
SK0905,57,Yes. Please, Maria.
SK0905,58,...Yes, sir! I'll do my best to live up to your expectations!
SK0905,59,The one I've picked for the lead role... is Kanna.
SK0905,60,Whaaa?! Boss... Me? Are you sure?
SK0905,61,Yes. Please, Kanna.
SK0905,62,All right, you got it! I'll give it everything I've got for you, Boss!
SK0905,63,The one I've picked for the lead role... is Iris.
SK0905,64,Really, Mon Frère? Are you sure?
SK0905,65,Yes. Please, Iris.
SK0905,66,OK! I'll do it! I'll do my best!
SK0905,67,The one I've picked for the lead role... is Kohran.
SK0905,68,Ch-Chief... For real? Me? Are you sure?
SK0905,69,Yes. Please, Kohran.
SK0905,70,...OK! Thanks a bunch, Chief! I'm gonna give it my all!
SK0905,71,The one I've picked for the lead role... is Orihime.
SK0905,72,Ensign... I knew you'd pick me!
SK0905,73,Yes. Please, Orihime.
SK0905,74,Just leave it to me! I'll make this the best play ever!
SK0905,75,The one I've picked for the lead role... is Reni.
SK0905,76,Captain... Are you... sure?
SK0905,77,Yes. Please, Reni.
SK0905,78,...OK, understood.
SK0905,79,Ogami always makes the right choice. I'm positive this will be a wonderful play.
SK0905,80,Well, I suppose I can let someone else be the star this time.
SK0905,81,We're all in this together. Let's make this a great Christmas play.
SK0905,82,You got this! We'll light up the stage!
SK0905,83,I'll do my best too as one of the angels!
SK0905,84,This play's gonna be great! I can't wait!
SK0905,85,Don't let your guard down, or I'll snatch the lead role away from you!
SK0905,86,It's all right. The god of the stage is with is.
SK0905,87,The lead isn't alone. The entire Flower Division together is the true star.
SK0905,88,Everyone... Let's make this a Christmas play to remember!
SK0905,89,Sir, yes, sir!
SK0905,90,And so, rehearsals for "The Miracle Bells" began.
SK0905,91,After having picked the lead, I was put in charge of the entire production.
SK0905,92,Ogami, what mood should we aim for with our set design?
SK0905,93,Let's see...
SK0905,94,Let's go for a cheery mood.
SK0905,95,Let's go for a solemn mood.
SK0905,96,Let's go for an ominous mood.
SK0905,97,Let's go for a cheery mood befitting of Christmas.
SK0905,98,OK, got it. We'll go for a cheery, flashy feel.
SK0905,99,All right, leave it to me! I'll set up the lights so the stage is positively radiant!
SK0905,100,It is a play about the miracle on Christmas, so let's go for a more solemn mood.
SK0905,101,I see... An angelic feel fitting for the holy night.
SK0905,102,All right, leave it to me! I'll build us a nice, solemn set!
SK0905,103,Rather, what if we went with an ominous mood?
SK0905,104,Huh?! Did... Did you say "ominous"?
SK0905,105,Ahahaha! Why not, Sakura? That could be interesting!
SK0905,106,Besides, this is Chief's play this time around, it's all up to him!
SK0905,107,All right, I'll go fix up the lights to give the stage an ominous feel.
SK0905,108,Ensign, what kind of play is this going to be?
SK0905,109,Hmm...
SK0905,110,Let's make it emotional.
SK0905,111,Let's make it action-packed.
SK0905,112,Let's make it comedic.
SK0905,113,We should make it emotional and stir up the crowd.
SK0905,114,That's an excellent idea. We'll put on a show that'll warm the hearts of the entire audience.
SK0905,115,OK, let's make the necessary rewrites, then.
SK0905,116,What if we went all-out and made it action-packed?
SK0905,117,That's a great idea! Nothing beats action when it comes to plays!
SK0905,118,All right, then let's rewrite the script right away, then.
SK0905,119,What if we made it an audacious comedy?
SK0905,120,Sounds like fun! Let's close out the old year and ring in the new with some laughter!
SK0905,121,Hmm... This will require a major rewrite to the script...
SK0905,122,So what, Maria? Let's make it fun and have ourselves a blast!
SK0905,123,...Understood. Let's go with a comedic version of "The Miracle Bells."
SK0905,124,And with that, the course of the play is more or less set.
SK0905,125,All right, let's start our rehearsals over, from the top!
SK0905,126,Day in, day out, the Flower Division passionately continued their rehearsals.
SK0905,127,The direction started to take shape, and the play finally started moving along.
SK0905,128,And now, at last, it's time to direct all the performers.
SK0905,129,In "The Miracle Bells, the seven people aside from the heroine will portray angels.
SK0905,130,Hey, Mon Frère. About the angel roles...
SK0905,131,What kind of performance should we be giving?
SK0905,132,Captain, about the angel roles...
SK0905,133,What kind of performance should we be giving?
SK0905,134,Act in total sync with each other.
SK0905,135,Act as restrained as possible.
SK0905,136,Everyone can act as they please.
SK0905,137,What if you all acted in sync with each other, in total unison?
SK0905,138,I think it would look very pretty to have all seven of you lined up and performing together.
SK0905,139,OK, got it! We'll all dance in a neat line!
SK0905,140,Roger. We'll act in total sync.
SK0905,141,Do you think you could act as restrained as possible, so that the heroine stands out more?
SK0905,142,That's kinda boring, but if that's what you want, then OK.
SK0905,143,Roger. As restrained as possible.
SK0905,144,I'll leave it up to you, everyone can act as they please.
SK0905,145,OK, got it! Eheheh, I hope I do well!
SK0905,146,...Roger. We'll leave it to everyone's own judgment.
SK0905,147,Then finally... The direction of
SK0905,148,the heroine's performance.
SK0905,149,Ogami... Opening day is finally approaching.
SK0905,150,Give me your final direction for my performance.
SK0905,151,Act purely.
SK0905,152,Act cheerily.
SK0905,153,Act gracefully.
SK0905,154,Let's go for a pure feel. I think it suits you perfectly.
SK0905,155,Ogami... Thank you.
SK0905,156,I'll do my best to give a pure-hearted performance!
SK0905,157,Sakura...
SK0905,158,Let's go for a bright, cheery feel. I think it suits you perfectly.
SK0905,159,Ogami... Thank you.
SK0905,160,I'll do my best to give a bright, cheery performance!
SK0905,161,Sakura...
SK0905,162,Let's go for a graceful, refined feel. I know you can do it, Sakura.
SK0905,163,Graceful, huh? Heehee, you're making me blush.
SK0905,164,It's thanks to you we've made it this far.
SK0905,165,Thank you, Ogami... I mean it.
SK0905,166,Sakura...
SK0905,167,We'll make this play amazing, for your sake, too!
SK0905,168,Ensign... Opening day is finally approaching.
SK0905,169,Please give me your final direction for my performance.
SK0905,170,Act purely.
SK0905,171,Act cheerily.
SK0905,172,Act gracefully.
SK0905,173,Let's go for a pure feel. I think it suits you perfectly.
SK0905,174,Ensign... Thank you.
SK0905,175,I'll put on a marvelous performance, so as to not betray your expectations.
SK0905,176,All right. I can't wait.
SK0905,177,Let's go for a bright, cheery feel. I think it suits you perfectly.
SK0905,178,...Oh dear. I don't think that would let my particular qualities shine through.
SK0905,179,But I think it'd be quite interesting to have a cheerful, lively Holy Mother.
SK0905,180,Well if you insist, then it looks like I don't have a choice. Very well.
SK0905,181,I'm looking forward to it, Sumire.
SK0905,182,Let's go for a graceful, refined feel. I know you can do it, Sumire.
SK0905,183,Of course, just leave it to me!
SK0905,184,When it comes to grace, nobody comes close to Sumire Kanzaki!
SK0905,185,Hahaha... You're so reliable.
SK0905,186,It's all thanks to you that we've made it as far as we have.
SK0905,187,Ensign... Truly, you have my thanks.
SK0905,188,Sumire...
SK0905,189,We'll make this a wonderful play, for your sake, too!
SK0905,190,Captain... Opening day is finally approaching.
SK0905,191,Please give me your final direction for my performance.
SK0905,192,Act purely.
SK0905,193,Act cheerily.
SK0905,194,Act gracefully.
SK0905,195,Let's go for a pure feel. I think it suits your dignified image perfectly.
SK0905,196,Dignified, huh...? Understood.
SK0905,197,I'm looking forward to it, Maria.
SK0905,198,How about we try a bright, cheerful performance, just this once.
SK0905,199,Cheerful... you say? I don't know...

SK0907,60,At any rate, that was an excellent play. I bet it'd even be a success in Italy.
SK0907,61,Hahaha... Glad to hear it.
SK0907,62,Captain...
SK0907,63,Hey, Reni. Great job today. That was a wonderful show.
SK0907,64,All that preparation, all that passion, all the affection from the crowd...
SK0907,65,And that brief moment where the god of the stage smiled upon us. It was a miraculous play.
SK0907,66,I want to keep performing plays like that forever.
SK0907,67,Reni...
SK0907,68,Oh, so that's where you two ran off to.
SK0907,69,Ah... Mr. Yoneda?
SK0907,70,What have we here, a Christmas date? Hahaha... Ah, youth is a wonderful thing.
SK0907,71,Well, today's a special day. Just make sure you two get back by midnight.
SK0907,72,Mr. Yoneda...
SK0907,73,If it's all right with you Ogami, maybe we could... Step outside for a moment?
SK0907,74,I'd like to take a walk through the capital on Christmas with you.
SK0907,75,All right, sure. It's a Christmas Eve date, then... Until midnight, anyway.
SK0907,76,O-OK!
SK0907,77,Wow... It's snowing!
SK0907,78,You're right. It's piled up quite a bit, too.
SK0907,79,It almost feels like I'm dreaming...
SK0907,80,Like we're still in the middle of the play.
SK0907,81,To think I get to spend Christmas all alone with you...
SK0907,82,Sakura...
SK0907,83,Let's have our one magical hour until midnight, OK, Ogami?
SK0907,84,Seeing as it's Christmas and all, I'd like to visit that chapel over there.
SK0907,85,All right, sure. Let's go.
SK0907,86,I've always wanted to visit a chapel on Christmas.
SK0907,87,It's so quiet. Doesn't sound like anybody's inside.
SK0907,88,Why don't we step in for a bit, Ogami?
SK0907,89,All right, sure, let's drop in.
SK0907,90,Makes sense to visit a church on Christmas, since it's a Western holiday.
SK0907,91,Yes. Christmas is a day full of love.
SK0907,92,And it's a day where we pray to express our gratitude.
SK0907,93,What I'm grateful for is... Your love, Ogami...
SK0907,94,Ah... S-Sorry, I don't know what came over me...
SK0907,95,Sakura...
SK0907,96,Ogami... I...
SK0907,97,...
SK0907,98,Kiss her.
SK0907,99,Sakura...
SK0907,100,Yes...
SK0907,101,Ah!
SK0907,102,I-Is that the bell?
SK0907,103,Ah!
SK0907,104,I-Is that the bell?
SK0907,105,It's 12 o'clock. The magic hour is just about over, huh.
SK0907,106,The magic hour, huh?
SK0907,107,We have to get back to the theater.
SK0907,108,Sakura...
SK0907,109,Ogami...
SK0907,110,Please... Stay with me forever.
SK0907,111,...
SK0907,112,All right. I'll stay by your side. Forever.
SK0907,113,...OK.
SK0907,114,If it's all right with you, Ensign, perhaps we could step outside for a moment?
SK0907,115,I'd like to take a stroll with you through the capital while it's still Christmas. Just the two of us.
SK0907,116,All right, sure. It's a Christmas Eve date, then... Until midnight, anyway.
SK0907,117,Well then, shall we, Sumire?
SK0907,118,Yes.
SK0907,119,My, it's snowing. It feels so good after being on that hot stage.
SK0907,120,You're right. It's piled up quite a bit, too.
SK0907,121,Snowfall on Christmas...
SK0907,122,It's almost as though the snow itself is blessing us.
SK0907,123,The snow's blessing us, huh?
SK0907,124,So much has happened this past year.
SK0907,125,I only barely managed to avoid getting married...
SK0907,126,Yeah, that did happen, huh...
SK0907,127,Back then... I was prepared for the possibility that I'd never step foot in the Imperial Theater ever again.
SK0907,128,That I'd never get to see you again, Ensign...
SK0907,129,But instead, I was able to go on stage as the star of the Christmas play.
SK0907,130,Being with you like this, just the two of us...
SK0907,131,It's quite mysterious, when you think about it.
SK0907,132,Yeah, it is.
SK0907,133,No, it isn't.
SK0907,134,You're right, it's so mysterious.
SK0907,135,I wonder if God is just teasing us...
SK0907,136,No, it's not mysterious at all.
SK0907,137,It's because we followed our hearts that we're both here now.
SK0907,138,It's because we both worked so hard that the snow's blessing us like this.
SK0907,139,Ensign...
SK0907,140,...
SK0907,141,That reminds me, there's a chapel down the way here, isn't there?
SK0907,142,Would you like to stop by, Ensign?
SK0907,143,Yeah, sure. Let's go.
SK0907,144,You're right. I had no idea there was a chapel here.
SK0907,145,Let's go inside, Ensign.
SK0907,146,I was hoping to express my thanks to God for something.
SK0907,147,Oh? Thanks for what?
SK0907,148,Well, you see...
SK0907,149,I wanted to properly express my gratitude that we could be together like this...
SK0907,150,That I could be with you for Christmas.
SK0907,151,Sumire...
SK0907,152,Ensign...
SK0907,153,Captain... There's a chapel a small distance from here.
SK0907,154,If it's all right with you, sir, do you think we could go there together?
SK0907,155,All right, sure. It's a Christmas Eve date, then... Until midnight, anyway.
SK0907,156,Right, then. Let's go, Maria.
SK0907,157,Yes, sir.
SK0907,158,Ah... Captain, look. Snow.
SK0907,159,You're right. It's piled up quite a bit, too.
SK0907,160,I guess snow's not exactly an uncommon occurrence for you, since you were born in Russia.
SK0907,161,Yes. The winters in Russia are long and intense.
SK0907,162,Which is why we have to cherish whatever human contact and warmth we can get.
SK0907,163,We brave the winter, hand in hand...
SK0907,164,And a joyous spring greets us at the end.
SK0907,165,Maria...
SK0907,166,Let's go, Captain.
SK0907,167,You can't have Christmas without going to church at some point.
SK0907,168,Going to church for Christmas, huh? I see.
SK0907,169,Captain, let's offer a prayer.
SK0907,170,Sure...
SK0907,171,What's the right way for me to pray, Maria?
SK0907,172,You don't have to worry about your form, sir.
SK0907,173,It's not how you pray that matters, but rather what you feel.
SK0907,174,(How I feel, huh?)
SK0907,175,(What should I pray for?)
SK0907,176,Give thanks for everything.
SK0907,177,Pray for future happiness.
SK0907,178,(I wish to express my gratitude... For having met everyone in the Imperial Assault Troupe...)
SK0907,179,(And for having met Maria... Thank you.)
SK0907,180,(May everyone in the Imperial Assault Troupe... And Maria...)
SK0907,181,(Live happy, enjoyable lives.)
SK0907,182,...
SK0907,183,All right, Captain, let's go.
SK0907,184,What did you pray for, Maria?
SK0907,185,I gave my thanks for the joy of being alive.
SK0907,186,The joy of... being alive?
SK0907,187,Life is full of pain and sadness.
SK0907,188,Sometimes, you get separated from the people most important to you, forever.
SK0907,189,...
SK0907,190,But... I try to cherish the joy of ever having known them.
SK0907,191,It's because I'm alive that I get to meet so many people.
SK0907,192,I wanted to express my gratitude for that, and my hope that I may continue to live with the others.
SK0907,193,That's what I prayed for.
SK0907,194,Maria...
SK0907,195,Captain, I hope that... For as long as I live...
SK0907,196,For as long as you live... What?
SK0907,197,...No, it's nothing.
SK0907,198,Now then, it's almost midnight. We should head back.
SK0907,199,Wh-What's with you, Maria? You're worrying me...
SK0907,200,Come on now, quit loafing around, or I'm leaving you behind.
SK0907,201,Hey, Boss? Um... If it's cool with you... Wanna head outside?
SK0907,202,There's some stuff I wanna talk to you about, alone.
SK0907,203,All right, sure. It's a Christmas Eve date, then... Until midnight, anyway.
SK0907,204,All right then, let's go, Kanna.
SK0907,205,Yeah! Thanks, Boss.
SK0907,206,Ah! Boss, look, it's snowing!
SK0907,207,You're right. When did all this snow pile up, anyway?
SK0907,208,Ahahaha! Snow! Snow! It's snowing, Boss!
SK0907,209,Right, you're from Okinawa, so you don't get to see snow very often, huh?
SK0907,210,That's right. I can count on one hand the amount of times I've seen snow.
SK0907,211,You think maybe it's snowing cause I played the lead tonight? Ahahahaha!
SK0907,212,If that's the case, and we feel like having a snowball fight or something...
SK0907,213,I guess that'd mean it was worth giving you the lead role after all.
SK0907,214,...Now you've done it, Boss. How's about we get this snowball fight underway already?!
SK0907,215,Uh oh, better get outta here before she beats me up!
SK0907,216,Heheh, I'm not lettin' you get away that easily! Wait up, Boss! Hahahaha!
SK0907,217,Oh... I never knew there was a church arond here.
SK0907,218,Why don't we step inside, since it's Christmas and all. Might be fun.
SK0907,219,It's quiet. Doesn't sound like anyone's in there.
SK0907,220,We can't make too much noise in a church...
SK0907,221,But still, it's Christmas, we should be celebrating! I almost feel like dancing!
SK0907,222,Typical Kanna...
SK0907,223,...
SK0907,224,Boss... Can I... ask you a question?
SK0907,225,Sure, what is it?
SK0907,226,Why did you pick me for the lead?
SK0907,227,Well, you see...
SK0907,228,You were the best fit.
SK0907,229,I thought it'd be funny.
SK0907,230,I thought you were the best fit out of everyone.
SK0907,231,Thanks, Boss... I'm glad to hear you say that.
SK0907,232,I thought it'd be funny to see you play the lead.
SK0907,233,Psh, I thought as much.
SK0907,234,No particular reason. I picked you cause I wanted to.
SK0907,235,I see. Well, it certainly wasn't boring.
SK0907,236,To be totally honest... I was kinda nervous at first.
SK0907,237,Like, "Can someone like me even play this role?"
SK0907,238,But since you picked me, I decided to trust you.
SK0907,239,And since you picked me, I decided to believe in myself.
SK0907,240,Kanna...
SK0907,241,All right, Boss, let's get outta here.
SK0907,242,Yahoo!
SK0907,243,Hahaha... You're full of energy tonight.
SK0907,244,Yeah! I'm in a great mood right now!
SK0907,245,You picked me for the lead...
SK0907,246,We made made the audience super happy...
SK0907,247,I've never felt this happy before in my life!
SK0907,248,Thank you, Boss. I mean it, thanks!
SK0907,249,Kanna...
SK0907,250,Uh oh, it's gonna be past midnight soon!
SK0907,251,OK, race you to the theater, then!
SK0907,252,All right, you're on! Think you can beat me, Boss? Hahahaha!
SK0907,253,What do you think we should do, Iris?
SK0907,254,Ah! Look outside, Mon Frère! It's snowing!
SK0907,255,C'mon, let's go outside! Can we, Mon Frère?
SK0907,256,Hahaha, you're right. Sure, let's go.
SK0907,257,Yaaaay! C'mon, let's go, Mon Frère!
SK0907,258,Look, Mon Frère! It's snowing so much!
SK0907,259,You're right. When did all this snow pile up, anyway?
SK0907,260,Heheh! I'll make you a snowman!
SK0907,261,Thanks, Iris. Aren't your hands a little cold, though?
SK0907,262,I'll be OK! Just wait a little bit longer.
SK0907,263,...All done! Here you go, Mon Frère.
SK0907,264,Thanks, Iris. What a cute snowman.
SK0907,265,Heheh! I'll make you an even bigger one tomorrow!
SK0907,266,I know! There's a church a little further down the road.
SK0907,267,C'mon, let's go! We can make it back before midnight.
SK0907,268,Yeah, sure, let's take a look.
SK0907,269,You're right. I never knew there was a church here.
SK0907,270,Let's go inside, Mon Frère! C'mon, hurry!
SK0907,271,Hahaha, you're energetic tonight, Iris.
SK0907,272,It's quiet. Doesn't sound like anyone's inside.
SK0907,273,I'll pray to be a good girl.
SK0907,274,You already are a good girl, Iris.
SK0907,275,Heheh, thank you, Mon Frère. I'll pray for you, then.
SK0907,276,...
SK0907,277,...? What's wrong, Iris?
SK0907,278,I'm still just a kid. I'm not a grown up like the others.
SK0907,279,I can't be your girlfriend...
SK0907,280,And I was too small to play the lead role after all.
SK0907,281,Iris...
SK0907,282,That's not true.
SK0907,283,That might be true.
SK0907,284,Iris... That's not true.
SK0907,285,That might be true, in a sense.
SK0907,286,Mon Frère...
SK0907,287,But that's why I picked you for the lead, Iris.
SK0907,288,You're not wrong, Iris, but you're not right, either.
SK0907,289,Huh? What do you mean, Mon Frère?
SK0907,290,Your positivity, your innocence, your honesty...
SK0907,291,Those are your strong points. Your age doesn't matter.
SK0907,292,That's why I thought you'd be able to convey the purity of the lead role.
SK0907,293,Mon Frère...
SK0907,294,You understand now, Iris?
SK0907,295,Uh-huh! Thanks, Mon Frère!
SK0907,296,I love you!
SK0907,297,I hope I can be with you forever!
SK0907,298,Hahaha, yeah.
SK0907,299,I know! I've got a great idea!
SK0907,300,Since we're in a church, let's get married, right now!
SK0907,301,Huh?! M-Married?!
SK0907,302,I'm... I'm glad you feel that way, Iris, but you're still a little young...
SK0907,303,Huh?! But you just said my age doesn't matter!
SK0907,304,Th-That was for something completely different!
SK0907,305,Marry me, Mon Frère!
SK0907,306,Ah... It's almost midnight, Iris. I'm going back to the theater.
SK0907,307,Ah, he's getting away! Wait, Mon Frèèère!
SK0907,308,Chief... Um... Wanna head outside for a bit?
SK0907,309,There's some stuff I wanted to talk to you about, now that the play's over.
SK0907,310,All right, sure. It's a Christmas Eve date, then... Until midnight, anyway.
SK0907,311,OK, let's go, Kohran.
SK0907,312,For real? Thanks a bunch, Chief. All right, let's go.
SK0907,313,Wow... Look, Chief, snow.
SK0907,314,You're right. When did all this snow pile up, anyway?
SK0907,315,It's so pretty...
SK0907,316,Yeah. It's a White Christmas.
SK0907,317,...
SK0907,318,...Kohran? What's up?
SK0907,319,Spending Christmas alone with you, Chief...
SK0907,320,This is all too good for me.
SK0907,321,Kohran...
SK0907,322,Call it a date if you want, but I can't help but feel I don't meet the bar.
SK0907,323,I know I'm not drop-dead gorgeous like the other girls in the Flower Division...
SK0907,324,That's not true.
SK0907,325,So what if you aren't?
SK0907,326,Kohran... That's not true.
SK0907,327,I'm happy to be with you. I mean it.
SK0907,328,Chief...
SK0907,329,So what if you aren't?
SK0907,330,I like you just the way you are, Kohran.
SK0907,331,Chief...
SK0907,332,Don't worry about all that, Kohran.
SK0907,333,You're you. You don't have to overextend yourself.
SK0907,334,The crowd loved having a lead with glasses, didn't they?
SK0907,335,It's your natural genuineness that I like so much about you.
SK0907,336,Chief...
SK0907,337,You're right. I'm me. No need to overextend myself.
SK0907,338,Being together with you like this...
SK0907,339,I'm allowed to be happy about it in my own way.
SK0907,340,That's right. It's that unique Kohran-ness that makes you special.
SK0907,341,Yeah! Thanks, Chief!
SK0907,342,All right, let's get goin'! How about we wander around the capital till midnight?
SK0907,343,Sounds good! Let's do that.
SK0907,344,Ah, Chief! Look over there, a chapel!
SK0907,345,You're right... I had no idea there was a chapel around here.
SK0907,346,Looks like fun. Why don't we step inside for a sec?
SK0907,347,Sure, let's go in.
SK0907,348,It's quiet... Doesn't sound like anyone else is here.
SK0907,349,Getting to hear the Christmas bells together with you like this...
SK0907,350,This might be the greatest Christmas I've ever had in my life...
SK0907,351,Kohran...
SK0907,352,Oh yeah, I totally forgot something important, Chief!
SK0907,353,I invented something special to celebrate Christmas with, just for such an occasion!
SK0907,354,Oh? What is it?
SK0907,355,A special firework capable of 16 consecutive bursts! I call it "Mr. Firecracker"!
SK0907,356,M-Mr. Firecracker?!
SK0907,357,All right, here we go! Ready?
SK0907,358,I... knew... this would... happen...
SK0907,359,S-Sorry 'bout that, Chief... Don't have a clue why it blew up like that.
SK0907,360,Hahaha... I'm used to your explosions at this point.
SK0907,361,Like I said before, it's that unique Kohran-ness of yours that makes you special.
SK0907,362,Ahahaha! Was that supposed to be a compliment? Eh, I'll take it!
SK0907,363,Once again, Chief... Merry Christmas.
SK0907,364,Yeah. Merry Christmas, Kohran.
SK0907,365,Why don't we take the opportunity to go outside, Ensign?
SK0907,366,I've been hoping to spend Christmas Eve with you for a long time.
SK0907,367,All right, sure. It's a Christmas Eve date, then... Until midnight, anyway.
SK0907,368,Now that that's decided, let's not waste any time! Come on, hurry!
SK0907,369,H-Hey, you don't have to pull so hard.
SK0907,370,Wow... Look, Ensign, snow!
SK0907,371,You're right. When did all this snow pile up, anyway?
SK0907,372,It's snowing right on Christmas... What good timing! Ottimo tempismo!
SK0907,373,The snow must be giving us its blessing!
SK0907,374,Hahaha, you might be right.
SK0907,375,At any rate, the city lights look so pretty with all this snow.
SK0907,376,When I first came to Japan, Sakura told me something.
SK0907,377,She said that she wanted to be like these city lights, and shine up on stage.
SK0907,378,She wanted to be like a strong, warm light, guiding people's way and protecting the peace.
SK0907,379,At the time, I thought the lights in this city were insignificant.
SK0907,380,But now... I know exactly what she meant.
SK0907,381,I want to keep on shining, with you and everyone else in the Flower Division.
SK0907,382,Orihime...
SK0907,383,We'll be together forever.
SK0907,384,You sure have changed.
SK0907,385,Orihime... We'll be together forever.
SK0907,386,Ensign...
SK0907,387,Boy, Orihime, you sure have changed.
SK0907,388,Sh-Shut up!
SK0907,389,Keep talking like that and I'm leaving you here!
SK0907,390,Hahaha, kidding, kidding.
SK0907,391,But there is one big difference between Sakura and I.
SK0907,392,And what's that?
SK0907,393,That I'm the brightest light there is, of course!
SK0907,394,Hahaha, there's the Orihime I know.
SK0907,395,Heehee! Come on, Ensign, let's get going.
SK0907,396,Oh, I had no idea there was a chapel around here.
SK0907,397,What a pretty Christmas tree...
SK0907,398,Ah, one of the stars fell off!
SK0907,399,Ensign, help me put this star back!
SK0907,400,All right, leave it to me!
SK0907,401,Careful, Orihime...
SK0907,402,Thanks, Ensign. I'll be all right.
SK0907,403,All right, you, back with the rest of your little star friends...
SK0907,404,We should go, Ensign. Let's get back to the others.
SK0907,405,You're right, it's almost midnight.
SK0907,406,Ensign...
SK0907,407,What is it?
SK0907,408,One last time... Merry Christmas.
SK0907,409,Yeah. Merry Christmas.
SK0907,410,What should we do, Reni?
SK0907,411,I'd... like to go outside for a while.
SK0907,412,I'm still not used to so much noise. I'd like to go somewhere quiet.
SK0907,413,I see. All right, let's go have a walk outside, then.
SK0907,414,...OK.
SK0907,415,Ah... Snow.
SK0907,416,You're right. When did all this snow pile up, anyway?
SK0907,417,That reminds me, Reni, it was your birthday today, right? How old are you now?
SK0907,418,I'm 16.
SK0907,419,I see. Well, once again, Happy Birthday.
SK0907,420,I always thought birthdays were nothing more than a reference point for measuring one's growth.
SK0907,421,I thought there was no point in celebrating the day you were born.
SK0907,422,But now... Things are different. It's because I was born that I was able to meet you all.
SK0907,423,Birthdays let me know that I'm not alone.
SK0907,424,Reni...
SK0907,425,Oh, I had no idea there was a chapel around here.
SK0907,426,Why don't we offer a prayer while we're here?
SK0907,427,But... I've never prayed before.
SK0907,428,Don't worry, it's nothing to stress over. Come on, let's go inside.
SK0907,429,What should I do, Captain?
SK0907,430,Just think really hard about what you feel in your heart.
SK0907,431,Like what?
SK0907,432,Like what? Well...
SK0907,433,How about making a wish?
SK0907,434,How about giving thanks?
SK0907,435,How about making a wish? Think really hard about your hopes so that they might come true.
SK0907,436,...OK, I get it.
SK0907,437,In that case... I'd like to stay at the theater with everyone forever.
SK0907,438,With you... forever.
SK0907,439,Reni...
SK0907,440,How about giving thanks for something that made you happy?
SK0907,441,Got it. I'll give it a try.
SK0907,442,I'm glad to have met everyone at the theater.
SK0907,443,I'm glad to have met the Captain. Thank you.
SK0907,444,Reni...
SK0907,445,Was that good enough, sir?
SK0907,446,Yeah. That was great, Reni.
SK0907,447,Oh, it's almost midnight.
SK0907,448,Let's go home, Reni. To the theater, where everyone's waiting for us.
SK0907,449,...OK.
SK0907,450,Sorry, Ogami, but each customer is only allowed to purchase one photo at a time.
SK0907,451,I see. That's too bad.

SK1001,7,Likewise.
SK1001,8,Oh Reni, you haven't changed since last year!
SK1001,9,Come on, it's fine! A gentle girl is way better than a noisy one!
SK1001,10,Hearing it from you doesn't seem to convincing at all, Kanna.
SK1001,11,Come on, you two. Are you starting a fight as the new year just begun?
SK1001,12,Ahahaha... Everyone's still the same.
SK1001,13,Let's have a rice cake pounding contest with my invention, "Mr. Pounder"!

SK1002,3,Mine is to be more grown-up!
SK1002,4,Is that even a resolution?

SK1002,6,My resolution is...
SK1002,7,Strive for peace.
SK1002,8,Getting along with members.
SK1002,9,Having a fun life.
SK1002,10,My resolution for this year is to ensure peace for this city.

SK1002,12,My resolution for this year is to get along with the all our members.

SK1002,14,My resolution for this year is to have a life well lived.
SK1002,15,My... What a resolution that is.
SK1002,16,It does seem fun to have a life like that. You certainly 
SK1002,17,But as the captain, why don't you think of a more positive resolution?
SK1002,18,R-Right...
SK1002,19,...I haven't give much thougt on it.
SK1002,20,Oh, is that so?
SK1002,21,Since it's the beginning of a new year, you should think about some goals that you want to achieve.
SK1002,22,Hmm... OK, I'll give it some thought.
SK1002,23,You seem to have one, Sakura. Tell us.
SK1002,24,My resolution this year is to polish my swordmanship.
SK1002,25,I'm trying to learn my father's stance so I can get as skilled as he was.
SK1002,26,To do that this year, I intend to practice a lot. Starting from the basics and other techniques.
SK1002,27,I get it... That's a nice resolution.
SK1002,28,For that reason, I want to return home to Sendai for a bit.
SK1002,29,I see... What about the others? Do you have plans for New Year?
SK1002,30,I plan to return to the Kanzaki mansion as well.
SK1002,31,I wanna go back to Okinawa to visit my dad's grave.
SK1002,32,Is that so... How about you, Maria?
SK1002,33,I'm planning to visit Count Hanakoji's residence for New Year's. I owe him a lot.
SK1002,34,I'm planning to go to Kobe. I'm visiting my old foster father.
SK1002,35,I see...
SK1002,36,Mon Frère, Mon Frère, you gotta hear this!
SK1002,37,My papa and mama are coming all the way from France to see me!
SK1002,38,Is that so? That's great.
SK1002,39,Yeah! I'll be with my papa and mama for a while!
SK1002,40,My mamma will also visit Japan to see my father.
SK1002,41,Really? Reuniting after all this time, isn't that great?
SK1002,42,Yes! Fantastico!
SK1002,43,By the way, what's you plan, Ogami?
SK1002,44,I'll be staying here.
SK1002,45,I want to go out.
SK1002,46,Lazing in bed.
SK1002,47,I'll be staying here.
SK1002,48,Even though we took down the Black Demon Society, leaving the theater alone worries me.
SK1002,49,Haha, aren't you being ever so diligent?
SK1002,50,Let's see... I also want to go somewhere.
SK1002,51,Ah, you're free to leave if you'd like.
SK1002,52,This is one of the few days we can have off during the year, so no need to worry about anything else.
SK1002,53,I'll just lazing around in bed for New Year's.
SK1002,54,Oh, you're going to loung around. Well, I suppose that's not a bad choice.
SK1002,55,I haven't decided yet.
SK1002,56,Aha, I see that you haven't worried too much about anything. That's very like you.
SK1002,57,Now, everyone. I hope you'll get to relax for the New Year.

SK1003,7,By any chance... Would you like to come with me?
SK1003,8,Huh?!
SK1003,9,You see, I'd like to introduce you to my mother... If that's all right.

SK1003,16,Th-This is so sudden. I'm not sure I'm mentally prepared...
SK1003,17,It's all right, Ogami. It's not that formal of an invitation.
SK1003,18,If you'd like, you can think of it as a nice, short trip.

SK1003,20,Going to meet your mother... It's almost like we're engaged.
SK1003,21,Oh, n-no... I didn't mean it that way.
SK1003,22,I only wanted to show you the town I grew up in.

SK1003,30,OK then... I'll be waiting in my room.
SK1003,31,Whenever you're ready, please come let me know.
SK1003,32,So I'm going to Sendai with Sakura... Looks like I just got a bit busier all of a sudden.
SK1003,33,In any case, I don't think I should show up to her parents' home in this outfit...
SK1003,34,I'll head back to my room and change into something else, then meet Sakura at her room.
SK1003,35,Ensign, do you have a moment?
SK1003,36,Hm?
SK1003,37,Hey Sumire. What is it?
SK1003,38,As I mentioned not long ago, I plan to return to the Kanzaki estate over the New Years' holiday.
SK1003,39,That said... I would like to extend a special invitation for you to accompany me.
SK1003,40,If you'll have me, I'd love to.
SK1003,41,Are you sure you want me along?
SK1003,42,I'd love to. Ever since the marriage arrangement business, I've wanted a chance to sit down and talk with your family.
SK1003,43,Is that so? It would be just lovely to have you there for the new year.
SK1003,44,Are you sure you want me along?
SK1003,45,I made a real mess of your marriage arrangement a while back...
SK1003,46,Worry not, Ensign. This time, you will be coming on my invitation.
SK1003,47,Should anyone have an issue, you can respond with your head held high.
SK1003,48,I see... In that case, maybe I'll take the plunge and accept your invitation.
SK1003,49,Good, I am pleased to hear it.
SK1003,50,Hmm, what to do...
SK1003,51,Ensign... If you are holding back due to the business with the marriage arrangement, there's truly no need.
SK1003,52,You would be coming along on my invitation, and thus an honored guest.
SK1003,53,We could pass through the gates of the Kanzaki estate together, with your head held high.
SK1003,54,I see... In that case, maybe I'll take the plunge and accept your invitation.
SK1003,55,Good, I am pleased to hear it.
SK1003,56,Very well, I shall await you in my room.
SK1003,57,Once your preparations are complete, do come and see me there.
SK1003,58,So I'm going to Sumire's family estate... I'd better look respectable when I get there.
SK1003,59,I'll head back to my room and change into something else, then meet Sumire at her room.
SK1003,60,A moment please, Captain?
SK1003,61,Hm?
SK1003,62,Hey Maria. What do you need?
SK1003,63,How would you feel about visiting Count Hanakoji with me?
SK1003,64,I'm sure the count would be pleased if you were to come along with me.
SK1003,65,All right, let's go.
SK1003,66,What a pain...
SK1003,67,All right, let's go. I'd be happy to come along.
SK1003,68,Really? I'd appreciate it.
SK1003,69,Hmm, for New Years'? That may be a hassle...
SK1003,70,You know Captain... I can understand wanting to relax over the New Years' holiday.
SK1003,71,But the count is a very busy man. If we don't take the opportunity now, it could be a while before we get another.
SK1003,72,I-I understand. OK, I'll go with you.
SK1003,73,I appreciate it, Captain.
SK1003,74,Hmm, what to do...
SK1003,75,...You know, the atmosphere in the city around New Years' isn't too bad.
SK1003,76,So why waste the opportunity? Don't stay cooped up in the theater, come out with me.
SK1003,77,You've got a point, there. OK, let's go.
SK1003,78,You'll come, then? I appreciate it.
SK1003,79,I will be waiting in my own room.
SK1003,80,Once you're ready to leave, come and get me.
SK1003,81,I'd better look my best if I'm going to see Count Hanakoji.
SK1003,82,I'll head back to my room and change into something else, then meet Maria at her room.
SK1003,83,Yo Boss, hang on for a sec.
SK1003,84,Hm?
SK1003,85,Hey, Kanna. Need something?
SK1003,86,Erm... Y'know how I said before that I'm goin' home to Okinawa?
SK1003,87,Any chance you'd wanna tag along?
SK1003,88,Wait, to Okinawa?
SK1003,89,Yeah. How's that sound?
SK1003,90,If you'll have me, I'd love to.
SK1003,91,Just how would we get there?
SK1003,92,If you'll have me, I'd love to. Spending New Years' in Okinawa doesn't sound too bad.
SK1003,93,Heheh, you know it! Winter in Okinawa is always niiice and warm!
SK1003,94,Okinawa, huh?... Just how would we get there?
SK1003,95,By boat. A nice leisurely boat trip sounds pretty good, eh?
SK1003,96,Though I guess the boat might capsize if the sea's too rough.
SK1003,97,Huh?! What would we do THEN?
SK1003,98,In that case, it'd be time to go for a swim! Ahahaha!
SK1003,99,(...Are we really gonna get there in one piece?)
SK1003,100,Hmm, what to do...
SK1003,101,Listen, you'll fall out of shape if ya stay all cooped up indoors the whole vacation!
SK1003,102,Winter in Okinawa's always relaxing 'cause of how warm it is. C'mon Boss, come with me!
SK1003,103,...Yeah, all right. I'll give this a shot and go with you.
SK1003,104,Heheh, now that's the spirit!
SK1003,105,All right, come an' get me when you're ready to hit the road.
SK1003,106,I'll be in my room. See ya soon!
SK1003,107,So I'm going to Okinawa with Kanna... If I recall, she said she wanted to visit her old man's grave, too.
SK1003,108,I'd better get dressed properly for the occasion.
SK1003,109,OK, I'll head back to my room and change clothes, then meet up with Kanna in her room.
SK1003,110,Mon Frère!!
SK1003,111,Hm?
SK1003,112,Hey, Iris. Did you need something?
SK1003,113,Hey Mon Frere, are you doing anything for New Years'?
SK1003,114,Oh... No, not particularly.
SK1003,115,Then why don't you come home with me to meet my papa and mama?
SK1003,116,Wait, me?!
SK1003,117,Yep! They both said they wanted to meet you!
SK1003,118,What do you think, Mon Frere?
SK1003,119,If you'll have me, I'd love to.
SK1003,120,I'm not sure I'm mentally prepared...
SK1003,121,Yeah, sure. I'd be glad to.
SK1003,122,Really? Yay! Yay!
SK1003,123,I can't believe you, me, papa, and mama are all gonna be together for New Years'!
SK1003,124,Hahaha, seeing you so excited brings a smile to my face, too.
SK1003,125,Th-This is so sudden. I'm not sure I'm mentally prepared...
SK1003,126,Aww... Are you nervous about meeting them?
SK1003,127,Don't worry, I'll be with you!
SK1003,128,(Yeah, that's not the issue here...)
SK1003,129,Hmm, what to do...
SK1003,130,Oh, come on! You're not busy anyway, right?
SK1003,131,Unless... you don't wanna go with me?
SK1003,132,N-No, that's not it...
SK1003,133,Then we're going, and that's that!
SK1003,134,(Ohh boy... Looks like my vacation has been decided for me.)
SK1003,135,OK, I'm gonna wait for you in my room.
SK1003,136,When you're done getting ready to go, come and get me. Bye-bye!
SK1003,137,I'd better look my best if I'm going to meet Iris's parents.
SK1003,138,OK, I'll head to my room for a change of clothes, then meet Iris at her room.
SK1003,139,Hey Chief, got a sec?
SK1003,140,Hm?
SK1003,141,Hey Kohran. Did you need something?
SK1003,142,Any interest in going to Kobe with me?
SK1003,143,Whoa, did you say Kobe?
SK1003,144,I might've mentioned it before, but Kobe's where I went to live when I came to Japan, and where my dad is.
SK1003,145,His name's Percy Howard.
SK1003,146,He's the one who taught me everything I know about machines.
SK1003,147,Really? Wow...
SK1003,148,I'm pretty eager for you to meet him. What do you say?
SK1003,149,All right, let's go.
SK1003,150,What sort of person is he?
SK1003,151,All right, let's go. I'd like to meet him, myself.
SK1003,152,Thanks Chief! I figured you'd wanna come along.
SK1003,153,So, what sort of person is he?
SK1003,154,He must be pretty incredible if he taught you so much about machines.
SK1003,155,Heheh... I'll let you find that out for yourself once you meet him.
SK1003,156,O-Oh yeah? Now I'm kind of nervous.
SK1003,157,Hmm, what to do...
SK1003,158,Just humor me, will ya? Vacation's the perfect time to go on a little trip!
SK1003,159,You can even bring the Cinematron with you for a little peace of mind.
SK1003,160,Yeah... I suppose you're right.
SK1003,161,Alrighty, I'll be hanging around my room.
SK1003,162,Come and grab me when you're ready to go.
SK1003,163,If I'm going to meet the man who took care of Kohran, I should probably be dressed a bit nicer.
SK1003,164,OK, I'll head to my room to change my clothes, then meet up with Kohran at her room.
SK1003,165,Oh Ennnsign!
SK1003,166,Hm?
SK1003,167,Hey, Orihime. Did you need something?
SK1003,168,As I said so before, my mamma will be coming to visit Japan.
SK1003,169,And since my papa is all healed now and leaving the hospital...
SK1003,170,We all plan to meet at a hotel in the capital. How would you like to come along, Ensign?
SK1003,171,I'd be pleased to join you.
SK1003,172,Are you sure you want me to come?
SK1003,173,I wouldn't want to intrude.
SK1003,174,If you'll have me, I'd be pleased to join you. I'd really like to meet your mother.
SK1003,175,My thanks! My mamma is sure to be pleased, too!
SK1003,176,Are you sure it's all right for me to barge in on a family reunion, though?
SK1003,177,But of course!
SK1003,178,My parents were only reunited at all because of you, Ensign.
SK1003,179,I see... Then I suppose I'll take you up on your offer.
SK1003,180,So you will be coming? Grazie!
SK1003,181,Oh, I wouldn't want to intrude. You haven't seen each other in so long, after all...
SK1003,182,What are you saying?! We could hardly even start the reunion without you!
SK1003,183,My parents were only reunited at all because of you, Ensign!
SK1003,184,Sure, but...
SK1003,185,I insist, now! Let us be off!
SK1003,186,...In that case, I suppose I'll take you up on your offer.
SK1003,187,So you will be coming? Grazie!
SK1003,188,Hmm, what to do...
SK1003,189,Oh, come now, Ensign!
SK1003,190,Papa and Mamma will be so disappointed if I do not bring you along.
SK1003,191,I see... Then I suppose I'll take you up on your offer.
SK1003,192,Then you will be coming with me? Grazie!
SK1003,193,When you are ready, do come to let me know.
SK1003,194,I'll be waiting inside of my room. Until then!
SK1003,195,So I'll be meeting Orihime's parents... In that case, I'd better dress nicely for the occasion.
SK1003,196,OK, I'll head to my room for a change of clothes, then meet Orihime at her room.
SK1003,197,Ogami.
SK1003,198,Hm?
SK1003,199,Oh, hi Kaede. What did you need?
SK1003,200,It's about Reni, actually...
SK1003,201,She has no family or hometown to return to... She'll be all alone on New Years'.
SK1003,202,I see... Poor Reni...
SK1003,203,I was wondering if you might be willing to spend some time with her.
SK1003,204,Since it's New Years', perhaps you two could go on the first shrine visit of the year together?
SK1003,205,Sure, will do.
SK1003,206,Is Reni... OK with that?
SK1003,207,Sure, will do. I'll go invite her now.
SK1003,208,Thank you, Ogami. I'm sure Reni will appreciate it, too.
SK1003,209,Is that really something Reni would want to do?
SK1003,210,Don't worry. This will be a new experience for her.
SK1003,211,And besides, you'd be with her.
SK1003,212,R-Right...
SK1003,213,Hmm, what to do...
SK1003,214,Say, Ogami...
SK1003,215,I think it's likely Reni's never spent the New Year with anyone before.
SK1003,216,...
SK1003,217,But this year is different, because she has you beside her now.
SK1003,218,I'm sure that if she's with you, Reni will have an enjoyable New Years' holiday.
SK1003,219,So you'll go with her, won't you?
SK1003,220,All right, then. I'll go invite her now.
SK1003,221,Thank you, Ogami. I'm sure Reni will appreciate it, too.
SK1003,222,I'm sure she'll be in her room, so let her know when you're ready.
SK1003,223,Sure, will do.
SK1003,224,It'll be fun for you to get dressed up and go out on occasion, too.
SK1003,225,That's true... Since I'm going out, I may as well put on something nicer.
SK1003,226,OK, I'll head to my room for a change of clothes, then meet Reni at her room.
SK1003,227,Sorry, Ogami, but each customer is only allowed to purchase one photo at a time.
SK1003,228,I see. That's too bad.
SK1003,229,My apologies, Ogami, but each customer is only allowed to purchase one photo at a time.
SK1003,230,Oh, really? That's too bad.

SK1004,1,Whoops, it's almost 8:30.
SK1004,2,Can't dawdle around too long. Better head to my room and get changed.
SK1004,3,Whoops, I still haven't changed.
SK1004,4,I'm going to visit Sakura's family, I'd better dress right.
SK1004,5,I wonder if Sakura's ready yet?
SK1004,6,It's just like Sakura to have a cute nameplate like this.
SK1004,7,We can't wait around too much longer, so I'll call out to her.
SK1004,8,Sakura, I'm here.
SK1004,9,OK! I'll be right out!
SK1004,10,Sorry to keep you waiting.
SK1004,11,Wow, Ogami, you got all dressed up for this?
SK1004,12,Wouldn't want to be rude.
SK1004,13,How do I look?
SK1004,14,I'm meeting your mother, after all. Wouldn't want to be rude.
SK1004,15,Heehee, you really didn't have to...
SK1004,16,But I think it looks great on you, Ogami.
SK1004,17,R-Really? Thanks.
SK1004,18,I figured I'd dress nicely, since we're going out. How do I look?
SK1004,19,It suits you very well.
SK1004,20,You actually dressed up for me...
SK1004,21,I'm so glad...
SK1004,22,Sakura...
SK1004,23,U-Um...
SK1004,24,Heehee, no need to be shy, Ogami.
SK1004,25,I think that suit looks great on you.
SK1004,26,Y-You think so? Thanks, Sakura.
SK1004,27,All right then, let's say goodbye to the manager and be on our way.
SK1004,28,All right, got it. We'll ask him to watch the fort for us.
SK1004,29,Right! Let's head to his office.
SK1004,30,I wonder if Sakura's in her room?
SK1004,31,Oh, Ogami? Did you need something?
SK1004,32,No, not particularly...
SK1004,33,I see. That's good. I was just about to leave for Sendai.
SK1004,34,I'll be going now. I'll miss the train if I don't hurry.
SK1004,35,Give your mother my regards.
SK1004,36,Get me a souvenir.
SK1004,37,Safe travels. Give your mother my regards.
SK1004,38,Thank you. I'll be sure to tell her.
SK1004,39,Get me a souvenir while you're there, OK, Sakura?
SK1004,40,Heehee, understood. Look forward to it.
SK1004,41,I'm going to be late for the train, Ogami, so if you don't mind...
SK1004,42,Y-Yeah, right. Sorry.
SK1004,43,I'll be going, then. Have a pleasant New Year's vacation, Ogami.
SK1004,44,Yeah, see you.
SK1004,45,She left...
SK1004,46,I should get dressed and get ready to leave, too.
SK1004,47,Sakura just left for Sendai, right?
SK1004,48,No use staying here with her gone. I'll go visit another room.
SK1004,49,Whoops, I still haven't changed.
SK1004,50,I'm going to visit Sumire's family, I'd better dress right.
SK1004,51,I wonder if Sumire's ready yet?
SK1004,52,We can't wait around too much longer, so I'll call out to her.
SK1004,53,This is a pretty subtle design, considering it's Sumire.
SK1004,54,Sumire, I'm here.
SK1004,55,Yes, just a moment.
SK1004,56,Apologies for the wait, Ensign.
SK1004,57,Well, aren't you well dressed, Ensign.
SK1004,58,Because I'm meeting your parents.
SK1004,59,How do I look?
SK1004,60,I am meeting your parents, after all. Wouldn't want to be rude.
SK1004,61,Oh, Ensign. You shouldn't worry about that.
SK1004,62,But I must say, that's a fabulous suit.
SK1004,63,Y-You think so? Thanks, Sumire.
SK1004,64,I figured I'd dress nicely, since we're going out. How do I look?
SK1004,65,Yes, it suits you very well.
SK1004,66,There's not a doubt in my mind that together we'll be the center of attention.
SK1004,67,R-Really? Now I'm feeling kinda shy...
SK1004,68,U-Um...
SK1004,69,There's no need to be shy, Ensign.
SK1004,70,I think that suit looks fabulous on you. Have some confidence.
SK1004,71,Y-You think so? Thanks, Sumire.
SK1004,72,Well then, Sumire, shall we get going?
SK1004,73,Why don't we bid farewell to the manager before we leave?
SK1004,74,Yeah, you're right. We'll let him know, just to be safe.
SK1004,75,Right then, let's make our way to the manager's office.
SK1004,76,There, the door's locked tight...
SK1004,77,Hey, Sumire. Heading out already?
SK1004,78,Oh my, Ensign...
SK1004,79,Yes, I was just about to go on my trip.
SK1004,80,Well, I say "trip", but my home is in Yokohama, so I'll be there soon.
SK1004,81,Give your family my regards.
SK1004,82,Are you coming back this time?
SK1004,83,Safe travels. Give your family my regards.
SK1004,84,I did force my way in back during the arranged marriage incident, after all.
SK1004,85,Understood. I'll be sure to let them know.
SK1004,86,Sumire... You WILL be coming back this time, right?
SK1004,87,Ohohohoho. You need not worry, Ensign.
SK1004,88,I don't believe my family has any intention of keeping me there anymore...
SK1004,89,And even if they did, this time I would force my way out on my own.
SK1004,90,Sumire...
SK1004,91,Did you need something, Ensign?
SK1004,92,N-No, not really...
SK1004,93,Then I'll be on my way. Have a lovely New Year, Ensign.
SK1004,94,Yeah, thanks.
SK1004,95,She left...
SK1004,96,I should get dressed and get ready to leave, too.
SK1004,97,Sumire just went back home, right?
SK1004,98,No use staying here, then. I should visit another room.
SK1004,99,Whoops, I still haven't changed.
SK1004,100,I'll be visiting Count Hanakoji, so I'd better dress right.
SK1004,101,I wonder if Maria's ready yet?
SK1004,102,We can't wait around too much longer, so I'll call out to her.
SK1004,103,It's Maria's nameplate. It has simplistic design.
SK1004,104,Maria, I'm here.
SK1004,105,Captain? I'll be right out.
SK1004,106,Apologies for the wait, sir.
SK1004,107,Oh, you changed into your formal wear.
SK1004,108,Wouldn't want to be rude.
SK1004,109,How do I look?
SK1004,110,I'm going to be meeting Count Hanakoji. Wouldn't want to be rude.
SK1004,111,I see. Considerate as always, sir.
SK1004,112,I figured I'd dress nicely, since we're going out. How do I look?
SK1004,113,Yes, it suits you quite well.
SK1004,114,Really? Hearing you say that makes it worth having changed.
SK1004,115,Captain... Um...
SK1004,116,That suit... looks good on you.
SK1004,117,Maria... Thanks.
SK1004,118,Right then, shall we get going?
SK1004,119,Why don't we stop and say goodbye to the manager before we leave?
SK1004,120,Yeah, you're right. Let's let him know before we head out.
SK1004,121,OK. To the manager's office, then.
SK1004,122,Oh, Captain.
SK1004,123,On your way out, Maria?
SK1004,124,Yes. I'm going to give Count Hanakoji my New Year's greetings.
SK1004,125,Give him my regards.
SK1004,126,You're going out of your way.
SK1004,127,I'm sad I can't go with you, but make sure to give him my regards.
SK1004,128,All right, understood. I'll give him your well wishes.
SK1004,129,Sounds like a lot of trouble for a New Year's greeting.
SK1004,130,Yes, but I owe a lot to Count Hanakoji.
SK1004,131,If you don't need anything, sir, then I'll be going.
SK1004,132,R-Right. Sorry.
SK1004,133,Well then, I'm off. Have a pleasant New Year's holiday, Captain.
SK1004,134,Yeah, thanks. See you.
SK1004,135,Right, I should get dressed and get ready to leave, too.
SK1004,136,Maria left to visit Count Hanakoji, right?
SK1004,137,No use staying here, then. I should visit another room.
SK1004,138,Whoops, I still haven't changed.
SK1004,139,Since we're going all the way to Okinawa, I'd better dress up right.
SK1004,140,I wonder if Kanna's ready?
SK1004,141,We can't wait around too much longer, so I'll call out to her.
SK1004,142,Kanna's nameplate... It looks more like a nametag to me.
SK1004,143,Kanna, I'm here.
SK1004,144,Hey, I've been waitin' for ya! I'll be right out.
SK1004,145,Yo, sorry to keep you waiting!
SK1004,146,Ooh, all dressed up, eh, Boss?
SK1004,147,Since we're traveling...
SK1004,148,How do I look?
SK1004,149,We're traveling all the way to Okinawa, so I figured I'd dress for the occasion.
SK1004,150,Ahahaha! You didn't have to put in that much effort, though.
SK1004,151,Still, you look cool, Boss. I'm not just sayin' that, either.
SK1004,152,Hahaha, really? Thanks, Kanna.
SK1004,153,I thought I'd dress in something more formal... How do I look?
SK1004,154,You're lookin' cool, Boss.
SK1004,155,I'm so used to you in your regular clothes, so this feels kinda fresh.
SK1004,156,Hahaha, thanks.
SK1004,157,Anyway, I didn't know you had clothes like that.
SK1004,158,I'm so used to you in your regular clothes, so this feels kinda fresh.
SK1004,159,Hahaha, well, I haven't had many opportunities to dress nicely like this.
SK1004,160,All right, Kanna, shall we get going?
SK1004,161,Before we do, how's about we tell the manager goodbye?
SK1004,162,Yeah, you're right. Let's let him know before we head out.
SK1004,163,All right, let's swing by the manager's office.
SK1004,164,I wonder if Kanna's in her room?
SK1004,165,Oh, Boss? What's up?
SK1004,166,Nothing, I just thought you might've left already.
SK1004,167,I was just thinking of leaving, actually.
SK1004,168,I'm gonna spend some time in Okinawa and visit my dad's grave.
SK1004,169,Looking forward to my souvenir.
SK1004,170,Come back quickly this time, OK?
SK1004,171,Safe travels. I'm looking forward to my souvenir.
SK1004,172,Yeah, don't worry, I'll bring back tons of rare Okinawan goodies.
SK1004,173,Come back quickly this time, OK?
SK1004,174,Yeah, got it. I'm not training this time, though, just visiting.
SK1004,175,I'll make sure to be back before the New Year's holiday's over.
SK1004,176,If you don't need anything, Boss, I'm gonna get goin'.
SK1004,177,R-Right. Sorry.
SK1004,178,All right, I'm off. See ya when I get back!
SK1004,179,Yeah. Have a safe trip, OK?
SK1004,180,Yeah, yeah, I know. See ya, Boss.
SK1004,181,Kanna's gone now, huh?
SK1004,182,I should get dressed and get ready to leave, too.
SK1004,183,Kanna already left for Okinawa.
SK1004,184,There's no use staying around here. I should go somewhere else.
SK1004,185,Whoops, I still haven't changed.
SK1004,186,I'll be meeting Iris's parents, so I'd better dress up right.
SK1004,187,I wonder if Iris is ready?
SK1004,188,We can't wait around too much longer, so I'll call out to her.
SK1004,189,So Iris's nameplate is shaped like Jean-Paul.
SK1004,190,Iris, I'm here.
SK1004,191,Okaaay! Just a second!
SK1004,192,Sorry to keep you waiting, Mon Frère.
SK1004,193,Wooow! You look cool, Mon Frère!
SK1004,194,Wouldn't want to be rude.
SK1004,195,How do I look?
SK1004,196,I'm meeting your parents, after all. I wouldn't want to be rude.
SK1004,197,Thanks, Mon Frère. I'm sure Papa and Mama will be happy about that.
SK1004,198,I figured I'd dress nicely, since we're going out. How do I look?
SK1004,199,You look super cool!
SK1004,200,Kinda feels like we're going on a date!
SK1004,201,Hahaha, thank you Iris.
SK1004,202,Thanks for dressing up so nicely for me, Mon Frère...
SK1004,203,Hahaha, I'm always wearing the same old thing, so I figured I'd change things up.
SK1004,204,Right, we should get going, Iris.
SK1004,205,Let's go say bye to Uncle Yoneda before we leave!
SK1004,206,Yeah, you're right. We'll let him know we're leaving.
SK1004,207,OK, Jean-Paul, let's get going.
SK1004,208,Ah, Mon frère!
SK1004,209,Hey Iris. Off to see your papa and mama?
SK1004,210,Uh-huh! Jean-Paul's coming along too!
SK1004,211,Papa and Mama came all the way from France by boat, so I'm meeting them at the harbor.
SK1004,212,Tell them I said hi.
SK1004,213,Can you get there alone?
SK1004,214,Sorry I can't be there to greet them, but tell them I said hi, OK?
SK1004,215,OK. I'm gonna tell them so much about you!
SK1004,216,Hahaha, thanks.
SK1004,217,Can you get there by yourself?
SK1004,218,Auntie Kaede told me how to get there, so I'll be all right!
SK1004,219,Papa and Mama are gonna be so surprised when they find out I made it there by myself!
SK1004,220,Hahaha, I see now. Just be careful on the way there, OK?
SK1004,221,OK! Thanks, Mon Frère!
SK1004,222,I'm gonna have lunch with Papa and Mama...
SK1004,223,And then I'm gonna tell them all kindsa stories... And then... And then...
SK1004,224,I'm gonna be with them the whole time!
SK1004,225,Hahaha, I see. Have fun.
SK1004,226,All right, I'm gonna go now. Bye-bye, Mon Frère!
SK1004,227,Yeah, see you.
SK1004,228,She left...
SK1004,229,I should get dressed and get ready to leave, too.
SK1004,230,Iris said she was meeting her parents at the harbor, right?
SK1004,231,I should get ready to head out, too.
SK1004,232,Whoops, I still haven't changed.
SK1004,233,I'm making the trip all the way to Kobe, so I'd better dress up right.
SK1004,234,I wonder if Kohran's ready?
SK1004,235,We can't wait around too much longer, so I'll call out to her.
SK1004,236,A gear-shaped nameplate, huh? It's just Kohran's style.
SK1004,237,Kohran, I'm here.
SK1004,238,Oh, Chief? Hang on, I'm coming.
SK1004,239,Heheh, all right, let's go...
SK1004,240,Ch-Chief? What's with the getup?
SK1004,241,Since we're going out...
SK1004,242,How do I look?
SK1004,243,Since we're going out to Kobe, I thought I'd dress up for the occasion.
SK1004,244,I see... Thanks a bunch, Chief!
SK1004,245,You got all nice and dressed up, just for me. For real, thanks.
SK1004,246,Kohran...
SK1004,247,I thought I'd dress in something more formal... How do I look?
SK1004,248,I was kinda shocked at first, but it looks great on you!
SK1004,249,Besides, your usual outfit leaves such a strong impression, this feels kinda fresh.
SK1004,250,Hahaha, I see.
SK1004,251,At any rate, I never knew you had an outfit like this.
SK1004,252,I'm so used to your regular outfit, this feels kinda fresh.
SK1004,253,Hahaha, well, I haven't had many opportunities to dress nicely like this.
SK1004,254,All right, let's go talk to Yoneda before we duck out.
SK1004,255,Yeah, you're right. Let's let him know we're leaving.
SK1004,256,Ah, Chief!
SK1004,257,Hey, Kohran. Heading out?
SK1004,258,Yep. Going on a leisurely boat ride straight to Kobe.
SK1004,259,It's been ages since I last saw Mr. Howard, I can't wait.
SK1004,260,Give him my regards.
SK1004,261,What kind of person is he?
SK1004,262,Give Mr. Howard my regards.
SK1004,263,Sure, leave it to me. I'm gonna tell him all about ya.
SK1004,264,A-All about me? What kinds of stories, exactly?
SK1004,265,Hahaha! Who can say?
SK1004,266,What kind of person is this Mr. Howard?
SK1004,267,He taught me all sorts of stuff about machinery.
SK1004,268,I also picked up my Japanese from him.
SK1004,269,I-I see... He sounds like an impressive person.
SK1004,270,If you don't need anything, Chief, I'm gonna head out now.
SK1004,271,I see... Be careful, OK?
SK1004,272,All right, I gotta catch my boat, so I'm heading out.
SK1004,273,Take it easy, all right? 
SK1004,274,Yeah, I will. All right, I'm off!
SK1004,275,Mr. Howard... Just what kind of person is he, exactly?
SK1004,276,Well, I should get dressed and get ready to leave, too.
SK1004,277,Kohran just left, right?
SK1004,278,There's no use staying around here. I should go somewhere else.
SK1004,279,Whoops, I still haven't changed.
SK1004,280,I'll be meeting Orihime's parents, so I'd better dress up right.
SK1004,281,I wonder if Orihime's ready?
SK1004,282,We can't wait around too much longer, so I'll call out to her.
SK1004,283,The name plate has a simple design, but it sure looks classy.
SK1004,284,Orihime, I'm here.
SK1004,285,OK, coming!
SK1004,286,Sorry to keep you waiting, Ensign.
SK1004,287,Ah, Ensign, you changed clothes?
SK1004,288,Because I'm meeting your parents.
SK1004,289,How do I look?
SK1004,290,I figured I should, since I'm meeting your parents. Wouldn't want to be rude.
SK1004,291,A true gentiluomo as always, Ensign.
SK1004,292,I'm sure Mamma will take a liking to you, too.
SK1004,293,Hahaha, that'd be nice.
SK1004,294,I thought I'd dress in something more formal... How do I look?
SK1004,295,I think it looks great on you!
SK1004,296,You'd fit right into European high society!
SK1004,297,Hahaha, thanks, Orihime.
SK1004,298,P-Please don't stare like that, I'm getting embarrassed.
SK1004,299,There's nothing to be embarrassed about, Ensign.
SK1004,300,A man's appearance is one of his finest weapons, after all!
SK1004,301,I-I see...
SK1004,302,That reminds me, since we're leaving the theater...
SK1004,303,We should talk to Yoneda first, just to be safe.
SK1004,304,Yeah, you're right. OK then, let's stop by his office.
SK1004,305,There, door's shut tight.
SK1004,306,Hey, Orihime. Headed out already?
SK1004,307,Ah, Ensign.
SK1004,308,You're going to see your mother, right?
SK1004,309,Yes, that's right. Mamma came to Japan all the way from Italy.
SK1004,310,Finally... Mamma and Papa finally get to be together again!
SK1004,311,Give them my regards.
SK1004,312,I'm happy for you.
SK1004,313,I won't be able to see them, but give them my regards, OK?
SK1004,314,Yeah, got it. I'll be telling Mamma all about you.
SK1004,315,I'm happy for you, Orihime. Your parents finally get to be reunited.
SK1004,316,Yes! And it's all thanks to you, Ensign.
SK1004,317,I'm sorry I can't be there to see them...
SK1004,318,But you have a nice long chat with them, as a family.
SK1004,319,Ensign... Thank you.
SK1004,320,I truly wish we could go together...
SK1004,321,I'm sorry, Orihime. I probably should go and meet them, but...
SK1004,322,It's OK!
SK1004,323,I'll tell Papa and Mamma all about you!
SK1004,324,All right then, Ensign, I should get going now.
SK1004,325,All right, be careful. See you soon.
SK1004,326,Orihime must be so happy. Her parents are finally reunited after over a dozen years.
SK1004,327,Well, I should get dressed and get ready to leave, too.
SK1004,328,Orihime just left, right?
SK1004,329,I should get ready to head out, too.
SK1004,330,Whoops, I still haven't changed.
SK1004,331,I ought to dress nicely for my first shrine visit of the year.
SK1004,332,I wonder if Reni's in her room?
SK1004,333,Since it's New Year's, I'll try inviting her out for a shrine visit.
SK1004,334,Reni... Still using notebook paper as a nameplate, I see.
SK1004,335,Reni, are you there? It's Ogami.
SK1004,336,Captain? Just a second.
SK1004,337,Sorry to keep you waiting.
SK1004,338,Captain... Your clothes are different.
SK1004,339,Yeah. I was going to invite you out to a New Year's shrine visit, so I thought I'd change clothes.
SK1004,340,A shrine visit... With me?
SK1004,341,Yeah. It's New Year's, so why not?
SK1004,342,But...
SK1004,343,Don't worry, let's go.
SK1004,344,Do you not want to go?
SK1004,345,Don't worry, let's go. Meiji Shrine is practically next door.
SK1004,346,This will be your first New Year's shrine visit, right? There's all kinds of interesting things to see.
SK1004,347,True, I might be able to observe many customs unknown to me.
SK1004,348,All right then, I'll go too, sir.
SK1004,349,Really? Great, let's go!
SK1004,350,Do you not want to go, Reni?
SK1004,351,That's not it...
SK1004,352,It's New Year's, so we shouldn't shut ourselves away in the theater all day.
SK1004,353,OK, I see. It's true that I might be able to observe many customs unknown to me.
SK1004,354,Hahaha, "unknown customs", I see. That's very like you.
SK1004,355,OK then, Reni, let's get going.
SK1004,356,Are you sure you want to go with me, sir?
SK1004,357,What are you talking about? Of course I do.
SK1004,358,Why would I invite you if I didn't want to go with you?
SK1004,359,Captain...
SK1004,360,All right, Reni, let's get going.
SK1004,361,O-OK.
SK1004,362,I wonder if Reni's in her room?
SK1004,363,...Captain.
SK1004,364,Hey, Reni. Did you just get back to your room?
SK1004,365,Yeah. Did you need something, sir?
SK1004,366,No, I was just wondering how you were going to spend your New Year's holiday.
SK1004,367,I'll be going on a New Year's shrine visit with Kaede later.
SK1004,368,The custom is still unknown to me. I think it'll be a positive experience.
SK1004,369,Have fun.
SK1004,370,Which shrine are you visiting?
SK1004,371,This is your first Japanese New Year, right? Have fun on your shrine visit.
SK1004,372,OK, I will.
SK1004,373,Which shrine are you going to visit?
SK1004,374,It's a place called Meiji Shrine.
SK1004,375,I see, tons of people flock there for New Year's every year.
SK1004,376,By the way, sir, did you need me for something?
SK1004,377,No, not particularly...
SK1004,378,I see. That's fine.
SK1004,379,I'll be going back to my room, then.
SK1004,380,Look after the place for me while I'm out, OK?
SK1004,381,Got it. Have a safe trip, Captain.
SK1004,382,So Reni's staying at the theater and going on a shrine visit, huh?
SK1004,383,Well, I'd better get ready to head out, then.
SK1004,384,Reni said she's going on a shrine visit with Kaede, right?
SK1004,385,I should get ready to head out, too.
SK1004,386,Right, I should get ready to head out.
SK1004,387,Yo, Ogami. Long time no see.
SK1004,388,That voice... Is that you, Kayama?
SK1004,389,New Year's is lovely, isn't it, Ogami?
SK1004,390,What a joy it is to greet the new year with you!
SK1004,391,You never change, do you? Is the Moon Division on break for New Year's, too?
SK1004,392,Yes. However, should anything happen, we'll still deploy immediately.
SK1004,393,They say New Year's Day is the key to the year. You must focus and steel yourself for the coming year.
SK1004,394,I see...
SK1004,395,Now then, farewell, Ogami. Here's hoping we both enjoy a pleasant New Year.
SK1004,396,What an extravagant guy. He wore a tuxedo and everything, just for a New Year's greeting.
SK1004,397,It's been a long time since I've had to dress nicely like this.
SK1004,398,There, I should be all ready now.
SK1004,399,Go to Sakura's room.
SK1004,400,Go to Sumire's room.
SK1004,401,Go to Maria's room.
SK1004,402,Go to Kanna's room.
SK1004,403,Go to Iris' room.
SK1004,404,Go to Kohran's room.
SK1004,405,Go to Orihime's room.
SK1004,406,Grab Cinematron.
SK1004,407,Oops, better bring the Cinematron if I'm heading out.
SK1004,408,That way, if anything happens, we can get in touch with the theater right away.
SK1004,409,Eh, no need to bring the Cinematron. All right, let's go.
SK1004,410,Right, I'll go to Reni's room.
SK1004,411,Kaede? Are you in there?
SK1004,412,All right, I'm gonna go somewhere else.
SK1004,413,It's Ogami. Are you there, Kaede?
SK1004,414,...
SK1004,415,Huh? Is she gone? Where did she go?
SK1004,416,I wonder if Mr. Yoneda is in here. 
SK1004,417,I better check another room, I guess.
SK1004,418,Are you there, sir? It's Ogami.
SK1004,419,...
SK1004,420,Huh? Doesn't seem like the manager's in.
SK1004,421,Ah, Ogami! Happy New Year!
SK1004,422,Hey, Tsubaki. Happy New Year.
SK1004,423,Heehee, you came at just the right time, Ogami.
SK1004,424,Huh?
SK1004,425,You see, we have a special gift for our most loyal customers:
SK1004,426,A special photo, only available on New Year's!
SK1004,427,I prepared these specially for you as thanks for always buying photos.
SK1004,428,All right, Ogami, you can pick only one photo.
SK1004,429,That's Sakura's special photo.
SK1004,430,It's a cute photo of Sakura in her swimsuit, with a teasing smile on her face.
SK1004,431,All right, I'll take Sakura's.
SK1004,432,Here you go, Sakura's special photo! Thank you, come again!
SK1004,433,That's Sumire's special photo.

SK1004,436,Here you go, Sumire's special photo! Thank you, come again!
SK1004,437,That's Maria's special photo.

SK1004,449,That's Kohran's special photo.
SK1004,450,This is a private photo of Kohran in her work clothes. Truly one-of-a-kind!
SK1004,451,All right, I'll take Kohran's.
SK1004,452,Here you go, Kohran's special photo! Thank you, come again!
SK1004,453,That's Orihime's special photo.
SK1004,454,It's a photo of Orihime in her distinctively stylish swimsuit.
SK1004,455,All right, I'll take Orihime's.
SK1004,456,Here you go, Orihime's special photo! Thank you, come again!
SK1004,457,That's Reni's special photo.
SK1004,458,It's a photo of Reni in her role as Tyltyl in "The Bluebird."
SK1004,459,All right, I'll take Reni's.
SK1004,460,Here you go, Reni's special photo! Thank you, come again!
SK1004,461,Don't be shy, Ogami. Pick whichever photo you'd like.
SK1004,462,Thanks, Tsubaki. I'll cherish this photo.
SK1004,463,No, I should be the one thanking you for your continued patronage.
SK1004,464,I'll be getting a lot of new photos this year, so I hope you look forward to them!
SK1004,465,OK, I have to get back to work, so I'll be going now.
SK1004,466,Right. Good luck.
SK1004,467,Now... What to do next?
SK1004,468,Ah, Ogami!
SK1004,469,Hey, Tsubaki. Happy New Year.
SK1004,470,Happy New Year! Looking forward to working with you for another year!
SK1004,471,Huh? Not running the store today?
SK1004,472,That's right. The store's closed for the New Year's holiday.
SK1004,473,I-I see. That's too bad.
SK1004,474,You can always buy a photo once the holiday's over.
SK1004,475,Please be patient until then.
SK1004,476,You're right. All right, I'll come back once the holiday's over, then.
SK1004,477,OK! I'll be waiting!
SK1004,478,Right then, what to do next?
SK1004,479,Hey Tsubaki. Hard at work, I see.
SK1004,480,Yes, since I'll be on vacation too, starting tomorrow.
SK1004,481,I'm getting everything sorted now so that once we get back, I can start work on the right foot!
SK1004,482,I see. Good luck.
SK1004,483,Ah, Ogami! Happy New Year!
SK1004,484,Hey, Tsubomi. Happy New Year.
SK1004,485,It's been a month since I started working as a server.
SK1004,486,I think I'm starting to get used to this job.
SK1004,487,I see. That's great.
SK1004,488,My resolution this year is to be less scatterbrained!
SK1004,489,What's your New Year's resolution, Ogami?
SK1004,490,Strive to keep the peace.
SK1004,491,Perfect my ticket punching.
SK1004,492,Smile-smile!
SK1004,493,My resolution is to keep working hard to protect the peace. I'll do my best as the captain of the Flower Division.
SK1004,494,You're always so cool, Ogami!
SK1004,495,I'll try my hardest to be like everyone in the Flower Division, too!
SK1004,496,Hmm, I'd like to perfect my ticket punching skills this year.
SK1004,497,The path of the ticket puncher is a long and treacherous one...
SK1004,498,Whaaa? There's a path for ticket punchers? That's so deep...
SK1004,499,OK, then I'll try to perfect my waitressing, too!
SK1004,500,My resolution is to do my best with a "smile-smile", just like you, Tsubomi.
SK1004,501,OK! I'll be working hard with a smile-smile, too!
SK1004,502,Hmm... I haven't really decided yet.
SK1004,503,That's no good, Ogami. It's important to set goals, you know.
SK1004,504,You're right. I'll have to take some time to think about it.
SK1004,505,That would be for the best!
SK1004,506,Last month I burned all the food by leaving the pot on the flame...
SK1004,507,But this year, I'll cure myself of my scatterbrain so that will never...
SK1004,508,Ah!
SK1004,509,Wh-What is it?
SK1004,510,I forgot to light the fire this time! Aww, I really messed up!
SK1004,511,Hey, Tsubomi, kitchen is over here! Not there!
SK1004,512,Ah, I got mixed up! Thank you! And goodbye!
SK1004,513,Sheesh, some things never change...
SK1004,514,Sorry you had to see me like that earlier, Ogami...
SK1004,515,Hahaha, looks like that scatterbrain of yours got you again.
SK1004,516,Well no more! I absolutely won't be scatterbrained ever again!
SK1004,517,Haha, I see. At any rate, good luck.
SK1004,518,Or, do you need something right now, Ogami?
SK1004,519,You're gonna listen to my gossip, right, Ogami?
SK1004,520,My, you came here like clockwork, Ogami.
SK1004,521,If you're asking about rumors, I'm all out. Sorry.
SK1004,522,I see. That's too bad.
SK1004,523,I'll have some more interesting tidbits for you another time, so look forward to it!
SK1004,524,Ah, Ogami! Happy New Year!
SK1004,525,Here's to another year of working together.
SK1004,526,Happy New Year to you two as well.
SK1004,527,I feel completely refreshed this year! I even have a ton of new juicy gossip!
SK1004,528,Happy New Year, everybody.
SK1004,529,Oh, I was wondering who that was! It's Ichiro!
SK1004,530,Happy... New Year... Ogami.
SK1004,531,Here's to another year of working together, Ensign Ogami.
SK1004,532,Yeah, likewise.
SK1004,533,Ichiro, I got to see "The Miracle Bells", you know!
SK1004,534,Um... I was... Deeply moved.
SK1004,535,It must've been quite difficult to choose the lead.
SK1004,536,It really was...
SK1004,537,Oh, speaking of choosing, there's something I wanted to ask you, Ichiro.
SK1004,538,So, out of us three, who would you say is more your type?
SK1004,539,Kotone.
SK1004,540,Yokihiko.
SK1004,541,Kikunojo.
SK1004,542,If I was forced to pick, then... I guess Kotone?
SK1004,543,Just as I expected, Ensign. You have a discerning eye.
SK1004,544,This beauty of mine, so potent it drives even men mad with love...
SK1004,545,To call it criminal wouldn't even be an exaggeration.
SK1004,546,Ogami...
SK1004,547,Hmph! You have no taste in men, Ichiro!
SK1004,548,If I was forced to pick, then... I guess Yokihiko?
SK1004,549,Ichirooo! I knew you'd say that!
SK1004,550,Maybe today I'll finally get my long-awaited kiss from you...
SK1004,551,Y-Yokihiko!
SK1004,552,That's enough, Yokihiko! You're scaring Ensign Ogami!
SK1004,553,Hmph, you're all just jealous!
SK1004,554,If I was forced to pick, then... I guess Kikunojo?
SK1004,555,Really... Ogami?
SK1004,556,I'm... I'm so... happy...
SK1004,557,Oh, Ichiro... You're too soft on Kiku.
SK1004,558,Perhaps Ensign Ogami is still too young to recognize my beauty...
SK1004,559,I... don't think I have a type...
SK1004,560,Oh please, Ichiro! You're so fickle!
SK1004,561,It seems you're still not ready to recognize my beauty.
SK1004,562,B-But still... I'm kind of relieved...
SK1004,563,U-Um, I've got things to do, so I'm gonna...
SK1004,564,Ogami... Are you leaving?
SK1004,565,Since you're here, why not spend New Year's with us?
SK1004,566,Oh, that's a wonderful idea! I'm gonna be keeping you up all night, Ichiro!
SK1004,567,Eep! I... I gotta go!!
SK1004,568,Phew... The New Year just started and I'm already getting into danger.
SK1004,569,At any rate, how do they intend to spend the New Year, anyway?
SK1004,570,Ah... Ogami.
SK1004,571,Ensign Ogami, you came back.
SK1004,572,OK everyone, let's make sure to grab him this time!
SK1004,573,Eep?! H-Help!!
SK1004,574,Phew... Managed to get away somehow...
SK1004,575,Seriously, why do I keep setting foot in that room?
SK1004,576,Hm? Looks like someone's taking a bath.
SK1004,577,I thought everyone was getting ready to go home... Who could be in there?
SK1004,578,Hm? What are you up to, Ogami?
SK1004,579,M-Mr. Yoneda!
SK1004,580,Ohh? Seems like someone's taking a bath.
SK1004,581,These clothes... They look like Kaede's.
SK1004,582,Huh? Did you say... Kaede?!
SK1004,583,My body's moving towards the bath on its own...
SK1004,584,Go back outside.
SK1004,585,My body's moving on its own... I-I can't control it... 
SK1004,586,H-Hey! Where do you think you're going, Ogami!
SK1004,587,It's no good! I... can't... stop!
SK1004,588,Phew, it's nice to take a bath first thing in the morning.
SK1004,589,(Kaede...)
SK1004,590,(Dammit, Ogami, get back here!)
SK1004,591,(Hey, you're staring too, aren't you?!)
SK1004,592,(That's beside the point! Get back here before she sees you!)
SK1004,593,Ow ow ow! I get it already, please let go of me, sir!
SK1004,594,N-Not so loud, dumbass!
SK1004,595,...!!
SK1004,596,Those voices... Don't tell me...?!
SK1004,597,(C-Crap!)
SK1004,598,Make an excuse.
SK1004,599,Run away.
SK1004,600,Make an excuse.
SK1004,601,K-Kaede... Um, this was a total accident.
SK1004,602,S-Sorry Kaede, I tried to stop him, but...
SK1004,603,I don't care! Just get out!
SK1004,604,Y-Yes, ma'am!!
SK1004,605,I can't believe this happened with the manager around...
SK1004,606,N-No, you see...
SK1004,607,...No, we're sorry. Forgive us, Kaede.
SK1004,608,At any rate, nobody likes being peeped on in the bath.
SK1004,609,I want you two to think about what you've done.
SK1004,610,Y-Yes, ma'am! We're truly sorry.
SK1004,611,...Sorry, Kaede.
SK1004,612,...
SK1004,613,Hm hm, all right, I forgive you.
SK1004,614,Well then, I'll be going. See you later, you two.
SK1004,615,Thank goodness she forgave us, eh, sir?
SK1004,616,Yeah. She's skilled at martial arts, you know, just like Ayame was...
SK1004,617,So if she REALLY got mad, we would've been in big trouble.
SK1004,618,I-Is that so... I think I broke out in a cold sweat just hearing that.
SK1004,619,L-Let's get out of here, sir!
SK1004,620,R-Right! Hurry, Ogami!
SK1004,621,Phew... Looks like we made it out of there. That was close...
SK1004,622,You don't think she noticed us, do you, sir?
SK1004,623,It's fine, relax. We got out of there right away. She didn't see us.
SK1004,624,R-Right...
SK1004,625,Kaede's skilled with martial arts, you know, just like Ayame was...
SK1004,626,So if she REALLY got mad, we would've been in big trouble.
SK1004,627,I-Is that so... I think I broke out in a cold sweat just hearing that.
SK1004,628,Those voices... It's you, Ogami and the manager!
SK1004,629,Ogami! We got caught thanks to your dawdling around!
SK1004,630,H-Hey! Only because you wouldn't stop pulling on me!
SK1004,631,Whatever! Just get out!!
SK1004,632,Y-Yes, ma'am!!
SK1004,633,I can't believe Mr. Yoneda let this happen...
SK1004,634,N-No, you see...
SK1004,635,...No, we're sorry. Forgive us, Kaede.
SK1004,636,At any rate, nobody likes being peeped on in the bath.
SK1004,637,I want you two to think about what you've done.
SK1004,638,Y-Yes, ma'am! We're truly sorry.
SK1004,639,...Sorry, Kaede.
SK1004,640,...
SK1004,641,Hm hm, all right, I forgive you.
SK1004,642,Well then, I'll be going. See you later, you two.
SK1004,643,Thank goodness she forgave us, eh, sir?
SK1004,644,Yeah. She's skilled at martial arts, you know, just like Ayame was...
SK1004,645,So if she REALLY got mad, we would've been in big trouble.
SK1004,646,I-Is that so... I think I broke out in a cold sweat just hearing that.
SK1004,647,We should leave, sir. We'd be in big trouble if we peeked into the bath.
SK1004,648,Yes, absolutely. Let's get out of here, Ogami.
SK1004,649,You did pretty well to resist temptation like that.
SK1004,650,Right then, I'll be going. Later, Ogami.
SK1004,651,Hmm... That felt like a wasted opportunity...
SK1004,652,No, this is for the best. Right, I'd better go.
SK1004,653,OK, time to get out of this bath.
SK1004,654,Eep! This is bad, sir!
SK1004,655,Dammit, no choice but to run!
SK1004,656,Good grief... I don't think she saw us.
SK1004,657,We would've really been in for it if we were a second too late.
SK1004,658,Kaede's skilled with martial arts, you know, just like Ayame was...
SK1004,659,So if she REALLY got mad, we would've been in big trouble.
SK1004,660,I-Is that so... I think I broke out in a cold sweat just hearing that.
SK1004,661,Oh, Ogami? Are you here to take a bath?
SK1004,662,Um, no, not exactly...
SK1004,663,That reminds me, I was taking a bath just now...
SK1004,664,And I could've sworn I heard you and the manager's voices...
SK1004,665,Huh?! Uh, w-well...
SK1004,666,Must've been my imagination. I know you'd never do anything like that.
SK1004,667,Hm hm, all right, I'll be going now. Take care, Ogami.
SK1004,668,Phew... Doesn't seem like she noticed after all.
SK1004,669,Right then, I should get going.
SK1004,670,Kaede's gone now, huh?
SK1004,671,Well, no use staying here. Let's go somewhere else.
SK1004,672,Kaede was taking a bath just earlier, right...?
SK1004,673,Now I feel kind of funny. I'd better leave.
SK1004,674,It's the New Year and everyone walking down the street looks bright and cheery.
SK1004,675,I'm truly glad we can enjoy a peaceful New Year.
SK1004,676,The theater's been on break ever since the Christmas play.
SK1004,677,I hope the Flower Division's plays draw big crowds this year, too.
SK1004,678,The Christmas play was a smashing success.
SK1004,679,I'm glad we were able to pull it off.
SK1004,680,No one's in the kitchen.
SK1004,681,Everyone should be in their rooms getting ready to leave right about now.
SK1004,682,With the Christmas play over and done with, the theater's on break for the New Year holiday.
SK1004,683,The entrance here will remain locked tight until the holiday's over.
SK1004,684,Arf, arf!
SK1004,685,Hey,
SK1004,686,! Happy New Year.
SK1004,687,Arf, arf, arf!
SK1004,688,Haha, I see you got yourself a New Year's bone, too.
SK1004,689,Well, there's not many of us guys here at the theater. Let's both do our best this year, all right?
SK1004,690,Arf!
SK1004,691,Arf, arf!
SK1004,692,I'll be heading out for a while.
SK1004,693,Look after the theater while I'm gone, OK?
SK1004,694,Guess Orihime's taking a vacation from piano for New Year's Day.
SK1004,695,Well, she did say her mother was coming to visit, so I guess now's not the time for piano.
SK1004,696,The costumes for "The Miracle Bells" sure were incredible.
SK1004,697,I still can't believe we managed to put together a play like that.
SK1004,698,Doesn't look like anyone's backstage anymore.
SK1004,699,Everyone must've gone back to their rooms to get ready for their trips.
SK1004,700,It's the New Year holiday, so rehearsals are also on hold for the time being.
SK1004,701,Everyone must be busy getting ready for their trips right about now.
SK1004,702,Standing here reminds me of the Christmas Play...
SK1004,703,The Miracle Bells"... I'll never forget that play for as long as I live.
SK1004,704,That reminds me, we even built a set for the Christmas play, huh...
SK1004,705,The guests seemed to like it, at least. What a relief.
SK1004,706,No one's in this library.
SK1004,707,Everyone must be busy getting ready for their trips right about now.
SK1004,708,Ginza's practically deserted now that it's the New Year holiday...
SK1004,709,All the stores are closed, and I'm sure a lot of people have left to visit their homes.
SK1004,710,Nobody's here.
SK1004,711,No use sticking around here. I'd better get dressed.
SK1004,712,It's empty. Nobody's here.
SK1004,713,No use staying around here. I'd better go.
SK1004,714,New Year's in Japan means playing games like sugoroku or fukuwarai...
SK1004,715,I should get the others to play during the break, if we have time.
SK1004,716,The second floor seats were also packed during the Christmas play.
SK1004,717,The guests all seemed to like it. I'm so glad.
SK1004,718,No reason anyone would be up in the attic during New Year's.
SK1004,719,All right, let's head somewhere else.
SK1004,720,I can smell roses from all the way out here...
SK1004,721,I wonder how the Rose Division is spending their New Year's holiday?
SK1004,722,Thanks to Kohran, the Tenbu are fully tuned up, even now in peacetime.
SK1004,723,If anything were to happen, we'd be ready to deploy immediately.
SK1004,724,I kind of feel like I'm losing my edge, what with not needing to deploy lately.
SK1004,725,Once the holiday's over, I'll come here and whip my body back into shape a little.
SK1004,726,I really don't like having to be here.
SK1004,727,I hope everyone in the Flower Division stays healthy this year.
SK1004,728,A cold-water swim isn't so bad in wintertime.
SK1004,729,No, wait, this pool's heated in the winter, isn't it?
SK1004,730,Who knows if we'll need to meet in the command room this year...
SK1004,731,I just hope this peace continues for as long as possible.
SK1004,732,The steam processor never stops working, even throughout the holidays.
SK1004,733,Still, what exactly is it processing, anyway?
SK1004,734,...I see. So you two'll be out for a while, then.
SK1004,735,Well, you've earned a nice vacation. Relax and take it easy.
SK1004,736,Yes, sir.
SK1004,737,Still, you remember what I said about keeping your romantic feelings in check, right?
SK1004,738,Y-Yes, sir...
SK1004,739,...Nah, it's fine. You guys did great work.
SK1004,740,You're the glue that keeps the Flower Division together.
SK1004,741,...
SK1004,742,Let me remind you two of something.
SK1004,743,What you feel for each other, your trust in one another... That's the source of the Flower Division's power.
SK1004,744,Mr. Yoneda...
SK1004,745,Headed out, you two?
SK1004,746,Kaede...
SK1004,747,You forgot this, Ogami.
SK1004,748,Ah! The Cinematron!
SK1004,749,You'd better make sure to take it with you while you're out, in case of emergency.
SK1004,750,R-Right. Understood, ma'am.
SK1004,751,Be careful, and have a fun New Year's holiday.
SK1004,752,Y-Yes, ma'am! We're off!
SK1004,753,Sorry, Ogami, but each customer is only allowed to purchase one photo at a time.
SK1004,754,I see. That's too bad.
SK1004,755,My apologies, Ogami, but each customer is only allowed to purchase one photo at a time.
SK1004,756,Oh, really? That's too bad.
SK1004,757,The jewel of the Pandemonium Regalia, entrusted to us by the Rose Division.
SK1004,758,Spirit Sword Arataka. The secret sword of the Shinguji family.
SK1004,759,Divine sword Shirahatori. Entrusted to me by Kaede. A secret sword passed down in the Fujieda family.
SK1004,760,Luminous blade Mukei. Shinnosuke Yamazaki is the original owner. A secret sword entrusted to us by Kazuma.
SK1004,761,Divine blade Mekkyaku. A secret sword entrusted to me by Yoneda.
SK1004,762,The uniform I wear at the theater. Good for both summer and winter.
SK1004,763,A lighter borrowed from the inn.
SK1004,764,The flower crown that Iris made for Reni.
SK1004,765,A plate used at the welcome party. I was asked to bring it to Sakura.
SK1004,766,A photo of Sakura.

SK1004,842,Listen to a rumor.
SK1004,843,I'll come back later.
SK1004,844,The Christmas play was so emotional!
SK1004,845,Your direction was exceptional, Ogami.
SK1004,846,Thank you. Somehow we managed to pull it off.
SK1004,847,And

SK1004,855,Reni
SK1004,856,was so beautiful in the lead...
SK1004,857,I'd love to get up on that stage too, even if only just once...
SK1004,858,The commotion caused by the coup d'état attempt last year has finally faded away.
SK1004,859,Yeah, people have stopped talking about the Taisho Restoration Army already.
SK1004,860,Maybe because it's the New Year and everyone wants to forget about the depressing news from last year?
SK1004,861,Yeah, that must be it.
SK1004,862,Have you had the chance to go for a New Year's shrine visit already, Ogami?
SK1004,863,Yeah. Are you two going?
SK1004,864,Yes, we thought we'd go with Kaede later...
SK1004,865,But Kaede seems so busy already, we don't know if she'll have the time.
SK1004,866,I see. I hope you all get to go together.
SK1004,867,Last year was quite hectic, wasn't it, Ogami? So much happened.
SK1004,868,Yeah, and it all happened so soon after I came back to the theater.
SK1004,869,Orihime and Reni have fully taken to being part of the Flower Division.
SK1004,870,It's all thanks to your efforts, Ogami.
SK1004,871,N-No, that's not true...
SK1004,872,I hope these peaceful days can last forever.
SK1004,873,Yep. If they don't, then we won't be able to go out to eat!
SK1004,874,Did you see today's newspaper, Ogami?
SK1004,875,No, not yet. Any interesting articles?
SK1004,876,Yes, there was a special article for New Year's, titled "The Capital of the Future."
SK1004,877,According to the article, in the near future, everyone will have their own steam automobiles...
SK1004,878,And every household will be equipped with steam telephones!
SK1004,879,Wow, really?
SK1004,880,Well, the article's just speculation.
SK1004,881,Heehee, there'd be daily flights to America or England...
SK1004,882,And television devices like Kohran's Cinematron would be commonplace!
SK1004,883,Hahaha, that all sounds like the far future to me.
SK1004,884,Is it true that residential applications for those apartments in Mukojima have opened up?
SK1004,885,Yes, and even though it won't be available for another six months, there's already a rush of applicants.
SK1004,886,Huh, these apartments must be pretty popular.
SK1004,887,They are the first western-style apartments in Japan, after all.
SK1004,888,Western-style?
SK1004,889,That's right. I think they also call them "flats."
SK1004,890,They're basically a bunch of rooms lined up next to each other, several stories tall...
SK1004,891,Hmm... I don't really know how to describe them.
SK1004,892,They're in Mukojima, right? I'll go take a look sometime.
SK1004,893,The Meiji Literature Collection's started publication as of last year, you know.
SK1004,894,Mr. Yoneda's arranged it so we always have the newest volume in the library, but they're too much for me.
SK1004,895,The print's way too small and I don't understand all the words...
SK1004,896,Really? I find many of them quite fascinating.
SK1004,897,I'll just stick with Harold Lloyd and Buster Keaton pictures, thanks.
SK1004,898,That reminds me, Ogami, New Year's Eve was pretty hectic, wasn't it?
SK1004,899,Yeah, we were really busy cleaning up and getting ready for the New Year.
SK1004,900,I still can't believe Kanna ate 50 bowls of toshikoshi soba.
SK1004,901,And Orihime caused quite a scene when she looked at the soba and said, "This pasta's gone bad!"
SK1004,902,What a lively way to end the year.
SK1004,903,Sorry, Ogami, but I'm all out of gossip for now.
SK1004,904,I'll have some more interesting tidbits for you another time, so look forward to it!
SK1004,905,All right, I'll come back later. Best of luck this year, you two.
SK1004,906,Thank you very much.
SK1004,907,I'll get you all kinds of juicy gossip this year!
SK1005,1,It's been a long time since you've been home, right, Sakura?
SK1005,2,Yes. I haven't been home ever since I left for Tokyo.
SK1005,3,My mother, grandmother, and their helper, Gonjii, live there.
SK1005,4,I wonder how they're doing...
SK1005,5,I'm feeling kind of nervous about meeting your family.
SK1005,6,You don't need to be so formal with them, Ogami.
SK1005,7,Well, that's easy enough for you to say, but...
SK1005,8,You two get along so well.
SK1005,9,Huh?
SK1005,10,Oh, excuse me.
SK1005,11,I was just watching you two being close with each other and that just slipped out.
SK1005,12,Are you visiting this young lady's home to announce your marriage or something?
SK1005,13,Well, something like that.
SK1005,14,N-No, that's not it.
SK1005,15,Well, something like that.
SK1005,16,O-Ogami!
SK1005,17,Ah, I knew it. That's exactly what I thought when I looked at you.
SK1005,18,Good luck, young man.
SK1005,19,Y-Yes.
SK1005,20,Sheesh, Ogami...
SK1005,21,N-No, that's not it. We're, uh, how do I put this...
SK1005,22,Th-That's right, we're not getting married or anything...
SK1005,23,Oh, is that so? I'm terribly sorry.
SK1005,24,In that case, are you running off in secret to elope?
SK1005,25,Th-That's not it at all, ma'am!
SK1005,26,(What kind of people does she think we are?!)
SK1005,27,U-Um, you see...
SK1005,28,Ah, I knew it. Youth is a wonderful thing.
SK1005,29,That being said, though, this isn't the kind of decision to make lightly.
SK1005,30,You should properly introduce yourself to the young lady's parents, for her sake as well as your own.
SK1005,31,Y-Yes.
SK1005,32,Sheesh, Ogami...
SK1005,33,That old lady totally thought that you and I were getting married.
SK1005,34,It's nice to ride the train like this every once in a while.
SK1005,35,It's been half a year since I've been home, when all that mess happened.
SK1005,36,Really? It's already been half a year since we broke into your house?
SK1005,37,We might've gone a little overboard at the time...
SK1005,38,That's true. In fact, if I were you, Ensign...
SK1005,39,I'd prepare to get an earful from Miyata, our butler.
SK1005,40,H-Hey, wait...
SK1005,41,It's all right, I'm not afraid.
SK1005,42,...I'm going home.
SK1005,43,H-Hey, wait... What if we get into another fight?
SK1005,44,Oh, Ensign, I'm only kidding.
SK1005,45,Miyata may be stubborn, but he's not unreasonable.
SK1005,46,Besides, that's all in the past now. I'm sure nobody minds anymore.
SK1005,47,Oh, I-I see...
SK1005,48,It's all right, I'm not afraid. I didn't do anything wrong.
SK1005,49,I see. As I expected, Ensign.
SK1005,50,I feel the same way. There's nothing for us to be ashamed of.
SK1005,51,We can walk through those gates with our heads held high.
SK1005,52,Yeah, sure.
SK1005,53,...I'm going home. I'm scared now.
SK1005,54,What are you so afraid of, Ensign?
SK1005,55,B-But...
SK1005,56,If you're confident about what you did, then there's no need to be upset.
SK1005,57,We should walk through those gates with our heads held high, right, Ensign?
SK1005,58,Y-Yeah. Got it.
SK1005,59,I see... I suppose that's possible.
SK1005,60,Oh, Ensign. I was merely joking.
SK1005,61,You need not worry, nobody in the Kanzaki estate would be so obstinate.
SK1005,62,Besides, we didn't do anything to be ashamed of.
SK1005,63,We can walk through those gates with our heads held high.
SK1005,64,I see. You're right.
SK1005,65,Count Hanakoji's estate is in Yokohama, right?
SK1005,66,Yes. We'll be there shortly if we take the train.
SK1005,67,I haven't visited the Count since last spring, when I left for America.
SK1005,68,Right, you were off in America.
SK1005,69,You lived in America a long time ago, too, right?
SK1005,70,...Yes. I found myself in America after defecting from Russia.
SK1005,71,Afterwards, I was scouted by the Imperial Assault Troupe and came to Japan.
SK1005,72,I'm used to greeting the New Year in foreign countries by now...
SK1005,73,Maria...
SK1005,74,Let's enjoy ourselves today.
SK1005,75,How do you like Japanese New Year?
SK1005,76,It's just us two this New Year's. Let's enjoy ourselves.
SK1005,77,...Yes, you're right. Thank you, Captain.
SK1005,78,How does the Japanese New Year stack up, from your point of view?
SK1005,79,It's quite enjoyable. Eating ozoni, visiting temples...
SK1005,80,But no matter which country you go to, New Year's is actually the same.
SK1005,81,The desire for the New Year to be a good one is the same no matter where in the world you are.
SK1005,82,I see...
SK1005,83,I'm sorry. I was rambling.
SK1005,84,No, it's fine.
SK1005,85,But getting to be alone with you, sir... I think this will be a great holiday.
SK1005,86,Yeah, I'm glad I can be with you, too.
SK1005,87,Let's have a great New Year, Maria.
SK1005,88,Yes, Captain.
SK1005,89,Woo! The ocean breeze feels great, doesn't it, Boss?
SK1005,90,Yeah, it does. It's a little cold, though.
SK1005,91,Unlike the capital, it's always hot in Okinawa, even in winter.
SK1005,92,Sorry for dragging you out all this way, though.
SK1005,93,It's all right.
SK1005,94,I had nothing better to do.
SK1005,95,It's all right. Besides, I wanted to spend the New Year with you anyway.
SK1005,96,Boss... Thanks.
SK1005,97,I think this is gonna be the best New Year's ever.
SK1005,98,Kanna...
SK1005,99,Eh, I had nothing better to do anyway.
SK1005,100,Oh, is that how it is, Boss?
SK1005,101,In that case, maybe you'd like swimming in the freezing ocean even more?
SK1005,102,Eep! I-I'll pass!
SK1005,103,Hahaha! Relax, I'm kidding.
SK1005,104,Right, let's get inside and have ourselves a snack, Boss.
SK1005,105,Huh? But we just had lunch.
SK1005,106,So what? Eating all sorts of foods is one of the best parts about traveling!
SK1005,107,C'mon, Boss, let's go already! Hurry!
SK1005,108,Hahaha, got it.
SK1005,109,At this rate, I'll be fat by the time we get to Okinawa...
SK1005,110,Eheheh! I'm so glad I get to go out with you, Mon Frère!
SK1005,111,Hahaha, are you really?
SK1005,112,Uh-huh! It's kinda like we're on a date!
SK1005,113,Hey, Mon Frère. Do you wanna... hold hands?
SK1005,114,Sure, why not?
SK1005,115,I'm kind of embarrassed...
SK1005,116,Sure, why not?
SK1005,117,Heheheh, thanks! I feel so happy...
SK1005,118,Don't let go of my hand until Papa and Mama's boat gets here, OK?
SK1005,119,OK, got it.
SK1005,120,There's so many people here... I feel kind of embarrassed.
SK1005,121,Jeez, way to spoil the mood, Mon Frère!
SK1005,122,B-But Iris... We can't just hold hands on the train...
SK1005,123,Whatever! You're such a wimp, Mon Frère!
SK1005,124,BLEHHH!
SK1005,125,(Oh boy, this date is quite the handful already...)
SK1005,126,Well, since you're being so quiet, Mon Frère...
SK1005,127,I'll just hold hands with you!
SK1005,128,H-Hey, Iris! Wait a second!
SK1005,129,It's all right, Mon Frère! After all, we're a couple!
SK1005,130,...Say, do you think those two are...?
SK1005,131,Good heavens, those youngsters are positively dazzling!
SK1005,132,Heheheh! We're the center of attention, Mon Frère!
SK1005,133,Hahaha... L-Looks like it...
SK1005,134,Ahh, an easygoing boat ride like this ain't so bad every once in a while.
SK1005,135,Haha... Well, I suppose you're right.
SK1005,136,Sorry for dragging you all the way out to Kobe, Chief.
SK1005,137,It's all right, I wanted to meet this Mr. Howard of yours anyway.
SK1005,138,Heheh... What kind of person do you think Mr. Howard is, Chief?
SK1005,139,He must love machines.
SK1005,140,He's probably very serious.
SK1005,141,He's probably really funny.
SK1005,142,He's a person who loves machines, right?
SK1005,143,Haha, that's right! He's something like a teacher to me, y'know!
SK1005,144,He's probably a very serious person...
SK1005,145,Nah, he's not serious in the least!
SK1005,146,He's getting up there in age, and he loves to mess with machines.
SK1005,147,Wow... He likes machinery just like you.
SK1005,148,Yep, that's right. He's something like a teacher to me, y'know!
SK1005,149,He's probably a really funny guy, huh?
SK1005,150,That's right! He loves inventing weird stuff to surprise people with.
SK1005,151,Hahaha, sounds kind of like you.
SK1005,152,Haha, well, he was my teacher, y'know.
SK1005,153,Hmm, I have no idea what kind of person he could be.
SK1005,154,He's a funny old guy who loves coming up with weird inventions to surprise people with.
SK1005,155,Well, to tell the truth, he's something like a teacher to me.
SK1005,156,Before I joined the Imperial Assault Troupe, I was staying with Mr. Howard in Kobe.
SK1005,157,He taught me a whole lot about machinery during that time.
SK1005,158,I had no idea...
SK1005,159,Well, if you wanna know more, you'll have to meet him to find out!
SK1005,160,By the way, Chief, you feeling hungry at all?
SK1005,161,Now that you mention it, I could go for something to eat.
SK1005,162,Heheh, that's why I brought candy, just for such an occasion!
SK1005,163,Good thinking as always, Kohran!
SK1005,164,Leave it to me! All right, let's head inside and eat some together.
SK1005,165,Hm hm... I still can't believe Mamma's coming to Japan.
SK1005,166,When I wrote to her about Papa, she came right over.
SK1005,167,She really must've wanted to see Mr. Ogata.
SK1005,168,By the way, Ensign, what kind of person do you think my Mamma is like?
SK1005,169,Beautiful, like you.
SK1005,170,Quiet, like you.
SK1005,171,Scary, like you.
SK1005,172,I imagine your mother is beautiful, just like you.
SK1005,173,Yeah, you get it! My Mamma's really pretty!
SK1005,174,I hope you're looking forward to meeting her!
SK1005,175,I imagine your mother is a quiet person, just like you.
SK1005,176,You shouldn't say something if you don't actually mean it, Ensign!
SK1005,177,I am not a "quiet person", if I do say so myself!
SK1005,178,R-Right. Sorry.
SK1005,179,I imagine your mother's scary, just like you.
SK1005,180,A-Am I really that scary?
SK1005,181,Hmm... Not lately, I guess.
SK1005,182,You used to be quite outspoken, though.
SK1005,183,C-Come on, now, that's ancient history.
SK1005,184,My mamma is very pretty, AND very nice!
SK1005,185,She won't get mad at you even if you make any mistakes, so just relax.
SK1005,186,Hmm... I have no idea what kind of person she could be.
SK1005,187,My mamma is just like me: elegant, kind...
SK1005,188,And most of all, beautiful!
SK1005,189,I hope you're looking forward to meeting her!
SK1005,190,Eeek!
SK1005,191,Whoa... Are you all right, Orihime?
SK1005,192,This is my first time riding the train here... It's so unstable!
SK1005,193,Hahaha, your first time, huh?
SK1005,194,Ensign, can I hold onto your arm so I don't fall over?
SK1005,195,Huh? You're not gonna use the handles?
SK1005,196,I'd rather use your arm.
SK1005,197,OK, grabbing your arm now!
SK1005,198,Hahaha, this is kind of embarrassing. But, eh, oh well.
SK1005,199,Are all these people also going to visit the shrine?
SK1005,200,This train is headed towards Meiji Shrine, so maybe.
SK1005,201,...
SK1005,202,Captain... Why did you invite me out?
SK1005,203,Because I wanted to go with you.
SK1005,204,Because you were alone.
SK1005,205,I just wanted to go with you. Is that not enough of a reason?
SK1005,206,No, it is... Lately I feel like I've come to understand that sort of feeling.
SK1005,207,I see...
SK1005,208,I just thought you might be lonely all by yourself.
SK1005,209,I wasn't particularly lonely. It's always been like that for me.
SK1005,210,But wouldn't you rather be with someone than all by yourself?
SK1005,211,...I won't deny that.
SK1005,212,Hmm... I dunno, I guess.
SK1005,213,I see... You didn't have a reason, then.
SK1005,214,Oh... S-Sorry, I didn't mean to offend you.
SK1005,215,No, it's fine.
SK1005,216,Oh, looks like we're almost there.
SK1005,217,Let's enjoy ourselves, all right, Reni?
SK1005,218,...Yeah.
SK1005,219,Well, we finally made it to Sendai.
SK1005,220,Everything outside of the station's covered in snow.
SK1005,221,But thank goodness the weather's nice and clear.
SK1005,222,All right, Ogami, let's get going to my home.
SK1005,223,Yeah, let's.
SK1005,224,Why don't we take a detour?
SK1005,225,Yeah, let's. I'm sure you want to be there as soon as possible.
SK1005,226,You're right. All right, let's go.
SK1005,227,Why don't we take a detour while we're here?
SK1005,228,Huh? A... detour?
SK1005,229,Yeah, do you know any interesting places nearby?
SK1005,230,Interesting places, huh? Let's see...
SK1005,231,Oh, I know. There is one place, but...
SK1005,232,It's not exactly a famous landmark of Sendai or anything. Is that all right?
SK1005,233,Huh, where is it?
SK1005,234,Heehee, you'll just have to wait and see.
SK1005,235,All right, Ogami, follow me.
SK1005,236,Is there something in these woods, Sakura?
SK1005,237,You see that big tree right in front, Ogami?
SK1005,238,Yeah, just the roots, though.
SK1005,239,Remember what I told you a long time ago?
SK1005,240,When I was little, I was climbing trees with my childhood friend, Takeshi...
SK1005,241,Lightning struck the tree Takeshi was on, and he got seriously hurt.
SK1005,242,Huh? So you mean this tree's...?
SK1005,243,Yes, this is the same tree the lightning struck.
SK1005,244,Huh? Is... Is that you, Sakura?
SK1005,245,Huh?
SK1005,246,I knew it, it IS you! Long time no see!
SK1005,247,...?
SK1005,248,What, have you forgotten about me? It's me, Takeshi! Takeshi Matsumoto!
SK1005,249,Huh?! Takeshi?! Takeshi, is that really you?! Wow, it's been ages!
SK1005,250,Are you here for the holiday?
SK1005,251,Classes are out for the New Year, so I came home.
SK1005,252,...Huh? Who's this, Sakura?
SK1005,253,Ah, this is Ichiro Ogami.
SK1005,254,He's been looking after me at the theater I work at in the capital.
SK1005,255,I see... Pleased to meet you, Ogami. My name is Takeshi Matsumoto.
SK1005,256,I'm Ichiro Ogami.
SK1005,257,Weren't you struck by lightning?
SK1005,258,I'm Ichiro Ogami.
SK1005,259,Weren't you struck by lightning?
SK1005,260,I'm Ichiro Ogami.
SK1005,261,I'd like to get to know you.
SK1005,262,Weren't you struck by lightning?
SK1005,263,Ichiro Ogami. Pleased to meet you.
SK1005,264,I'd rather say Sakura's the one who's been looking after me all this time.
SK1005,265,Haha, so formal! You sound like a soldier, Ogami.
SK1005,266,...
SK1005,267,...Um, oh yeah! What are you up to these days, Takeshi?
SK1005,268,Hey... Aren't you the guy who got struck by lightning when you were little?
SK1005,269,Hahaha! Sakura told you about that, did she?
SK1005,270,It was quite the mess back then, but I made it out alive.
SK1005,271,Now a Jizo statue's been placed here to prevent such an accident from ever happening again.
SK1005,272,I see...
SK1005,273,That reminds me, what are you up to these days, Takeshi?
SK1005,274,If you don't mind, I'd like to get to know you.
SK1005,275,O-Ogami! What's this all of a sudden?!
SK1005,276,Hahaha, you're a funny guy, Ogami!
SK1005,277,If you want to know more about me, then I'll gladly tell you.
SK1005,278,Come on, Ogami, say something.
SK1005,279,Oh, it's fine. I'm the one who interrupted you two, after all...
SK1005,280,Nowadays, I'm studying to become a doctor at Tohoku Imperial University's medical department.
SK1005,281,It's thanks to doctors that I managed to survive being struck by lightning.
SK1005,282,Ever since then, I've wanted to save lives for a living.
SK1005,283,I see... So you're a university student now.
SK1005,284,And I hear you're a famous actress in the capital, right?
SK1005,285,I'll be working hard to become a doctor, so let's both keep doing our best, OK?
SK1005,286,...Thanks, Takeshi.
SK1005,287,Well, looks like you've found yourself a nice guy, so I guess there's nothing for me to worry about, huh?
SK1005,288,Oh, stop it, Takeshi!
SK1005,289,Hahaha! Sorry, sorry.
SK1005,290,All right then, Ogami, if you'll excuse me.
SK1005,291,Sorry, Ogami. Takeshi's always been like that.
SK1005,292,It's all right, I don't mind.
SK1005,293,It's nice that you got to see each other again after so long.
SK1005,294,Yes. I'm glad that Takeshi seems to be doing well.
SK1005,295,All right, it's about time I showed you where my home is.
SK1005,296,When I was little, I was climbing trees with my childhood friend, Takeshi...
SK1005,297,Lightning struck the tree Takeshi was on, and he got seriously hurt.
SK1005,298,This is the very tree that got struck by lightning that day.
SK1005,299,Wow... So it was this tree, huh?
SK1005,300,Takeshi managed to survive somehow.
SK1005,301,But now there's a Jizo statue placed here to prevent such an accident from ever happening again.
SK1005,302,I had no idea...
SK1005,303,I've been afraid of lightning ever since...
SK1005,304,This place brings back those memories.
SK1005,305,I see. I suppose it is a landmark of sorts, for you.
SK1005,306,Thanks for showing me, Sakura.
SK1005,307,No, thank you for coming here with me.
SK1005,308,All right, let's get going to my house.
SK1005,309,Hmm, yeah, there's nowhere in particular I want to go, so let's just do that.
SK1005,310,OK. Right then, I'll show you the way.
SK1005,311,This is my home, Ogami.
SK1005,312,Wow... What a nice house.
SK1005,313,Heehee, it's just old, that's all. Come on in.
SK1005,314,Oh... Sakura.
SK1005,315,Ah, Mother. Happy New Year.
SK1005,316,Welcome home, Sakura.
SK1005,317,Happy New Year, Sakura. Now then, it's cold out, so please, come in...
SK1005,318,Umm, who might this be?
SK1005,319,This is Ichiro Ogami, captain of the Imperial Assault Troupe's Flower Division.
SK1005,320,Oh, welcome. I'm Wakana Shinguji, Sakura's mother.
SK1005,321,Pleased to meet you, I'm Ichiro Ogami.
SK1005,322,Pleased to meet you, Mom.
SK1005,323,Uh... P-Pleased to meet you...
SK1005,324,Pleased to meet you, Mom.
SK1005,325,Pleased to meet you, I'm Ichiro Ogami.
SK1005,326,Pleased to meet you, Mom. I'm Ichiro Ogami.
SK1005,327,O-Ogami! You can't just call her "Mom"!
SK1005,328,Straight to the point, isn't he, Sakura?
SK1005,329,Uh... P-Pleased to meet you! I'm Ichiro Ogami.
SK1005,330,I apologize for the late greeting.
SK1005,331,You can relax, Ogami.
SK1005,332,O-Ogami...
SK1005,333,Ah... S-Sorry for the late introduction. My name is Ichiro Ogami.
SK1005,334,Thank you for always being there for Sakura.
SK1005,335,Sakura always makes sure to write about you in her letters.
SK1005,336,M-Mother! You don't have to mention that...
SK1005,337,Now then, you must be tired from your long trip. Come in.
SK1005,338,OK. Pardon the intrusion, ma'am.
SK1005,339,You can use this room while you're staying here, Ogami.
SK1005,340,Would this happen to be...?
SK1005,341,...Yes. It was my father's room when he was still with us.
SK1005,342,His photo is above the desk...
SK1005,343,It's a photo from when he was transferred to the Anti-Kouma Corps.
SK1005,344,So this is Colonel Kazuma Shinguji...
SK1005,345,He looks like he has a strong sense of justice.
SK1005,346,He looks calm.
SK1005,347,He looks kind.
SK1005,348,He was a man with a strong sense of justice, wasn't he?
SK1005,349,Yes. He fought as a part of the Anti-Kouma Corps, the precursor to the Assault Troupe...
SK1005,350,In that sense, he's both my father and my superior officer. 
SK1005,351,He looks calm.
SK1005,352,Yes. I'd say he was a rather quiet man.
SK1005,353,He seems like a kind man.
SK1005,354,Yes. He was a valiant man with a strong sense of justice.
SK1005,355,He was always the kindest man in the room.
SK1005,356,This room's been like this ever since I left for the capital.
SK1005,357,We left everything just as it was, as though he were to come home at any minute.
SK1005,358,But my father... will never set foot in this room again.
SK1005,359,All that's left is this picture in his place...
SK1005,360,...
SK1005,361,But deep in my heart, the memory of my father lives on.
SK1005,362,The times he'd give me piggyback rides... How he taught me swordplay...
SK1005,363,Those memories are precious to me.
SK1005,364,Sakura...
SK1005,365,...Sorry, I've been rambling nonstop, haven't I?
SK1005,366,Right, Mother's waiting for us in the living room. Let's go, Ogami.
SK1005,367,OK, I got it.
SK1005,368,Allow me to reintroduce myself. My name is Wakana Shinguji.
SK1005,369,Thank you for looking after Sakura.
SK1005,370,N-Not at all, ma'am...
SK1005,371,You two have come a long way.
SK1005,372,Relax, and think of this home as your own.
SK1005,373,All right. Thank you for your hospitality.
SK1005,374,Mother, where's Grandmother?
SK1005,375,Your grandmother left with Gonjii to visit the hot springs.
SK1005,376,They'll likely be back in a day or two.
SK1005,377,All right, I'll introduce you then, Ogami.
SK1005,378,Yeah, sure.
SK1005,379,You two must be exhausted. I've already drawn a hot bath, so by all means, enjoy it before dinner.
SK1005,380,Sakura, could you bring Ogami your father's yukata?
SK1005,381,OK, understood!
SK1005,382,Here you go, Ogami. This belonged to my father, but please wear it.
SK1005,383,All right, I'll borrow it for now.
SK1005,384,I don't think that's a good idea.
SK1005,385,All right, I'll borrow it for now.
SK1005,386,Heehee... That yukata sure brings back memories, doesn't it, Mother?
SK1005,387,Yes, it truly does...
SK1005,388,I don't think that's a good idea. It was your father's... Wouldn't that make it a keepsake of his?
SK1005,389,It's all right, Ogami. I'm sure my father would want you to wear.
SK1005,390,She's right, Ogami. Now then, don't be shy.
SK1005,391,I see... All right, if you insist.
SK1005,392,Hmm...
SK1005,393,There's no need to hesitate, Ogami. Take it.
SK1005,394,I'm sure my father would be happy to see you wear it if he were here.
SK1005,395,...All right then, if you insist.
SK1005,396,How about trying it on to see if it fits?
SK1005,397,All right, sure.
SK1005,398,How's this?
SK1005,399,Wow... You almost look like my father... Right, Mother?
SK1005,400,Yes indeed. It suits you well, Ogami.
SK1005,401,Th-Thanks... Much obliged.
SK1005,402,All right, Sakura, could you show Ogami where the bathroom is?
SK1005,403,Also, if you could light the fire for the bath, while you're at it.
SK1005,404,OK, understood!
SK1005,405,Heehee, it's been so long since I've had to heat up a bath like this.
SK1005,406,OK, Ogami, let me show you where the bathroom is.
SK1005,407,OK, thanks.
SK1005,408,Phew, that felt great. It'd been ages since I took a wood-fired bath.
SK1005,409,Ogami? It's Wakana. May I come in?
SK1005,410,Y-Yes, ma'am! C-Come in.
SK1005,411,Pardon the intrusion.
SK1005,412,How was your bath? I know it isn't much, but we boil the water every day. 
SK1005,413,R-Right, Sakura lit the kindling for me, so the water was great.
SK1005,414,Sakura learned how from her grandmother, she's quite good at it.
SK1005,415,By the way, Ogami...
SK1005,416,Y-Yes.
SK1005,417,Sakura hasn't been causing any of you trouble, has she?
SK1005,418,Not at all.
SK1005,419,Now that you mention it...
SK1005,420,Not at all. She's been very helpful when it comes to cleaning and cooking...
SK1005,421,And she's passionate about her work on stage.
SK1005,422,I see... That's a relief.
SK1005,423,Now that you mention it... She IS always glaring at me...
SK1005,424,I'm so sorry. She can have a one-track mind at times.
SK1005,425,...I knew it, she has been causing you trouble after all.
SK1005,426,In any case, Sakura's always cheerful and hardworking.
SK1005,427,I see... Just knowing my daughter is living a happy life is a relief.
SK1005,428,...
SK1005,429,...Ogami, could you come out to the deck?
SK1005,430,Huh? OK...
SK1005,431,...
SK1005,432,...
SK1005,433,I feel like I've missed out on life. I got married, lived at home, raised a child... And that's it.
SK1005,434,As such, I'm a little jealous of Sakura...
SK1005,435,...
SK1005,436,*sigh* At any rate, being a parent can be boring.
SK1005,437,In the end, the children act like they grew up all on their own...
SK1005,438,Ogami, what do you fight the demons for?
SK1005,439,In my case...
SK1005,440,I fight for peace.
SK1005,441,I fight for the ones I love.
SK1005,442,Protecting the peace in the capital ensures everyone there can be happy.
SK1005,443,If I can help with that, even just a little bit, then I'm glad.
SK1005,444,And... so that no more lives may be lost in vain.
SK1005,445,I fight to protect the ones I love.
SK1005,446,I fight so that no precious lives will be lost fighting in vain.
SK1005,447,I fight... so that they may live.
SK1005,448,I... don't really know how to sum it up.
SK1005,449,...
SK1005,450,I'm sorry for asking such boring questions...
SK1005,451,Now then, keep warm and have a good night's sleep.
SK1005,452,Thank you.
SK1005,453,The owner of this room, Colonel Shinguji gave his life to protect the capital.
SK1005,454,But... was that really the right choice?
SK1005,455,Well, Ensign, we've made it.
SK1005,456,It's been a while since I've been here.
SK1005,457,Looks like they fixed the gate Kanna wrecked, too.
SK1005,458,Yes, even the mighty gate of Kanzaki estate is no match for Kanna's brute strength.
SK1005,459,Why didn't you stop her, anyway?
SK1005,460,No, I... Y-You're right. Sorry.
SK1005,461,You had a scrap with Miyata here, correct? I heard all about it afterward.
SK1005,462,I'm at your side today, so there's nothing for you to worry about. Now then, let's go in.
SK1005,463,Boy, this mansion never ceases to amaze me.
SK1005,464,Don't just stand there, Ensign, come along.
SK1005,465,Even on the inside it's huge...
SK1005,466,Everything's so big, my neck's starting to hurt from having to look up all the time.
SK1005,467,Oh, Ensign, you'll get lost if you keep gawking around like that.
SK1005,468,Oh, Mistress Sumire! Is that you?
SK1005,469,Hello, Miyata. How have you been?
SK1005,470,I have been fortunate enough to remain in perfect health.
SK1005,471,Now if you ever find yourself a suitor capable of being a proper husband...
SK1005,472,I, Kyosei Miyata, can pass on from this world with no regrets.
SK1005,473,Ohohoho, same as ever, I see, Miyata.
SK1005,474,I have brought a guest with me today.
SK1005,475,This is Ensign Ichiro Ogami. I trust you remember him, don't you?
SK1005,476,Ohh, Master Ogami! I must apologize for the trouble I caused you last time.
SK1005,477,No, I should apologize.
SK1005,478,You guys were tough.
SK1005,479,No, I should be the one to apologize. We did get pretty violent...
SK1005,480,Nonsense! You and the Flower Division were merely acting in Mistress Sumire's best interest.
SK1005,481,I was unable to properly recognize it at the time.
SK1005,482,What's more, the way you protected the manor afterward...
SK1005,483,Was more than enough to make up for your uncouth behavior.
SK1005,484,Even now I feel unbearable shame for the way I treated you!
SK1005,485,Come now, Miyata. The Ensign has forgiven you, too...
SK1005,486,So please, forget about what happened and treat the Ensign with your usual hospitality.
SK1005,487,Yes, my lady! I swear on my life!
SK1005,488,Man, you guys were tough. That was a hell of a fight.
SK1005,489,Forgive me, sir! I feel the utmost shame for my behavior!
SK1005,490,I was unable to recognize that you and the Flower Division only had Mistress Sumire's best interests at heart.
SK1005,491,And what's more, you fought valiantly to protect the manor. You have my gratitude.
SK1005,492,To think I would send our guards after you...
SK1005,493,Even now I feel unbearable shame for the way I treated you!
SK1005,494,Come now, Miyata. The Ensign has forgiven you, too...
SK1005,495,So please, forget about what happened and treat the Ensign with your usual hospitality.
SK1005,496,Yes, my lady! I swear on my life!
SK1005,497,Forgive me, sir! I feel the utmost shame for my behavior!
SK1005,498,You and the Flower Division were merely acting with Mistress Sumire's best interests at heart.
SK1005,499,I was unable to properly recognize it at the time.
SK1005,500,What's more, the way you protected the manor afterward...
SK1005,501,Was more than enough to make up for your uncouth behavior.
SK1005,502,Come now, Miyata, the Ensign understands already, there's no need for the passionate speech.
SK1005,503,By the way, Miyata, do you know where Grandfather and the others might be?
SK1005,504,W-Well...
SK1005,505,What's the matter? Take me to him, Miyata.
SK1005,506,...Very well. Right this way.
SK1005,507,He, Master Shigeki and Mistress Hinako are preoccupied with greeting guests for the New Year.
SK1005,508,You're right... Looks like a real handful.
SK1005,509,...
SK1005,510,M-My lady? Will that be all?
SK1005,511,Very well. I had a feeling this would happen.
SK1005,512,Right then, Ensign. Let's make our way to my room.
SK1005,513,Miyata, if you could tell my father and the others that we've arrived.
SK1005,514,Y-Yes, my lady. Understood.
SK1005,515,Now then, Ensign, allow me to show you my room.
SK1005,516,Here we are. Please, come in.
SK1005,517,Wow, so this is your room...
SK1005,518,It's just as I left it when I left to join the Imperial Assault Troupe.
SK1005,519,What a nice, cheery room.
SK1005,520,It's more plain than your room at the theater.
SK1005,521,...Is that a stuffed animal?
SK1005,522,What a nice, cheery room.
SK1005,523,Ohohoho... You honor me with your compliments, Ensign.
SK1005,524,It's a bit more plain than your room at the theater, isn't it?
SK1005,525,Yes, my room at the theater is decorated just the way I like it.
SK1005,526,Hahaha, I see.
SK1005,527,...Huh? Is that a stuffed animal I see?
SK1005,528,I-I told you this was my childhood room, didn't I?!
SK1005,529,Even I had stuffed animals when I was a child!
SK1005,530,You don't have to get so mad. I think it's kind of cute.
SK1005,531,So even you doted on stuffed animals when you were young...
SK1005,532,Goodness, you're impressed by the strangest things.
SK1005,533,...Ensign, give me your honest impression, won't you?
SK1005,534,Oh, uh, right. It's... nice?
SK1005,535,Ugh! That's hardly what I'd call an impression!
SK1005,536,A proper gentleman must come up with a tasteful remark at a time like this!
SK1005,537,R-Right...
SK1005,538,Now then, Ensign, how about some tea?
SK1005,539,Wait just a moment while I boil some water for us.
SK1005,540,Sure. Thanks.
SK1005,541,I'll put the Cinematron right here. Now please, make yourself at home.
SK1005,542,Huh... So this is the room Sumire stayed in when she was little...
SK1005,543,Hm? There's a stack of papers here.
SK1005,544,Looks like there's all kinds of things written on them.
SK1005,545,Give them a read.
SK1005,546,Now I'm curious. Maybe I'll read just a little bit.
SK1005,547,Dear Ensign, how has the past year treated you?"
SK1005,548,So long as I'm writing this letter, I should keep you abreast of my present situation."
SK1005,549,I have been... arranged to be wed."
SK1005,550,Th-This is... a letter to me.
SK1005,551,As I write this, you're at sea, on the other side of the world."
SK1005,552,I await your return, alone, as the isolation tears me apart."
SK1005,553,Wait... Are all of these letters to me?!
SK1005,554,Sorry to keep you waiting, Ensign. The tea's...
SK1005,555,Ah! A-Are those...?
SK1005,556,Ah... W-Well, uh...
SK1005,557,E-Ensign! Don't read people's letters without asking!
SK1005,558,S-Sorry! I saw and them and got the urge to...
SK1005,559,For goodness' sake! After I made you some tea, no less!
SK1005,560,As punishment, you're going to drink this freshly-boiled, piping-hot water!
SK1005,561,Eep! Th-That's going a little too far, Sumire!
SK1005,562,(Sheesh... Don't do anything you wouldn't want to get caught doing, I guess.)
SK1005,563,No, I shouldn't. I can't just snoop around people's rooms on a whim.
SK1005,564,Sorry to keep you waiting, Ensign. The tea's ready.
SK1005,565,Ah... O-OK!
SK1005,566,(Good thing I didn't read them, or else she definitely would've caught me.)
SK1005,567,(Still... I can't help but wonder what's written on them.)
SK1005,568,Ensign? Is something the matter?
SK1005,569,N-Nope, nothing at all! Now then, let's enjoy this tea!
SK1005,570,...Delicious! That was some excellent tea, Sumire.
SK1005,571,Naturally. I did my utmost best when making this tea.
SK1005,572,Anyway, I wonder if your parents are still busy receiving guests...
SK1005,573,It's always been like this. They're always busy, even during New Year's.
SK1005,574,They might even make us wait until evening.
SK1005,575,Hmm... I see...
SK1005,576,...
SK1005,577,I know! I just had the most wonderful idea!
SK1005,578,Oh? What is it, Sumire?
SK1005,579,I'll cook something for you, Ensign!
SK1005,580,Huh?! Did you say... cook?!
SK1005,581,Yes. I'll do my utmost best to make something for you.
SK1005,582,I don't think that's a good idea.
SK1005,583,Can't wait to try it!
SK1005,584,I don't think that's such a good idea. I mean, have you ever even cooked before?
SK1005,585,Well now! That's quite rude to say that before I've even been given a chance!
SK1005,586,I don't need experience! Cooking is all about intuition!
SK1005,587,R-Right...
SK1005,588,Just wait in the hall and let me take care of it.
SK1005,589,Sumire's cooking, huh? Hmm...
SK1005,590,Well, I certainly am interested in how it'll turn out.
SK1005,591,Right, I'll go ahead and wait in the hall, then.
SK1005,592,I can't wait to try your cooking!
SK1005,593,Ohohohoho, I figured as much.
SK1005,594,With my natural intuition and talent, I'll make you a meal beyond compare!
SK1005,595,Now then, Ensign, if you could wait in the hall until I'm finished cooking.
SK1005,596,It's not every day I get the chance to try Sumire's cooking.
SK1005,597,OK, I'll go ahead and wait in the hall.
SK1005,598,Now then, Ensign, if you could wait in the hall until I'm finished cooking.
SK1005,599,Soon you shall behold the cooking born from my boundless talent and intuition!
SK1005,600,Hmm... I wonder what kind of dish it'll be.
SK1005,601,Guess I ought to wait in the hall for now.
SK1005,602,It's almost been an hour... I can't wait to try Sumire's homemade cooking.
SK1005,603,Apologies for the wait, Ensign!
SK1005,604,I have finally completed my special dish!
SK1005,605,Really? I can't wait to see what it is!
SK1005,606,Um... This is my first time cooking, so...
SK1005,607,I'm not terribly confident, but if you enjoy it, then I'll be glad.
SK1005,608,I'm just happy to be able to eat something you made yourself, Sumire.
SK1005,609,Ensign...
SK1005,610,Right, let me bring you your food!
SK1005,611,Bon appétit!
SK1005,612,Ahhh! That's... That's an impressive dish!
SK1005,613,I started with the staples of gourmet dining and used foie gras, caviar, and truffles as a base.
SK1005,614,Then I seasoned it with soy sauce to add some Japanese flavor.
SK1005,615,Since I figured you were tired from the trip, I also enriched it with a little salt...
SK1005,616,And I added just a pinch of sugar as a secret ingredient in my special, all-natural butter sauce.
SK1005,617,You're always exhausted from work, so I poured my heart into making a meal that's sure to revitalize you.
SK1005,618,I... I see. Thank you, Sumire.
SK1005,619,Now then, please, help yourself.
SK1005,620,D-Down the hatch!
SK1005,621,(Th-This flavor... Words can't even begin to describe it...)
SK1005,622,Well, Ensign? How does it taste?
SK1005,623,I'm not a fan...
SK1005,624,It has a unique flavor.
SK1005,625,I'm not a fan...
SK1005,626,It has a unique flavor.
SK1005,627,D-Delicious!
SK1005,628,I'm not a fan...
SK1005,629,Oh, Ensign, you're such a picky eater.
SK1005,630,All right then, try the caviar and soy sauce stir fry.
SK1005,631,I've never tasted anything like this before! I-It's unbelievable!
SK1005,632,Ohohoho... How typical of you to hide your embarrassment.
SK1005,633,But if you enjoy it, simply say so. There's nothing to be ashamed of.
SK1005,634,Y-You're right. Ha... Hahaha.
SK1005,635,Um, how should I put this... It has a... unique flavor.
SK1005,636,Ohohoho... Yes, only I could be capable of such an exquisite flavor.
SK1005,637,Y-You might be right.
SK1005,638,D-Delicious! This flavor is unspeakable... Unspeakably good!
SK1005,639,...I'm a little concerned it took you so long to answer.
SK1005,640,N-No, I was just savoring the flavor!
SK1005,641,Oh, Ensign. You flatter me.
SK1005,642,Ah, it's so delicious that words fail you, isn't it!
SK1005,643,Well don't mind me, take your time and enjoy it.
SK1005,644,Aren't... Aren't you going to have some, Sumire?
SK1005,645,I'm more than satisfied with just watching you, Ensign.
SK1005,646,Sumire...
SK1005,647,Oh, don't mind me, please keep eating. There's plenty left for you to enjoy.
SK1005,648,I... I see! Glad to hear it! Hahaha...
SK1005,649,Oh, Sumire. Welcome home.
SK1005,650,(Hm? Was that...?)
SK1005,651,Welcome home, Sumire. Sorry we were so preoccupied with our guests.
SK1005,652,It's been like this ever since I was a child. I'm used to it.
SK1005,653,I truly am sorry, Sumire. After you came all this way...
SK1005,654,Oh, and you brought your boyfriend with you.
SK1005,655,H-Hello.
SK1005,656,I'm Shigeki Kanzaki... Sumire's father. Thank you for looking after her.
SK1005,657,I'm Hinako. Charmed.
SK1005,658,Thanks for having me.
SK1005,659,Sorry about last time.
SK1005,660,Hello. Thank you for having me.
SK1005,661,My, you're a handsome one, aren't you? Please, make yourself at home.
SK1005,662,All right. Thank you, ma'am.
SK1005,663,I'm terribly sorry about last time.
SK1005,664,Last time? Oh, not at all, I'd already forgotten about it.
SK1005,665,Please, make yourself at home.
SK1005,666,Yes, ma'am. Much obliged.
SK1005,667,Oh, there's no need to be so nervous.
SK1005,668,Just relax and make yourself at home.
SK1005,669,Yes, ma'am. Much obliged.
SK1005,670,Hm? What's this food?
SK1005,671,Oh, this is Sumire's, she made it all by herself.
SK1005,672,What?! Sumire cooked for you?!
SK1005,673,Sumire's almost never set foot in a kitchen before, and now she's cooking?
SK1005,674,Yes, I cook. I'm capable of that much, at least.
SK1005,675,Right, Ensign, allow me to clean up for you.
SK1005,676,Thanks, Sumire. The food was delicious.
SK1005,677,We still have some matters to attend to, so if you'll excuse us.
SK1005,678,Let's talk some more later, Ogami.
SK1005,679,Yes, ma'am. Thank you very much.
SK1005,680,Sumire's parents... That was a little nerve-racking.
SK1005,681,Sorry to disturb you, Ogami.
SK1005,682,(Th-That voice!)
SK1005,683,It's been a while. I'm Tadayoshi, Sumire's grandfather. You remember me, don't you?
SK1005,684,Y-Yes.
SK1005,685,...So, how is the Imperial Assault Troupe these days?
SK1005,686,You don't regret taking Sumire with you at the expense of my financial support, do you?
SK1005,687,Not at all.
SK1005,688,A little.
SK1005,689,I don't regret it at all, sir. Sumire's a valuable member of the team.
SK1005,690,Fwohoho... Enthusiastic as ever.
SK1005,691,Keep up the hard work, then, so that you won't have to come crawling back to me later.
SK1005,692,Yes, sir!
SK1005,693,Well... I do regret it a little bit.
SK1005,694,Fwohoho... Aren't we honest?
SK1005,695,But a man never goes back on his word. You must take responsibility for your choices.
SK1005,696,I will.
SK1005,697,Hmm... That's a tough question.
SK1005,698,Fwohoho... What happened to all that enthusiasm from before?
SK1005,699,A man never goes back on his word. You must stay true to your beliefs and never falter.
SK1005,700,...Yes, sir.
SK1005,701,Now then, I'll be taking my leave. Give Sumire my regards.
SK1005,702,Huh? You're not going to see her yourself?
SK1005,703,Sumire left us. I have no intention of seeing her.
SK1005,704,Now, if you'll excuse me.
SK1005,705,...
SK1005,706,Wow... So this is Count Hanakoji's estate.
SK1005,707,Hello, Count Hanakoji. Are you home?
SK1005,708,That voice... Maria, is that you? And is that Ogami with you?
SK1005,709,Welcome. I've been waiting for you two.
SK1005,710,Apologies for not keeping in touch, sir. Thank you for all your help with the troupe.
SK1005,711,Hahaha... You're the only man fit to lead the Flower Division, Ogami.
SK1005,712,You two have come a long way. Please, come in.
SK1005,713,All right. Pardon the intrusion.
SK1005,714,I see, so Yoneda's also doing well. Very good, very good.
SK1005,715,By the way, Maria, thank you for accompanying me to America earlier.
SK1005,716,Don't mention it, sir. I was glad to go back after so long.
SK1005,717,You were a great help while we were there. Again, allow me to express my thanks.
SK1005,718,By the way, I recall you were looking for something at the jeweler's back then. Did you ever find it?
SK1005,719,You visited so many jewelry stores, so I figured...
SK1005,720,C-Count Hanakoji! Please don't say that in front of the captain!
SK1005,721,Oops, forgive me, I forgot I wasn't supposed to talk about that. Hahaha...
SK1005,722,Huh?
SK1005,723,Talk to Maria.
SK1005,724,Talk to Hanakoji.
SK1005,725,Maria... What were you looking for at the jewelry stores?
SK1005,726,N-Nothing. Nothing at all.
SK1005,727,Oh, Count Hanakoji, look what you did.
SK1005,728,I really am sorry. It just slipped out.
SK1005,729,What exactly was Maria looking for, Count Hanakoji?
SK1005,730,Well, I honestly don't know.
SK1005,731,All I know is she was quite serious about visiting as many jewelers as she could.
SK1005,732,...That's enough of that talk, you two.
SK1005,733,(Hmm... Now I'm really curious.)
SK1005,734,Never mind that, Captain, it's nothing important. It's a personal matter.
SK1005,735,I see... Still, now you've got me curious.
SK1005,736,Anyway, I'm glad you two came all this way to see me...
SK1005,737,But my family never really observed New Year's, so I'm not doing anything particular to celebrate.
SK1005,738,I realize it must be quite dull for you to stay here, so why don't you two have yourselves a nice date instead?
SK1005,739,All right, we will.
SK1005,740,Huh?! W-We're not...
SK1005,741,All right, we will.
SK1005,742,So you only want to go on a date because you're bored, is that it, Captain?!
SK1005,743,For what it's worth, I think you two make a lovely couple. Now, go on and have fun.
SK1005,744,Oh, for goodness' sake! Please don't tease us, sir.
SK1005,745,Huh?! W-We're not... We can't just go on a date...
SK1005,746,Well, it is New Year's, after all. Maybe a date wouldn't be so bad for a change.
SK1005,747,All right then, have fun, you two.
SK1005,748,Yes, sir...
SK1005,749,You don't have to think about it so hard. We're just going out together, that's all.
SK1005,750,Going out together is what you'd call a "date", though, isn't it?
SK1005,751,Oh, for goodness' sake! Please don't tease us, sir.
SK1005,752,OK, where should we go, Maria?
SK1005,753,I think I might have mentioned it to you before, Captain...
SK1005,754,But I know a great café bar here in Yokohama.
SK1005,755,Captain, I know a great café bar here in Yokohama.
SK1005,756,If it's all right with you, why don't we stop by?
SK1005,757,Sure, let's check it out.
SK1005,758,I dunno, sounds fancy...
SK1005,759,Sure, let's check it out. Might as well while we're in Yokohama.
SK1005,760,Really? Then I'll take you there.
SK1005,761,A café bar, huh? I dunno, sounds fancy...
SK1005,762,It's all right, Captain. It's a quiet place, ideal for relaxing.
SK1005,763,We might as well go while we're in Yokohama.
SK1005,764,You're right. OK, let's go.
SK1005,765,Hmm... What to do...
SK1005,766,Captain, why don't we stop by while we're already in Yokohama?
SK1005,767,Yeah, you're right. Let's check it out.
SK1005,768,I want to see what kind of place this old haunt of yours is, anyway.
SK1005,769,Thank you. Now then, I'll show you the way.
SK1005,770,All right, we're here. This is the café bar, Captain.
SK1005,771,Wow, this place looks fancy.
SK1005,772,Let's head inside.
SK1005,773,What a relaxed atmosphere. Figures you'd like hanging out here.
SK1005,774,You think so? I'm glad you like it.
SK1005,775,Talk about Maria.
SK1005,776,Talk about Hanakoji.
SK1005,777,Talk about Maria.
SK1005,778,Talk about Hanakoji.
SK1005,779,Talk about the jewelers.
SK1005,780,Talk about Maria.
SK1005,781,Talk about the jewelers.
SK1005,782,Talk about Hanakoji.
SK1005,783,Talk about the jewelers.
SK1005,784,Talk about Maria.
SK1005,785,Talk about Hanakoji.
SK1005,786,Talk about the jewelers.
SK1005,787,It's been so long since we've been able to go out together like this.
SK1005,788,You're right. I've been thinking of bringing you here for a while, now, too.
SK1005,789,This peace may be fleeting, but I want to cherish it while it lasts.
SK1005,790,Yeah, sure.
SK1005,791,Being here with you truly makes me happy, Captain.
SK1005,792,Well at any rate, Count Hanakoji's a funny guy.
SK1005,793,Yes, being one of Mr. Yoneda's old friends, it makes sense he'd be quite the joker.
SK1005,794,But he's always thinking about world peace and he's always caring for the troupe. He's a reliable ally.
SK1005,795,Now that I think about it, we really ought to express our gratitude to him.
SK1005,796,That reminds me, what exactly were you looking for at those jewelry stores?
SK1005,797,...
SK1005,798,I thought you might ask. Seems like I don't have a choice but to tell you.
SK1005,799,What's this all of a sudden, Captain?
SK1005,800,S-Sorry, it's just, it's been bugging me for a while now...
SK1005,801,I was hoping we could talk about other things, but oh well.
SK1005,802,What I was looking for was... this locket.
SK1005,803,I used to have another locket, but...
SK1005,804,Captain... You remember, right? Well, I went to his grave...
SK1005,805,And parted with that locket.
SK1005,806,But I realized I needed to get a new locket, no matter what.
SK1005,807,In order to support myself...
SK1005,808,Maria...
SK1005,809,...I'm sorry.
SK1005,810,Could you show me the inside?
SK1005,811,...I'm sorry. I didn't mean to bring up such a sore subject.
SK1005,812,It's all right. I feel relieved having talked about it.
SK1005,813,It can be hard, shouldering your life on only your own shoulders.
SK1005,814,Maria...
SK1005,815,If it's all right... Could you show me the inside of the locket?
SK1005,816,I'm afraid not. It's a secret, and mine alone.
SK1005,817,Hmmm... Now I'm curious.
SK1005,818,Hm hm hm... Whoever could it be?
SK1005,819,...
SK1005,820,That's enough about my locket.
SK1005,821,Right then, Captain, where should we go after this?
SK1005,822,Let's see... Well, where would you like to go, Maria?
SK1005,823,Well... Let's visit the port!
SK1005,824,I see, Yokohama's a port town, after all.
SK1005,825,All right, let's get going.
SK1005,826,No lollygagging, Captain! Hurry!
SK1005,827,(Maria's leading me all over the place today, isn't she?)
SK1005,828,We're here, Boss! We finally made it to Okinawa!
SK1005,829,Yeah. The sea, the sky... It's all so beautiful.
SK1005,830,Remember how you came to Okinawa with me two years ago?
SK1005,831,We never got to stop by my home island back then.
SK1005,832,We were there to train, so I was hauling a ton of equipment, too.
SK1005,833,All right, Boss, lemme show you my house.
SK1005,834,It's just a short walk from here. All right, let's go.
SK1005,835,Here we are, Boss. This here's my house.
SK1005,836,Wow, the walls are made of stone.
SK1005,837,Yep, most Okinawan houses are like that.
SK1005,838,Anyway, let's head inside for now.
SK1005,839,Phew... There really is no place like home!
SK1005,840,You lived here when you were little, right?
SK1005,841,You could say that, but all I ever did was train in karate.
SK1005,842,The building over there's a dojo now.
SK1005,843,My dad and I would spar out in this garden all the time, too.
SK1005,844,Does... nobody else live here anymore?
SK1005,845,Yeah. After my dad passed, I lived here on my own for a while.
SK1005,846,Ever since I joined the troupe, I come here every once in a while to keep the place clean.
SK1005,847,That sounds rough.
SK1005,848,Does that make you lonely?
SK1005,849,That sounds rough. Isn't it hard, cleaning a place this big?
SK1005,850,Nahhh, it's nothin'. Makes for good exercise.
SK1005,851,Gotta take good care of your home, right?
SK1005,852,Kanna...
SK1005,853,So when you come back, there's nobody else here. Does that make you lonely?
SK1005,854,...To be honest, sometimes, yeah.
SK1005,855,Whenever that happens, I go in the dojo over there and train until I tire myself out.
SK1005,856,Doing that distracts me from the loneliness a little.
SK1005,857,But I'm fine now. I mean, you're here with me, right?
SK1005,858,Hahaha, I'm glad to hear you say that.
SK1005,859,Since ancient times, people in Okinawa have believed in goddesses known as "Unai."
SK1005,860,It's said that Unai protect the men most precious to them.
SK1005,861,Huh...
SK1005,862,I couldn't do anything for my dad.
SK1005,863,I... wasn't able to be his Unai.
SK1005,864,But at the very least, I can protect this house and his grave.
SK1005,865,Kanna...
SK1005,866,Heheh, sorry, I was being kind of a downer, there.
SK1005,867,Heh, all right, Boss, while you're listening to my story, could you come with me for a sec?
SK1005,868,Huh? Where to?
SK1005,869,To my dad's grave. C'mon, let's go.
SK1005,870,Ah, there it is... My dad's grave.
SK1005,871,Wow, Okinawan graves sure look different.
SK1005,872,It's called a kaaminakuu tomb. Shaped like a woman's spread legs, so the dead can return to where they came from.
SK1005,873,Th-That's fascinating...
SK1005,874,Yeah. It's a totally different way of thinking compared to the Japanese.
SK1005,875,Hey Dad, I'm home! Back for the first time in ages.
SK1005,876,I brought my boss with me today, y'know, the one I told you about before.
SK1005,877,If ya don't mind, Boss, could you offer up a word or two to my dad's grave?
SK1005,878,A word, huh...
SK1005,879,I'm Ichiro Ogami.
SK1005,880,Your daughter's so strong.
SK1005,881,I'm Ichiro Ogami, captain of the Imperial Assault Troupe's Flower Division.
SK1005,882,Ms. Kanna's always been there to lend us her strength.
SK1005,883,Hahaha, so it's "Ms. Kanna" now, huh? So polite, as always.
SK1005,884,Thanks, Boss. I'm sure my dad's happy to have met you, too.
SK1005,885,Your daughter's so strong. We spar all the time, and she beats the tar out of me.
SK1005,886,B-Boss! You don't have to be so open about that stuff!
SK1005,887,I figured it'd be best to let him know how things always are between us.
SK1005,888,Hmm... Eh, all right.
SK1005,889,The words just aren't coming to me.
SK1005,890,It's all right, Boss, you don't need to say anything. You being here is enough.
SK1005,891,Here, Dad. I brought you awamori, your favorite. Drink up.
SK1005,892,I also brought a bunch of your favorite food, like rafute and mimiga.
SK1005,893,Hey, Dad... My Boss is cool, right? Looks tough, right?
SK1005,894,On top of that, though... He's really nice. He's someone you can really rely on.
SK1005,895,It's like you always said, Dad. You can't only have a strong body, you need a strong heart as well.
SK1005,896,I'll keep working hard so I'm as strong as you... and my Boss.
SK1005,897,Kanna...
SK1005,898,All right, Boss, how's about you and I have a drinking contest while we're here?
SK1005,899,Huh?! Here?!
SK1005,900,We drink and we sing. It's the Okinawan way. It'll make Dad happy, too.
SK1005,901,Really...? All right! Got it.
SK1005,902,OK, here's some awamori! Let's get our drink on!
SK1005,903,All right, let's party!
SK1005,904,I can't hold my liquor...
SK1005,905,All right, while we're here, we might as well party!
SK1005,906,That's what I'm talkin' about! You're always up for anything, Boss!
SK1005,907,I can't really hold my liquor...
SK1005,908,All right, eat, then! Pig out!
SK1005,909,Yeah... All right, I'll do that, then.
SK1005,910,C'mon, don't be such a party pooper! Drink and have fun, Boss!
SK1005,911,Yeah... All right, I'll do that, then.
SK1005,912,Eat up, Boss!
SK1005,913,Yeah, sure. Man, Okinawan food goes really well with awamori.
SK1005,914,Heh, I know, right? It's even better under an Okinawan sky like this, too.
SK1005,915,Man, the food's great, and I got my Boss here by my side! This is the best!
SK1005,916,Don't mind us, Dad, we're just gonna do our own thing!
SK1005,917,Kanna...
SK1005,918,It's fine! He's the one who just had to go and die...
SK1005,919,All right, we still got plenty of time! Time to party!
SK1005,920,It's here! Mon Frère, Papa and Mama are in that boat!
SK1005,921,Wow... That ship is huge.
SK1005,922,C'mon, Mon Frère, let's go! Hurry!
SK1005,923,Hahaha, OK, OK.
SK1005,924,Yaaay! Papaaaa! Mamaaaa!
SK1005,925,Iris?
SK1005,926,Ohh, Iris!
SK1005,927,Papa, Mama! I'm so happy you're here!
SK1005,928,We can have lunch together and talk about all sorts of stuff!
SK1005,929,Y-Yes...
SK1005,930,...Yes, let's do that, Iris.
SK1005,931,Teehee! Heheh, I can't wait!
SK1005,932,Papa, Mama, this is Mon Frère.
SK1005,933,I'm Ichiro Ogami. Pleased to meet you.
SK1005,934,It's been a long time. Thank you for your hospitality back when I went to France.
SK1005,935,It's been a long time, so let me introduce you again!
SK1005,936,This is my papa and mama!
SK1005,937,I'm Robert, Iris's father. Thank you for always looking after her.
SK1005,938,You may call me Marguerite. I'm Iris's mother.
SK1005,939,Iris has told us so much about you in her letters.
SK1005,940,Eheheh! Mama's really pretty, isn't she?
SK1005,941,You have a beautiful mother.
SK1005,942,You're her spitting image.
SK1005,943,You're beautiful, too.
SK1005,944,You have a beautiful mother.
SK1005,945,Right? Right?
SK1005,946,When I grow up, I'm gonna be pretty just like her!
SK1005,947,Oh, Iris...
SK1005,948,Hahaha, I can't wait.
SK1005,949,She looks a lot like you, I was surprised.
SK1005,950,You're her spitting image, Iris.
SK1005,951,Uh-huh! I'm her child, after all!
SK1005,952,When I grow up, I'm gonna be pretty just like her!
SK1005,953,Oh, Iris...
SK1005,954,Hahaha, I can't wait.
SK1005,955,Your mother's beautiful, but so are you, Iris.
SK1005,956,Huh? Really?
SK1005,957,Yaaay! Mon Frère said I'm beautiful!
SK1005,958,Oh, Iris...
SK1005,959,Hahaha...
SK1005,960,(She... She sure is beautiful...)
SK1005,961,Ah! Mon Frère, you're blushiiiing!
SK1005,962,I'm gonna be just as pretty when I grow up, so just wait, OK?
SK1005,963,Oh, Iris...
SK1005,964,Hahaha, thank you Iris.
SK1005,965,Come on, Mon Frère, Papa, Mama, let's go inside.
SK1005,966,You're right. After you, Ogami.
SK1005,967,All right. Pardon me.
SK1005,968,And then, and then! Guess what Mon Frère did?
SK1005,969,I-Iris!
SK1005,970,Hmhmhm, oh, Iris, you've done nothing but talk about Ogami this whole time.
SK1005,971,R-Really? Heheh...
SK1005,972,Whatever will we do with you?
SK1005,973,Speaking of which, we received that letter from you and Iris a while ago, Ogami.
SK1005,974,That's right. It made us very happy.
SK1005,975,Do you remember how you described yourself?
SK1005,976,As captain of the Flower Division... right?
SK1005,977,As a ticket puncher... right?
SK1005,978,As Iris's lover... right?
SK1005,979,As captain of the Flower Division... right?
SK1005,980,Hmhm, sounds like you've already forgotten.
SK1005,981,You wrote that you were a ticket puncher, if I recall.
SK1005,982,Ah, now that you mention it, that might've been it.
SK1005,983,Hmhm, sounds like you've already forgotten.
SK1005,984,You rather boldly claimed to be Iris's "lover", but I wonder if that's common in Japan...
SK1005,985,...Huh? W-Was that it?
SK1005,986,Ah... S-Sorry. That was rather brazen of me.
SK1005,987,Yes, that's right, you remembered.
SK1005,988,We wrote it together, after all, remember?
SK1005,989,That letter truly reflected your serious personality, Ogami.
SK1005,990,As the theater's ticket puncher... right?
SK1005,991,Hmhm, sounds like you've already forgotten.
SK1005,992,You wrote that you were captain of the Flower Division, if I recall.
SK1005,993,Ah, now that you mention it, that might've been it.
SK1005,994,Yes, that's right, you remembered.
SK1005,995,We wrote it together, after all, remember?
SK1005,996,That letter truly reflected your unique personality, Ogami.
SK1005,997,As Iris's lover... right?
SK1005,998,Yes, that's right, you remembered.
SK1005,999,You can't forget something that important!
SK1005,1000,That letter truly reflected your passionate personality, Ogami.
SK1005,1001,Hmm... I forgot.
SK1005,1002,Huh?! You already forgot, Mon Frère?!
SK1005,1003,Now, now, Iris, it was quite some time ago.
SK1005,1004,You wrote that you were a ticket puncher, if I recall.
SK1005,1005,W-Was that it?
SK1005,1006,That letter truly reflected your unique personality, Ogami.
SK1005,1007,You wrote that you were captain of the Flower Division, if I recall.
SK1005,1008,W-Was that it?
SK1005,1009,That letter truly reflected your serious personality, Ogami.
SK1005,1010,You rather boldly claimed to be Iris's "lover", but I wonder if that's common in Japan...
SK1005,1011,...Huh? W-Was that it?
SK1005,1012,W-Was that it?
SK1005,1013,That letter truly reflected your passionate personality, Ogami.
SK1005,1014,When we read Iris's letters, we thought she might be doing well...
SK1005,1015,Yes, but we never would've imagined she would be this cheerful.
SK1005,1016,It's because my papa and mama are here! And Mon Frère's here!
SK1005,1017,I know! If you marry me, Mon Frère, we can all be together forever!
SK1005,1018,Eep! H-Hang on a second, Iris...
SK1005,1019,Oh, Iris... Hmhmhm.
SK1005,1020,Well, if it'll make Iris happy, then we'll welcome you with open arms. Hahaha...
SK1005,1021,We're here, Chief. We finally made it to Kobe.
SK1005,1022,You must be excited. You finally get to see Mr. Howard again.
SK1005,1023,Yeah! All right, let's hustle over to Howard's!
SK1005,1024,Here it is, Mr. Howard's home. The first house I lived in when I came to Japan.
SK1005,1025,Wow, so this is where you learned how to invent stuff, huh?
SK1005,1026,Yup. Now let's head inside.
SK1005,1027,Ring the doorbell.
SK1005,1028,Walk right in.
SK1005,1029,We should ring the doorbell first, just in case. I think it's this button...
SK1005,1030,OK, let's head inside!
SK1005,1031,Wait, don't open that door!
SK1005,1032,Huh?
SK1005,1032,Huh?
SK1005,1033,This door will explode if you don't ring the doorbell first.
SK1005,1034,Really? Good thing I didn't open it, then.
SK1005,1035,All right, I'm gonna ring the doorbell now.
SK1005,1036,*cough* *cough*<br>Wh... What the...
SK1005,1037,Ohh! You always gotta ring the doorbell before coming in!
SK1005,1038,If ya don't, my Anti-Thief Trap will set a bomb off on ya!
SK1005,1039,Pops... We DID ring the doorbell.
SK1005,1040,Oh... For real? [Are you sure?] Oh, looks like I messed up the sensitivity...
SK1005,1041,Well, failure's a natural part of the inventing process! Haha, don't sweat the small stuff! No problem!
SK1005,1042,J-Just what I'd expect from Kohran's teacher...
SK1005,1043,Now come in, you two, hurry along inside. Don't be shy!
SK1005,1044,You must be all tuckered out from your long trip. Grab whatever seat you like over there.
SK1005,1045,All right. Pardon me.
SK1005,1045,All right. Pardon me.
SK1005,1046,Allow me to reintroduce you, Chief. This here's my teacher, Percy Howard!
SK1005,1047,Howdy, Ogami! I've heard allll about ya from Kohran's letters!
SK1005,1048,Hello, I'm Ichiro Ogami.
SK1005,1049,That's an interesting dialect.
SK1005,1050,Pleased to meet you.
SK1005,1051,Pleased to meetcha!
SK1005,1052,Incidentally, that's an interesting dialect you've got, there.
SK1005,1053,Oh, ya think so?
SK1005,1054,Ever since I came to Japan, I've only ever traveled between Kyoto and Osaka, so that's why I talk like this!
SK1005,1055,Which wound up rubbing off on me, too.
SK1005,1056,Oh, I-I see...
SK1005,1056,Oh, I-I see...
SK1005,1057,I am the captain of the Imperial Assault Troupe's Flower Division. Pleased to meet you.
SK1005,1058,No, no, Ogami, ya don't gotta be so stiff! Loosen up a little!
SK1005,1059,A simple "pleased to meetcha" will do! Just relax, OK? Relax!
SK1005,1060,That's right, Chief. Howard will be happier if you loosen up a bit.
SK1005,1061,R-Really? All right, I'll try.
SK1005,1062,Pleased to meetcha!
SK1005,1063,Hahaha! He's a funny man[, isn't he?] You're a real funny guy, Ogami!
SK1005,1064,Yeah, Chief here's a real riot!
SK1005,1065,Ever since I came to Japan, I've only ever traveled between Kyoto and Osaka, so that's why I talk like this!
SK1005,1066,Which wound up rubbing off on me, too.
SK1005,1067,Oh, I-I see...
SK1005,1067,Oh, I-I see...
SK1005,1068,...O-Oh? Was that all you had to say?
SK1005,1069,You're a lot more reserved than I expected. Japanese people really are a quiet bunch.
SK1005,1070,Well everyone's quiet compared to you, Howard!
SK1005,1071,By the way, this is a surprisingly normal house.
SK1005,1072,I was expecting an extravagant laboratory or something when Kohran said you were her teacher...
SK1005,1073,Heheheh...
SK1005,1073,Heheheh...
SK1005,1074,Heheh...
SK1005,1075,...?
SK1005,1075,...?
SK1005,1076,Ogami, could you close your eyes till I give ya the all-clear?
SK1005,1077,Um, sure.
SK1005,1078,Wh-Why?
SK1005,1079,Um, sure.
SK1005,1080,Wh-Why? Is there something here?
SK1005,1081,Don't worry! There won't be any more explosions or anything!
SK1005,1082,...Honest?
SK1005,1083,C'mon, Chief, he's gonna show you something neat, so shut those eyes tight.
SK1005,1084,But I won't be able to see anything with my eyes closed.
SK1005,1085,Shush, you. Just do it already.
SK1005,1086,...Like this?
SK1005,1087,OK, Kohran, switch it on!
SK1005,1088,All right, here we go!
SK1005,1089,Wh-What's that? What's going on?
SK1005,1090,Wait just a bit longer, Chief.
SK1005,1091,Sorry to keep ya waiting! You can open your eyes now.
SK1005,1092,Wh-What is this place?
SK1005,1093,Are you surprised? Shocking, right? This is my research room!
SK1005,1094,Pops' entire house is rigged with machinery.
SK1005,1095,Using specially-made elevators, you can move to any room in this house while you're sitting down!
SK1005,1096,Th-That's amazing!
SK1005,1097,Couldn't you just walk?
SK1005,1098,Th-That's amazing! What an incredible machine.
SK1005,1099,Heheheh, please, keep the praise coming.
SK1005,1100,But if it's just next door, couldn't you just walk there?
SK1005,1101,Necessity is the mother of invention, and invention is the cradle of science!
SK1005,1102,He's right, Chief, and science is a tool to make everyone happy.
SK1005,1103,...
SK1005,1103,...
SK1005,1104,Heheh, looks like you've still got lots to learn, Ogami.
SK1005,1105,By the way, Howard, what kinda research have you been up to lately?
SK1005,1106,Good question! Right now I'm designing an airplane that runs off spirit power!
SK1005,1107,For real? That's amazing. You have to tell me all about it!
SK1005,1108,I'm gonna stay here and talk with him for a minute, Chief. Make yourself at home over there.
SK1005,1109,Sheesh, those two really are obsessed with machines.
SK1005,1110,...
SK1005,1110,...
SK1005,1111,How long are they going to make me wait here, anyway...?
SK1005,1112,We're here! This is the Grand Imperial Hotel.
SK1005,1113,Your parents are meeting up here, right?
SK1005,1114,That's right. All right, Ensign, let's not waste any time and get inside!
SK1005,1115,Oh, Orhime! And Ogami! Welcome.
SK1005,1116,Ciao, Papa!
SK1005,1117,It's been a while. How are you feeling?
SK1005,1118,When I heard Carino was coming, my wounds healed in an instant. Hahaha...
SK1005,1119,...Seiya!
SK1005,1120,...?!
SK1005,1121,C-Carino?!
SK1005,1122,Ah, Seiya...
SK1005,1123,Carino!
SK1005,1124,Seiya... Finally... I finally get to see you again!
SK1005,1125,I'm so sorry, Carino.
SK1005,1126,I didn't have the courage to come see you... Not after I ran out on you and Orihime...
SK1005,1127,No, that's not it. I know more than anyone just how kind you really are.
SK1005,1128,You only left for Orihime's sake... and mine.
SK1005,1129,...
SK1005,1129,...
SK1005,1130,But... I'll never let you go again.
SK1005,1131,Even if it means losing everything... I'll never let you go ever again!
SK1005,1132,Carino!
SK1005,1133,Papa... Mamma...
SK1005,1134,Orihime...
SK1005,1135,Say something to them.
SK1005,1136,Orihime... Let's go congratulate them.
SK1005,1137,Ensign... Let's leave them alone for now.
SK1005,1138,Orihime... Let's not say anything and leave them alone for now.
SK1005,1139,Yeah, I was thinking the same thing.
SK1005,1140,Papa and Mamma weren't able to meet for over a decade...
SK1005,1141,But they still loved each other that whole time.
SK1005,1142,And now they're finally together again.
SK1005,1143,You must be Ichiro Ogami. Orihime told me all about you in her letters.
SK1005,1144,I'm her mother, Carino. Thank you so much for being there for her.
SK1005,1145,No need to thank me. I only did what I could.
SK1005,1146,Orihime truly hated Japanese men, though.
SK1005,1147,How were you able to get her to open up to you?
SK1005,1148,I think it was trust.
SK1005,1149,I think it was patience.
SK1005,1150,I think it was love.
SK1005,1151,I think it was all trust.
SK1005,1152,Trusting each other, and earning each other's trust in turn...
SK1005,1153,I think that's how we came to understand each other.
SK1005,1154,Hmhm, you're as corny as ever, Ensign.
SK1005,1155,I understand completely. It's because I trusted in Seiya that I was able to wait until this day.
SK1005,1156,Ogami, please keep believing in Orihime.
SK1005,1157,I will.
SK1005,1158,I think it was all patience.
SK1005,1159,At first, even I didn't think we'd be able to get along.
SK1005,1160,But I knew the day would come where she'd open up, so I just waited until then.
SK1005,1161,...That makes me sound like a bad person.
SK1005,1162,Hmhm, that's not it, Orihime. I understand what he means.
SK1005,1163,I too waited a long time, just for this day... The day I could see Seiya again.
SK1005,1164,Orihime... You should be thankful that Ogami waited for you for so long.
SK1005,1165,Mamma...
SK1005,1166,I think it was all love.
SK1005,1167,W-Wait a second, Ensign! What's this all of a sudden?!
SK1005,1168,Now, Orihime, expressing one's love is a very important thing.
SK1005,1169,I think it's fantastic that Ogami is able to profess his love so openly.
SK1005,1170,Mamma...
SK1005,1171,I... don't really know, either.
SK1005,1172,Hmhm, you're an honest man, Ogami.
SK1005,1173,I'm sure Orihime sensed that honesty too.
SK1005,1174,You're the man she chose. There's not a doubt in my mind that you're a wonderful person.
SK1005,1175,Orihime. You must always treasure Ogami's feelings for you.
SK1005,1176,Yes, Mamma. I understand.
SK1005,1177,Right... Ensign, could you come with me for a second?
SK1005,1178,All right, sure.
SK1005,1179,Where to?
SK1005,1180,All right, sure.
SK1005,1181,...Thank you, Ensign.
SK1005,1182,Come with you where, exactly?
SK1005,1183,Whatever, it doesn't matter, just follow me!
SK1005,1184,H-Hey, Orihime, you don't need to pull!
SK1005,1185,Come on, Ensign, quit loafing around and hurry up already.
SK1005,1186,All right Papa, Mamma, we're going to be in the lounge upstairs.
SK1005,1187,Understood.
SK1005,1188,We'll stay right here, so take your time.
SK1005,1189,All right, let's go, Ensign.
SK1005,1190,Thank you for being so considerate, Ensign.
SK1005,1191,I bet Papa and Mamma have all kinds of things they want to talk about.
SK1005,1192,Jeez, you're so inconsiderate, Ensign.
SK1005,1193,Didn't you get the hint that we should leave them alone?
SK1005,1194,S-Sorry... I didn't notice.
SK1005,1195,...Sheesh, some things never change with you.
SK1005,1196,Anyway, I had no idea up till now...
SK1005,1197,No idea that Papa and Mamma loved each other that much...
SK1005,1198,Orihime...
SK1005,1199,I really am glad for them.
SK1005,1200,I'm jealous of them.
SK1005,1201,I hope we end up like them.
SK1005,1202,I'm so glad they were finally able to reunite.
SK1005,1203,Yeah! It's great... It really is!
SK1005,1204,And it's all because you helped Papa and I patch things up.
SK1005,1205,Thank you so much, Ensign!
SK1005,1206,I'm actually jealous of them. I've never seen such a loving couple before.
SK1005,1207,They really are. But it's OK, I've already a found myself a partner.
SK1005,1208,You have? Who is it? Tell me, Orihime.
SK1005,1209,Heehee, whoever could it be?
SK1005,1210,I hope... we end up like them.
SK1005,1211,...Yeah. I'm sure we will.
SK1005,1212,Orihime...
SK1005,1212,Orihime...
SK1005,1213,All right, Ensign, until Papa and Mamma's conversation's dies down a bit...
SK1005,1214,Let's just stay up here a while, just the two of us.
SK1005,1215,Yeah, let's.
SK1005,1216,But at this rate, I don't think they'll be stopping till sunset.
SK1005,1217,Heeehee, oh, Ensign, that's perfectly all right.
SK1005,1218,Huh? Why's that?
SK1005,1219,Heehee... Because, that means we can be alone together for even longer.
SK1005,1220,All right, Reni, we're here. This is Meiji Shrine.
SK1005,1221,...
SK1005,1222,...Reni? What's wrong?
SK1005,1223,Torii gates...
SK1005,1224,Huh? What about them?
SK1005,1225,Whenever we fought against the Black Demons...
SK1005,1226,There were always torii gates where we fought.
SK1005,1227,I wonder if there's some kind of connection...
SK1005,1228,Now that you mention it...
SK1005,1229,You're just imagining things.
SK1005,1230,Now that you mention it, you're right. That's way too many to be a coincidence.
SK1005,1231,...
SK1005,1232,Once we get back, let's analyze them with the steam processor.
SK1005,1233,...Good call.
SK1005,1234,You're just imagining things, Reni. There just happened to be torii gates there.
SK1005,1235,After all, the capital's filled with shrines and temples.
SK1005,1236,Besides, we beat the Black Demons, so there's nothing to be worried about anymore.
SK1005,1237,...I wonder.
SK1005,1238,...Really? I don't remember that.
SK1005,1239,I'll look into it some more once we get back.
SK1005,1240,Yeah, that might not be a bad idea.
SK1005,1241,For now, though, let's just enjoy our shrine visit, all right, Reni?
SK1005,1242,...Yeah, got it.
SK1005,1243,All right, let's head inside the shrine grounds.
SK1005,1244,As expected, Meiji Shrine is packed with people going on their first shrine visit of the year.
SK1005,1245,Captain, what's this arrow?
SK1005,1246,Hm? Which one?
SK1005,1247,It's apparently called a... "hamaya."
SK1005,1248,It's a good luck charm.
SK1005,1249,It's a weapon.
SK1005,1250,It's a firework chant.
SK1005,1251,It's a good luck charm for the New Year. The name "hamaya" means "arrow that destroys evil."
SK1005,1252,I see...
SK1005,1252,I see...
SK1005,1253,It's a weapon. It IS an arrow, after all.
SK1005,1254,But it's covered in so many decorations, it doesn't look very practical.
SK1005,1255,It's a chant you shout out during fireworks... Just kidding.
SK1005,1256,Isn't that "tamaya"?
SK1005,1257,Wow, Reni, you sure know a lot.
SK1005,1258,I remembered from when we set off fireworks during out summer vacation.
SK1005,1259,Oh, I-I see...
SK1005,1260,Hmmm... Sorry, I don't really know, either.
SK1005,1261,All right, I'll look it up when we get back.
SK1005,1262,By the way, how are you enjoying your first New Year's shrine visit?
SK1005,1263,There's so many things I've never seen before, I'm overcome with curiosity.
SK1005,1264,I see. I'm glad you like it.
SK1005,1265,Let's go look at some more things, then.
SK1005,1266,Yeah.
SK1005,1266,Yeah.
SK1005,1267,Captain, what is this place?
SK1005,1268,Ah, this is a place that sells fortunes and charms.
SK1005,1269,...Fortunes?
SK1005,1270,Um... I guess it's sort of like a horoscope.
SK1005,1271,There'll be things like "good luck" or "bad luck" written on this piece of paper, and it'll tell you your fortune.
SK1005,1272,Let's give it a shot, Reni. It'll make more sense if you try it yourself.
SK1005,1273,Sure. In that case...
SK1005,1274,...
SK1005,1275,Urgh! I got... "bad luck"...
SK1005,1276,Even worse, it says: "Beware of drowning"...
SK1005,1277,So that symbol means unlucky? Then... what does this mean?
SK1005,1278,Let's see here...
SK1005,1279,Whoa! You got: "Great luck"! That's the best one!
SK1005,1280,...Is it, now.
SK1005,1281,Good for you, Reni!
SK1005,1282,...Wanna trade?
SK1005,1283,I can't believe you got "great luck" right away. Good for you, Reni!
SK1005,1284,And "great luck" is the best one, right?
SK1005,1285,Yeah. This year's definitely gonna be a good one for you.
SK1005,1286,There's no harm in believing in it if you got great luck.
SK1005,1287,Got it. I will, then.
SK1005,1288,I got bad luck, so I don't really want to believe mine, though. Hahaha...
SK1005,1289,...
SK1005,1290,If it's all right with you... How's about a trade?
SK1005,1291,Sure.<br>Here you go.
SK1005,1292,K-Kidding, I was just kidding! There's no way I could take that from you!
SK1005,1293,I don't really mind.
SK1005,1294,Still, I can't believe I pulled "bad luck" first thing this year...
SK1005,1295,Captain, it's odd you'd give so much weight to a scrap of paper like this.
SK1005,1296,Hmmm... It DOES bug me, though.
SK1005,1297,A person's future is determined by their actions and environment.
SK1005,1298,A piece of paper like this won't change that.
SK1005,1299,Reni...
SK1005,1300,Though reading one's fortune at the start of a new year does have a psychological effect.
SK1005,1301,What the heck, Reni... You just had to go and say that as I was starting to feel better.
SK1005,1302,*sigh* Can't believe I got bad luck... Well, after bad luck comes good fortune, though, right? Hahaha.
SK1005,1303,Sorry, Ogami, but each customer is only allowed to purchase one photo at a time.
SK1005,1304,I see. That's too bad.
SK1005,1305,My apologies, Ogami, but each customer is only allowed to purchase one photo at a time.
SK1005,1306,Oh, really? That's too bad.
SK1005,1306,Oh, really? That's too bad.

SK1005,1375,... "" "" () - . , ! ? ?! !!
SK1006,1,Finally... The time has come.
SK1006,2,With the Pandemonium Regalia gone, there are none left who can oppose me.
SK1006,3,Tsuchigumo!
SK1006,4,Yes, sir!
SK1006,5,Kongo!
SK1006,6,Yes, sir!
SK1006,7,And... Demon King.
SK1006,8,...Yes, my lord.
SK1006,9,At long last, the day has come for the capital to kneel at my feet.
SK1006,10,To kneel before... Kyogoku.
SK1006,11,Yes, sir...
SK1006,12,Demon King... I trust that our vanguard is ready to deploy?
SK1006,13,Yes, sir. Right this way...
SK1006,14,During the Kouma War, the army gathered Kouma corpses in total secrecy...
SK1006,15,And by extracting the spirit power from their tissue, their bodies were rebuilt into the army's ultimate weapons.
SK1006,16,Kouma Weapons"... The day has finally come for you to assault the capital.
SK1006,17,Skreeee!!
SK1006,18,Kongo, Tsuchigumo, I leave the Imperial Assault Troupe to you.
SK1006,19,Those vermin are certain to appear. I expect you to make up for your failures at Akasaka.
SK1006,20,Yes, sir! Even if it costs me my life!
SK1006,21,I'll bury the Imperial Assault Troupe with my own hands!
SK1006,22,Now go! To the site of the final seal... To Ouji!
SK1006,23,The time has come to activate the Octagram of Demonic Calling!
SK1006,24,The time... for Musashi's return!
SK1006,25,Yes, my lord!
SK1006,26,Hmmm...
SK1006,27,*yawn*... Morning already?
SK1006,28,Hm? Something smells good...
SK1006,29,Sakura, grab the sweet sake and soy sauce, would you?
SK1006,30,Yes, Mother.
SK1006,31,Are they making breakfast? They sound really happy...
SK1006,32,Wake up now.
SK1006,33,Sleep in a bit longer.
SK1006,34,OK, time to get up. I can't keep sleeping forever.
SK1006,35,Oh, Ogami. Good morning.
SK1006,36,Good morning. Did you sleep well last night?
SK1006,37,Good morning.<br>I slept like a log.
SK1006,38,Breakfast is almost ready, so wait just a little longer.
SK1006,39,Thanks. I'll go get changed, then.
SK1006,40,*yawn*... I'm still drowsy. I'll sleep in just a bit longer...
SK1006,41,Wake up, Ogami, it's morning.
SK1006,42,Good morning, Sakura.
SK1006,43,Just 5 more minutes...
SK1006,44,Ah, good morning, Sakura.
SK1006,45,Good morning. Did you sleep well?
SK1006,46,Yeah, I slept like a log.
SK1006,47,Really? Hmhm, glad to hear it.
SK1006,48,We finished making breakfast, so get changed and come to the living room, OK?
SK1006,49,Breakfast at Sakura's, huh?
SK1006,50,Just 5 more minutes...
SK1006,51,Oh, Ogami, you're hopeless.
SK1006,52,We finished making breakfast, so get changed and come to the living room, OK?
SK1006,53,Hurry up before it gets cold!
SK1006,54,C-Crap, my breakfast is gonna get cold!
SK1006,55,I gotta get changed, quick!
SK1006,56,...
SK1006,57,Heehee, Ogami's fast asleep...
SK1006,58,...
SK1006,59,Wake up, dear...<br>It's morning...
SK1006,60,Huh?! S-Sakura...
SK1006,61,Eek! O-Ogami... Were you awake this whole time?!
SK1006,62,Oh, jeez... Hurry and get up already! It's time for breakfast!
SK1006,63,S-Sakura...
SK1006,64,OK, let's eat!
SK1006,65,There's plenty to go around, so eat as much as you'd like!
SK1006,66,Sakura made this breakfast almost entirely by herself.
SK1006,67,Hmhm, I tried to make it just like Mother's!
SK1006,68,*chew* *chew*
SK1006,69,Well, Ogami...? How does it taste?
SK1006,70,It's great!
SK1006,71,Um... It's OK.
SK1006,72,It's great! This is delicious, Sakura!
SK1006,73,Really? Thank you so much!
SK1006,74,You've gotten quite good at seasoning, haven't you, Sakura?
SK1006,75,Yes, I practiced to make it taste just like yours!
SK1006,76,Though I do think the miso soup could stand to be a bit lighter.
SK1006,77,Huh, really? OK, you'll have to teach me how afterward!
SK1006,78,(So this is the taste of a family, huh?)
SK1006,79,(This must be how a flavor gets passed on to future generations...)
SK1006,80,Um... It's OK.
SK1006,81,I... I see...
SK1006,82,I think the miso soup should've been a bit lighter.
SK1006,83,I'll teach you the trick to making it later.
SK1006,84,Your father was always so fussy about his miso soup...
SK1006,85,Wow... You absolutely have to tell me!
SK1006,86,I want to cook just like you... The way Father liked it!
SK1006,87,(So this is the taste of a family, huh?)
SK1006,88,(This must be how a flavor gets passed on to future generations...)
SK1006,89,Hmm... I dunno if I like it or not...
SK1006,90,Come on, Ogami, which one is it?
SK1006,91,Thanks for the meal.
SK1006,92,It was nothing.
SK1006,93,Sakura, when you have a minute, go visit your father's grave, will you?
SK1006,94,Huh? But Mother...
SK1006,95,Please.
SK1006,96,...OK! All right, Ogami, let's go right away.
SK1006,97,We're here, Ogami. This is my father's grave.
SK1006,98,Whoa... There's a tomb in this rock!
SK1006,99,Ogami... The truth is...
SK1006,100,Nobody outside of the Shinguji family has ever been allowed to see the Shinguji family tomb.
SK1006,101,Huh?! Then... does that mean that I'm...?
SK1006,102,...L-Let's go inside, Ogami.
SK1006,103,Y-Yeah.
SK1006,104,Father, it's Sakura. I'm finally back home.
SK1006,105,The captain of the Imperial Assault Troupe's Flower Division, Ichiro Ogami, is with me today.
SK1006,106,...
SK1006,107,Father. We...
SK1006,108,We're carrying out your final wish and fighting our hardest to protect the peace in the capital.
SK1006,109,So please, keep watching over us... Over the Imperial Assault Troupe.
SK1006,110,...
SK1006,111,OK, Ogami, let's go.
SK1006,112,Yeah...
SK1006,113,...!
SK1006,114,That noise... Is that the cinematron ringing?!
SK1006,115,Ogami, let's answer it right away!
SK1006,116,Ogami? Thank goodness, I finally got through.
SK1006,117,Kaede! What on earth is going on?!
SK1006,118,We have an emergency.<br>Hostiles have been sighted in Ouji!
SK1006,119,Wha... What did you just say?!
SK1006,120,We still don't know all the details. The rest of the Flower Division have already deployed.
SK1006,121,The Soaring Whale is en route to your location. Return here ASAP!
SK1006,122,Get back to the theater immediately, you two!
SK1006,123,Roger, ma'am!
SK1006,124,Sakura! We've got hostiles!
SK1006,125,Y-Yes, sir!
SK1006,126,The Soaring Whale's coming to get us. We're headed back to the capital!
SK1006,127,Ogami... I heard everything.
SK1006,128,Mother!
SK1006,129,Please, look after Sakura, Ogami.
SK1006,130,I'm sorry, Mother! I wanted to stay here longer, but...
SK1006,131,Getting to see you happy and healthy was more than enough for me. Now, go!
SK1006,132,I'll be praying for your success, Ogami.
SK1006,133,...Yes, ma'am.
SK1006,134,I'll be going, then, Mother...
SK1006,135,Don't die on me.
SK1006,136,She's coming back alive. I promise.
SK1006,137,We'll drop by again.
SK1006,138,I promise you, she's coming back alive... I promise.
SK1006,139,Ogami...
SK1006,140,We'll drop by again sometime, and when we do, we'll stay even longer.
SK1006,141,All right. I'll be waiting for your return.
SK1006,142,Mother...
SK1006,143,I'll teach you how to make miso soup then, Sakura.
SK1006,144,...OK!
SK1006,145,I'll be all right, Mother. With Ogami at my side, I can give it my all!
SK1006,146,That sound.. It's the Soaring Whale!
SK1006,147,We're going now, Mother!
SK1006,148,Come back safely, Sakura.
SK1006,149,Ogami, look after her.
SK1006,150,...Yes, ma'am!
SK1006,151,Phew... My stomach's finally settled.
SK1006,152,Speaking of which, Sumire's still not back yet...
SK1006,153,Oh, Master Ogami.<br>Are you alone?
SK1006,154,Yeah. Do you know where Sumire's gone?
SK1006,155,Now that you mention it, she just left for a walk with Mistress Hinako.
SK1006,156,I see...
SK1006,157,Go look for them.
SK1006,158,Stay where you are.
SK1006,159,OK, I'll go look for then.
SK1006,160,I believe they went out to the yard.
SK1006,161,The yard, huh? Thank you, Miyata.
SK1006,162,I'm sure Sumire and her mother have a lot to talk about. I'll leave them be.
SK1006,163,Well then, Master Ogami, perhaps you might enjoy an after-meal stroll in the yard in the meantime?
SK1006,164,I see, that does sound nice.
SK1006,165,All right, I'll wander around a little, then.
SK1006,166,Very good, sir. I'll let you know once the young mistress has returned.
SK1006,167,In the meantime, perhaps you might enjoy an after-meal stroll in the yard, Master Ogami?
SK1006,168,Once the young mistress has returned, I'll let you know right away.
SK1006,169,I see, that does sound nice.
SK1006,170,All right, I'll follow your suggestion and go wander around a little.
SK1006,171,Phew, looking for Sumire in such a huge yard sure is a hassle.
SK1006,172,At any rate, I wonder what those two are talking about?
SK1006,173,Ah, what great weather. Not a cloud in the sky.
SK1006,174,But boy, it feels like you could easily get lost in a yard as huge as this.
SK1006,175,Sumire, I have something I wanted to tell you.
SK1006,176,...!
SK1006,177,Could that voice be...?
SK1006,178,(I knew it, it's Sumire and Hinako.)
SK1006,179,What is it, Mother?
SK1006,180,I wanted to apologize for the arranged marriage.
SK1006,181,We should have stopped your grandfather.
SK1006,182,...
SK1006,183,I know you must feel bitter towards him...
SK1006,184,Oh, I'm not bitter. I'm furious!
SK1006,185,Not only did he lie about being sick, he tried to force me into an arranged marriage!
SK1006,186,He can be quite overbearing, but that's how the Kanzaki family got to where it is today.
SK1006,187,You and your grandfather are quite alike, so...
SK1006,188,So what, Mother?! You want me to take over the Kanzaki family, is that it?
SK1006,189,I refuse! I'm a member of the Imperial Assault Troupe now!
SK1006,190,Sumire...
SK1006,191,...
SK1006,192,Do as you wish. You're still young, after all.
SK1006,193,But you just recently received those new spirit armors, the Tenbu, didn't you?
SK1006,194,Their development was very expensive, and the one who backed it... was your grandfather.
SK1006,195,...!
SK1006,196,Sumire... Love takes many forms.
SK1006,197,It can be clumsy, overbearing, or cold...
SK1006,198,But accepting that is also its own form of love.
SK1006,199,Your father, your grandfather... And myself, of course...
SK1006,200,We all truly love you.
SK1006,201,Mother...
SK1006,202,(...)
SK1006,203,I see... So the Tenbu were financed by the Kanzaki Zaibatsu...
SK1006,204,Oh, Master Ogami! There you are!
SK1006,205,What's the matter, Miyata?
SK1006,206,There's a strange beeping noise coming from Mistress Sumire's room.
SK1006,207,Beeping noise?
SK1006,208,The Cinematron!
SK1006,209,The alarm clock?
SK1006,210,That's right! That must be the cinematron ringing!
SK1006,211,The cinema... What now?
SK1006,212,It's, well, did you see a strangely shaped device in there?
SK1006,213,Yes, yes I did! I brought it out to the entrance for the time being.
SK1006,214,A beeping noise from her room? That must be an alarm clock then, right?
SK1006,215,P-Preposterous! There's no need for an alarm clock to be as noisy as this thing!
SK1006,216,It's a strange little device making that beeping noise.
SK1006,217,Wait, what?! Then that beeping might be... the cinematron!
SK1006,218,For the time being, I brought it out to the entrance.
SK1006,219,Let's see, was there anything in her room that you think could be making that noise?
SK1006,220,Well, it's some strange device that's making that beeping noise.
SK1006,221,Wait, what?! Then that beeping might be... the cinematron!
SK1006,222,For the time being, I brought it out to the entrance.
SK1006,223,I see, thank you!
SK1006,224,Miyata, go get Sumire! She should still be in the yard!
SK1006,225,Yes, sir! Understood!
SK1006,226,So it was the cinematron after all!
SK1006,227,But then... What on earth is going on?!
SK1006,228,Ensign!
SK1006,229,Miyata told me everything. We're getting a call on the cinematron, right?
SK1006,230,We must answer it, right away!
SK1006,231,Yeah. All right, I'm picking up...
SK1006,232,Ogami? Thank goodness, I finally got through.
SK1006,233,Kaede! What on earth is going on?!
SK1006,234,We have an emergency.<br>Hostiles have been sighted in Ouji!
SK1006,235,Wha... What did you just say?!
SK1006,236,We still don't know all the details. The rest of the Flower Division have already deployed.
SK1006,237,The Soaring Whale is en route to your location. Return here ASAP!
SK1006,238,Get back to the theater immediately, you two!
SK1006,239,Roger, ma'am!
SK1006,240,There's no time to dawdle about, Ensign.
SK1006,241,Yeah. We have to get to Ouji, quickly!
SK1006,242,...
SK1006,243,Sumire... Go and live your life to the fullest.
SK1006,244,...I will.
SK1006,245,S-Sumire... When will you come by to visit again? We should have a party when you do.
SK1006,246,A party just for you. We'll hire chefs from around the world, and then... Uhh...
SK1006,247,I'll buy you all the things you want... And then... Sumire... We love you.
SK1006,248,Father...
SK1006,249,Ogami... Take care of Sumire.
SK1006,250,Yes, ma'am!
SK1006,251,We'll stop by again sometime.
SK1006,252,Yes, ma'am! I swear to protect Sumire!
SK1006,253,Ensign...
SK1006,254,Ogami... Thank you.
SK1006,255,Sumire and I will stop by again sometime.
SK1006,256,Right, Sumire?
SK1006,257,...Yes. We'll come back... if I feel like it.
SK1006,258,You can come whenever you like. You're always welcome here.
SK1006,259,I'll be all right, Mother.
SK1006,260,With the Ensign by my side, I have nothing to fear.
SK1006,261,Sumire...
SK1006,262,Father, Mother, I'm going.
SK1006,263,Be safe. Come visit us again sometime.
SK1006,264,Sumire, um... Maybe you can treat us to some of your cooking next time?
SK1006,265,...Yes, I will. Look forward to it.
SK1006,266,Mother... Give Grandfather my regards.
SK1006,267,I understand. I'll be sure to tell him.
SK1006,268,Let us be off, Ensign! It's time for our grand entrance!
SK1006,269,Yeah, let's go, Sumire!
SK1006,270,...
SK1006,271,Ogami... Please, protect my dear Sumire!
SK1006,272,The smell of the ocean sure takes me back. Reminds me of my time in the Naval Academy.
SK1006,273,Oh, looks like one of the ships is just about to leave port.
SK1006,274,Judging by its size, I'm guessing its headed abroad.
SK1006,275,...
SK1006,276,Maria? What's the matter?
SK1006,277,...
SK1006,278,I was just... thinking about my time in Russia.
SK1006,279,About why I abandoned Russia and ran away to America.
SK1006,280,Was I tired of all the fighting and poverty? Did I yearn for personal freedom?
SK1006,281,Even now... I'm not really sure.
SK1006,282,...
SK1006,283,But nevertheless, I did run away... From myself as well. Now I'm but a wanderer.
SK1006,284,*sigh* Sometimes I hate how weak I can be... I have to be stronger.
SK1006,285,Not just for myself, but for the Flower Division as well... Right, Captain?
SK1006,286,(Maria...)
SK1006,287,Say something to Maria.
SK1006,288,Maria...
SK1006,289,...
SK1006,290,Captain... Do you mind if I cry...?
SK1006,291,N-not at all...
SK1006,292,...
SK1006,293,...
SK1006,294,(Maria...)
SK1006,295,(Maria...)
SK1006,296,Moya rodina...<br>(My motherland...)
SK1006,297,...
SK1006,298,...! Is that the cinematron ringing?!
SK1006,299,...Captain.
SK1006,300,Yeah, seems like we've received a transmission.
SK1006,301,What could it be?
SK1006,302,Ogami? Thank goodness, I finally got through.
SK1006,303,Kaede! What on earth is going on?!
SK1006,304,We have an emergency.<br>Hostiles have been sighted in Ouji!
SK1006,305,Wha... What did you just say?!
SK1006,306,We still don't know all the details. The rest of the Flower Division have already deployed.
SK1006,307,The Soaring Whale is en route to your location. Return here ASAP!
SK1006,308,Get back to the theater immediately, you two!
SK1006,309,Roger, ma'am!
SK1006,310,Looks like we've got a situation on our hands, Captain.
SK1006,311,Yeah, I'm still not sure what's going on, but we have to get back, and fast.
SK1006,312,...
SK1006,313,The fighting's starting once again.
SK1006,314,Maria...
SK1006,315,Gently cheer her up.
SK1006,316,Forcefully cheer her up.
SK1006,317,I know it won't replace your family or your homeland, Maria...
SK1006,318,But I'm here to support you.
SK1006,319,...Yes, Captain.
SK1006,320,I'll always be at your side, Maria.
SK1006,321,If there's anything burdening you...
SK1006,322,Then maybe I can help relieve some of it for you.
SK1006,323,Captain... Thank you.
SK1006,324,You don't have to say anything, Maria.
SK1006,325,I'll always be there at your side.
SK1006,326,Captain...
SK1006,327,There's something I've learned since I joined the Imperial Assault Troupe.
SK1006,328,To live means to experience loss...
SK1006,329,But it's because I'm alive that I get to meet so many new people.
SK1006,330,Yeah, and it's because you're alive that I got to meet you.
SK1006,331,That's why we're coming back from this alive, Maria!
SK1006,332,We'll make sure everyone knows the joy of peace!
SK1006,333,Yes, sir!
SK1006,334,All right, let's go! To protect our capital... and our Flower Division!
SK1006,335,U... Uh...
SK1006,336,...Huh? Guess I must've dozed off.
SK1006,337,Right, we were having a drink-off in front of the tomb...
SK1006,338,And I passed out as soon as we got back to Kanna's house.
SK1006,339,Huh? Kanna's not here.
SK1006,340,Go look for Kanna.
SK1006,341,I'm worried about Kanna... All right, I'll go look for her.
SK1006,342,Eh, this is Kanna we're talking about, she'll be fine.
SK1006,343,...
SK1006,344,...
SK1006,345,Nope, too worried to sleep after all.
SK1006,346,Well, I'm wide awake, so I might as well go for a walk and look for her.
SK1006,347,She's not anywhere around the house...
SK1006,348,That means the only place left would be near the tomb.
SK1006,349,Dad...
SK1006,350,(So Kanna was here all along...)
SK1006,351,Dad... Why'd you have to go and die like that? There's so much more I wanted to learn from you...
SK1006,352,Dumbass...
SK1006,353,(...)
SK1006,354,Dad... I'll become an Unai.
SK1006,355,I wasn't able to be yours, but the Boss...
SK1006,356,I'll be his Unai, you'll see...
SK1006,357,(Kanna...)
SK1006,358,Hey, Dad, listen to this. I got to play a female role. The lead role, no less.
SK1006,359,Because my Boss... He chose me.
SK1006,360,At first, I had no idea how it was gonna turn out...
SK1006,361,But he and I both gave it all we got, and the crowd loved it.
SK1006,362,(...)
SK1006,363,It's too bad you aren't able to see any of my plays...
SK1006,364,But he and I will keep doin' our best.
SK1006,365,...
SK1006,366,Inago ikusa nu sachiba...<br>(In battle, the woman leads the charge...)
SK1006,367,(Kanna...)
SK1006,368,...Boss.
SK1006,369,...Hm?
SK1006,370,C'mon, it's morning. Wake up, Boss.
SK1006,371,Uh... Kanna?
SK1006,372,You musta been exhausted. You were sleepin' like a baby.
SK1006,373,Kanna...
SK1006,374,Hm? What's up, Boss?
SK1006,375,About last night...
SK1006,376,...No, it's nothing.
SK1006,377,About last night... Did you go to the tomb?
SK1006,378,You mean to my dad's grave?
SK1006,379,Yeah, I saw you there last night.
SK1006,380,Hahahaha! Maybe in your dreams, you did.
SK1006,381,You did drink quite a bit last night, so that makes sense.
SK1006,382,Hmmm... Was it really just a dream?
SK1006,383,C'mon, forget all this dream talk, let's grab breakfast.
SK1006,384,N-not at all...
SK1006,385,...No, it's nothing.
SK1006,386,What's with you, Boss? I'm gettin' a little concerned, now.
SK1006,387,Don't worry about it, Kanna. It's nothing, really.
SK1006,388,But more importantly, is it time for breakfast yet?
SK1006,389,Yeah, it's all ready. Now, shall we eat?
SK1006,390,Was that just... a dream?
SK1006,391,Hey, Boss, you still half-asleep?
SK1006,392,C'mon, go wash up. Breakfast is ready.
SK1006,393,N-not at all...
SK1006,394,...Hm?
SK1006,395,That sound... No way!
SK1006,396,It's the cinematron! It's ringing!
SK1006,397,All the way out here? What the hell's goin' on?!
SK1006,398,No clue. Let's answer it and see.
SK1006,399,Ogami? Thank goodness, I finally got through.
SK1006,400,Kaede! What on earth is going on?!
SK1006,401,We have an emergency.<br>Hostiles have been sighted in Ouji!
SK1006,402,Wha... What did you just say?!
SK1006,403,We still don't know all the details. The rest of the Flower Division have already deployed.
SK1006,404,The Soaring Whale is en route to your location. Return here ASAP!
SK1006,405,Get back to the theater immediately, you two!
SK1006,406,Roger, ma'am!
SK1006,407,Looks like we got a situation here, Boss.
SK1006,408,Yeah. Time to fight again, Kanna.
SK1006,409,I'll be all right. As long as we're together, Boss, I'm not afraid of anything.
SK1006,410,As long as we're together, we're not losin' to anybody!
SK1006,411,Kanna...
SK1006,412,Yeah, we'll always be together.
SK1006,413,We should come back sometime.
SK1006,414,Kanna, I know you've been alone ever since your father died...
SK1006,415,But I'm not leaving you alone anymore. We'll always be together!
SK1006,416,Boss... Thanks!
SK1006,417,We should come back sometime, Kanna.
SK1006,418,I want to drink more awamori and eat more Okinawan food...
SK1006,419,Plus, I'd like to get a chance to talk to your dad some more.
SK1006,420,Yeah! We'll definitely come back! Together!
SK1006,421,Kanna... We don't have to say a thing to each other.
SK1006,422,Yeah, you're right.
SK1006,423,No matter who we're up against, we're not gonna lose!
SK1006,424,We'll protect our friends! That's what the Imperial Assault Troupe fights for!
SK1006,425,Zzz... Zzz...
SK1006,426,Iris is sound asleep.
SK1006,427,She probably tired herself out from all that romping around.
SK1006,428,At any rate, that girl's grown to be so cheerful.
SK1006,429,Yes, indeed.
SK1006,430,Ogami. You know about her power, don't you?
SK1006,431,...I do.
SK1006,432,We noticed that power soon after she was born.
SK1006,433,We were overcome with worry, and so, we kept her away from the outside world.
SK1006,434,We thought the outside world would be... too harsh on her.
SK1006,435,...
SK1006,436,But we were mistaken. Iris wasn't some bird meant to be locked in a cage.
SK1006,437,Seeing her smiling face today, I know that now.
SK1006,438,I know that Iris is as happy as can be with you and the others in the Flower Division.
SK1006,439,We want nothing more than to live with Iris, from the bottom of our hearts.
SK1006,440,But what Iris needs now... is you. All of you.
SK1006,441,Iris is our precious treasure. So please, Ogami... Look after her.
SK1006,442,I'll protect Iris.
SK1006,443,Come visit again.
SK1006,444,Yes, sir. No matter what happens, I will protect Iris.
SK1006,445,Thank you...
SK1006,446,We believe in you, Ogami.
SK1006,447,Come visit again whenever you like.
SK1006,448,That way you can see Iris grow up, little by little.
SK1006,449,Ogami... Thank you so much.
SK1006,450,We'll definitely come back... Definitely.
SK1006,451,Iris...
SK1006,452,Uhhh... Mm...
SK1006,453,Ah... Was I... asleep?
SK1006,454,Oh my. Sorry for waking you up, Iris.
SK1006,455,I heard Mon Frère's voice and woke up.
SK1006,456,Hahaha, like Sleeping Beauty awoken by the prince's kiss.
SK1006,457,Huh? What did you say? Did Mon Frère... kiss me?
SK1006,458,...Wha?
SK1006,459,Hm hm hm... Maybe when you're a little older, Iris.
SK1006,460,N-Not you too...
SK1006,461,Huh? Is that an alarm clock I'm hearing?
SK1006,462,No! It's the cinematron!
SK1006,463,What could've possibly happened? All right, let me take it out.
SK1006,464,Ogami? Thank goodness, I finally got through.
SK1006,465,Kaede! What on earth is going on?!
SK1006,466,We have an emergency.<br>Hostiles have been sighted in Ouji!
SK1006,467,Wha... What did you just say?!
SK1006,468,We still don't know all the details. The rest of the Flower Division have already deployed.
SK1006,469,The Soaring Whale is en route to your location. Return here ASAP!
SK1006,470,Get back to the theater immediately, you two!
SK1006,471,Roger, ma'am!
SK1006,472,Iris... We have to go.
SK1006,473,...Yeah.
SK1006,474,I see... That's too bad. I was hoping we'd get to talk a while longer.
SK1006,475,We'll escort you outside, dear.
SK1006,476,Papa... Mama... I'm going.
SK1006,477,OK. Come back safely.
SK1006,478,Be careful.
SK1006,479,...
SK1006,480,Iris? What's wrong?
SK1006,481,...
SK1006,482,Iris... You're feeling lonely, aren't you?
SK1006,483,Why don't you say goodbye to them, just one more time?
SK1006,484,But...
SK1006,485,Speak kindly to her.
SK1006,486,Be tactful.
SK1006,487,Iris... Go see them.
SK1006,488,Your Papa and Mama want to be with you.
SK1006,489,But... They have to stay behind while you head to battle.
SK1006,490,So that's why you need to tell them "I'm coming back."
SK1006,491,Really? Is that OK?
SK1006,492,Yeah. Go to them.
SK1006,493,OK! Thank you, Mon Frère!
SK1006,494,I'm... starting to feel a little seasick.
SK1006,495,Huh? Are you OK, Mon Frère?
SK1006,496,Yeah, I'll be fine. It'll blow over eventually.
SK1006,497,So... Why don't you go talk to your parents until I feel better?
SK1006,498,Mon Frère...
SK1006,499,Thanks, Mon Frère. I'll be right back!
SK1006,500,Please, Mon Frère... Can I talk to my Papa and Mama one more time?
SK1006,501,...Yeah, sure. Go ahead.
SK1006,502,OK! Thank you, Mon Frère!
SK1006,503,Papaaa! Mamaaa!
SK1006,504,Iris!
SK1006,505,Iris!
SK1006,506,I promise... I'm coming back!
SK1006,507,I'll be back for you, Papa, and you, Mama!
SK1006,508,Iris... Thank you.
SK1006,509,Iris... Your Papa and Mama will wait for you as long as it takes!
SK1006,510,OK!
SK1006,511,All right, Papa, Mama... I'll be back!
SK1006,512,By the way, you're the one who formally taught Kohran mechanics, right, Mr. Howard?
SK1006,513,That's right! She's probably better than me at this point, though.
SK1006,514,What are you saying, Howard? I'm still only learning.
SK1006,515,Besides, you'll always be my teacher, no matter how much time passes.
SK1006,516,Oh, that's right! I still have a bunch of Kohran's inventions from way back!
SK1006,517,Wanna see 'em, Ogami?
SK1006,518,Absolutely, please!
SK1006,519,I'll pass.
SK1006,520,...They won't blow up, right?
SK1006,521,Absolutely, please!
SK1006,522,You still got all that stuff, Pops?
SK1006,523,Of course I do! I've been taking good care of them all this time!
SK1006,524,Right then, follow me, you two!
SK1006,525,I'm not particularly interested, so I'll pass.
SK1006,526,You're being a real downer, Chief.
SK1006,527,All right then, maybe you can come take a look by yourself?
SK1006,528,Yeah, I'll go take a look! I haven't seen my old inventions in ages!
SK1006,529,Ah... They left.
SK1006,530,Oh well, guess I should go check it out too.
SK1006,531,Those inventions won't blow up... right?
SK1006,532,You've got nothin' to fear! They're all properly powered down!
SK1006,533,All right, Chief, let's go see 'em right away.
SK1006,534,Hmm, what to do...
SK1006,535,Quit fussing, Chief. C'mon, let's go!
SK1006,536,Right then, follow me, you two!
SK1006,537,Wow... So many nostalgic inventions!
SK1006,538,Go ahead, Ogami, take a gander!
SK1006,539,All right, let's have a look.
SK1006,540,That's a steam gramophone. It lets you listen to records using steam power.
SK1006,541,Wow, that seems useful.
SK1006,542,One problem, though. The needle doesn't sit still, thanks to the steam motor's vibrations.
SK1006,543,The concept was sound, but it wasn't practical in the end.
SK1006,544,I see... A gramophone.
SK1006,545,If I could get the vibration problem solved, it'd totally work, though.
SK1006,546,That's a steam-powered pressure cooker!
SK1006,547,It's one of the rare successful inventions of mine from that time.
SK1006,548,Wow. What can you make with it?
SK1006,549,You can cook rice, steam potatoes...
SK1006,550,You can make all sortsa stuff! It's a multipurpose cooking machine!
SK1006,551,(A cooking machine, huh? Guess even Kohran makes some practical inventions from time to time.)
SK1006,552,That's the steam cleaner. It's a machine that runs around and picks up garbage fully automatically!
SK1006,553,Wow, that's amazing. So why didn't it work out?
SK1006,554,Hmmm... Well, it ran around a little TOO fast.
SK1006,555,Once you'd start it up, you weren't able to catch it...
SK1006,556,Not only that, but time after time it mistook my important documents as garbage.
SK1006,557,Hahaha, that's unfortunate.
SK1006,558,Still, this could work if you refined it, don't you think?
SK1006,559,Yeah, you're right. I'll try making it again once we get back to the theater.
SK1006,560,This is a steam camera. It takes full-colored photos...
SK1006,561,But it's so heavy, it's exhausting to carry around.
SK1006,562,Kohran always had me carry it for her. That camera's the cause of so much suffering.
SK1006,563,It's not so bad, Howard. You got to take pictures and exercise! Ya killed two birds with one stone!
SK1006,564,In the end, it served as the model for the Koubu's camera scope.
SK1006,565,I see... So all that work didn't go to waste.
SK1006,566,This here's a steam clock. Steam power makes the hands move when you wind it up.
SK1006,567,The steam whistle makes for a good alarm, but...
SK1006,568,It was so loud, it shattered all the glass in the house.
SK1006,569,It's more likely to make you pass out than wake up! Hahahaha!
SK1006,570,Boy, it caused quite the commotion the first time we used it.
SK1006,571,This here's a steam-powered mosquito coil. 
SK1006,572,A charming device that integrates your traditional Japanese pig-shaped mosquito coil holder with steam power.
SK1006,573,Wow... What a fascinating invention.
SK1006,574,However, there was a problem with the steam power used to run it.
SK1006,575,It repelled mosquitoes well enough, but it was so hot and noisy, it actually made it HARDER to sleep.
SK1006,576,Hahaha, putting the cart before the horse, eh?
SK1006,577,Man, that takes me back. I made all kindsa stuff, didn't I...
SK1006,578,This here's a steam-powered transceiver. Guess you could call it the prototype for the cinematron.
SK1006,579,I wasn't able to get the screens working in the end, so I had to shelve it.
SK1006,580,There was a lot leading up to the cinematron, huh?
SK1006,581,(I guess even inventions can be long-term endeavors sometimes.)
SK1006,582,(Kohran looks so happy, her eyes are practically twinkling.)
SK1006,583,(She truly loves machines, from the bottom of her heart.)
SK1006,584,Stop looking at ME, Chief, look at my inventions!
SK1006,585,Where are ya going, Chief? Check out my inventions while you're here!
SK1006,586,As you can see, I made all kindsa stuff.
SK1006,587,You've really loved machines for a long time, haven't you?
SK1006,588,Yeah. I'd get caught up building these and stay up all night.
SK1006,589,In the end, most of these were total failures...
SK1006,590,But it's thanks to all that passion and all those failures that I am who I am today.
SK1006,591,Kohran...
SK1006,592,Hey, Kohran, I brought ya somethin' nice.
SK1006,593,Wow... Now this brings me back.
SK1006,594,What's that watch?
SK1006,595,It's the pocket watch Kohran keeps as a memento of her father.
SK1006,596,She asked me to take very good care of it.
SK1006,597,This is where my love for messing with machines began.
SK1006,598,This watch is real important to me.
SK1006,599,It's the watch that saved my life, after all.
SK1006,600,The watch... saved your life?
SK1006,601,Yep. Back when my village was attacked by bandits...
SK1006,602,I was shot at by a rifle, but the watch took the bullet instead. It saved me...
SK1006,603,It was your father protecting you.
SK1006,604,What a crazy coincidence.
SK1006,605,It must've been your father protecting you.
SK1006,606,...Yeah. I think so, too.
SK1006,607,Wow... What a crazy coincidence.
SK1006,608,Heheh, well, I guess you could call it a coincidence.
SK1006,609,But I like to think it was my dad trying to protect me.
SK1006,610,Sorry for getting so serious outta nowhere.
SK1006,611,When I moved to the theater, I left it here with the rest of my inventions.
SK1006,612,I wanted to start fresh, from square one.
SK1006,613,But all my inventing started here, with this little watch.
SK1006,614,Kohran...
SK1006,615,Oh yeah, Pops, lemme show you the cinematron.
SK1006,616,Oh, that's the communicator you wrote about in your letters, right? I absolutely must see it!
SK1006,617,Here you go, Kohran, the cinematron.
SK1006,618,Thanks a bunch. Now, this beauty lets you talk to people while being able to look at their faces.
SK1006,619,Once you receive a transmission, it'll start ringing...
SK1006,620,Whoa! Th-That scared me!
SK1006,621,The cinematron's getting a call!
SK1006,622,What the heck could it be? Let's answer it, quick!
SK1006,623,Ogami? Thank goodness, I finally got through.
SK1006,624,Kaede! What on earth is going on?!
SK1006,625,We have an emergency.<br>Hostiles have been sighted in Ouji!
SK1006,626,Wha... What did you just say?!
SK1006,627,We still don't know all the details. The rest of the Flower Division have already deployed.
SK1006,628,The Soaring Whale is en route to your location. Return here ASAP!
SK1006,629,Get back to the theater immediately, you two!
SK1006,630,Roger, ma'am!
SK1006,631,Sounds like a real mess, Chief.
SK1006,632,Yeah. We have to get back to the capital, pronto.
SK1006,633,Hey, Pops... I was hoping to stick around a bit longer, but...
SK1006,634,I gotta go back. I'm real sorry.
SK1006,635,Kohran...
SK1006,636,Ya better not die. Ya gotta keep living.
SK1006,637,Keep living so that you can keep making all kindsa new things.
SK1006,638,Making people happy with the things you make...
SK1006,639,Is the greatest joy an inventor can know.
SK1006,640,Howard...
SK1006,641,Howard, Chief, I'm gonna go for it!
SK1006,642,Coming here today helped me remember where I came from.
SK1006,643,I'm gonna keep on making all sorts of great stuff!
SK1006,644,That's why I'm not gonna lose... I CAN'T lose!
SK1006,645,Kohran...
SK1006,646,All right, let's go!
SK1006,647,I'll protect you, Kohran!
SK1006,648,All right, let's go! To protect the capital... the Flower Division!
SK1006,649,And to protect our future!
SK1006,650,Yeah! Let's do this, Chief!
SK1006,651,I swear I'll protect you, Kohran!
SK1006,652,That way you can keep on inventing lots of things from here on out!
SK1006,653,Chief... Thanks a bunch! With you around, I'm not scared of nothin'!
SK1006,654,There's nothing left to say, Kohran.
SK1006,655,We're gonna win this fight and go home, like we always do!
SK1006,656,Yeah! Let's do this, Chief!
SK1006,657,No matter who we're up against, we'll never lose! That's what the Imperial Assault Troupe's all about!
SK1006,658,I'm so sorry, you two. You left because you were trying to be considerate, right?
SK1006,659,No, it's fine. I just needed to talk to Ensign about something.
SK1006,660,By the way, Ogami. Do you remember the promise you made?
SK1006,661,Yes, I remember.
SK1006,662,What promise?
SK1006,663,Yes, I remember.
SK1006,664,You mean the promise we made to model for one of your portraits, right?
SK1006,665,Yes, that's the one. I'm glad you remembered.
SK1006,666,What promise? Do you know what he's talking about, Orihime?
SK1006,667,Don't tell me you forgot already! We promised we'd model for one of his portraits, remember?!
SK1006,668,Oh, that's right! I remember now.
SK1006,669,Sheesh! You shouldn't forget such an important promise!
SK1006,670,Now now, Orihime, it WAS over a month ago, it's perfectly understandable.
SK1006,671,Hmmm... I'm not sure if I do remember it or not...
SK1006,672,Seriously, Ensign, you have nessuna memoria, no memory at all!
SK1006,673,We promised we'd model for one of his portraits, remember?!
SK1006,674,Oh yeah, that's right! I finally remembered.
SK1006,675,You shouldn't forget such an important promise!
SK1006,676,Now now, Orihime, it WAS over a month ago, it's perfectly understandable.
SK1006,677,I'll ask you again, Ogami.
SK1006,678,Would you and Orihime model for me?
SK1006,679,Yes, with pleasure.
SK1006,680,I... can't.
SK1006,681,Yes, with pleasure.
SK1006,682,...Do we have to be nude?
SK1006,683,I... can't.
SK1006,684,Yes, with pleasure.
SK1006,685,I'm OK with it too, of course!
SK1006,686,Thanks, you two.
SK1006,687,I... can't do it. I don't have what it takes.
SK1006,688,No, that's not true. You and Orihime have a certain... radiance about you.
SK1006,689,...Radiance?
SK1006,690,When a person's accomplished something, they shine brightly.
SK1006,691,Seeing you two now...  I want to capture that radiance in my art.
SK1006,692,Please, Ogami.
SK1006,693,How can you say no after all that, Ensign?
SK1006,694,...All right, I get it, Orihime.
SK1006,695,Mr. Ogata, I'd be more than happy to model for you.
SK1006,696,Oh, so you'll do it, then? Thank you.
SK1006,697,When you say "modeling"... Does that mean we have to be nude?
SK1006,698,E-Ensign! What are you saying?!
SK1006,699,What makes you think we'd do that here where a bunch of strangers can see us?!
SK1006,700,I-I see. You've got a point.
SK1006,701,Hahaha... You're as entertaining as ever, Ogami.
SK1006,702,Don't worry, the way you are right now will do just fine.
SK1006,703,Hmmm... What should I do?
SK1006,704,What are you hesitating for, Ensign?
SK1006,705,You and I are perfectly qualified to be models!
SK1006,706,Wow, Orihime... That's some confidence.
SK1006,707,All right then, Orihime, if you could sit in that chair over there.
SK1006,708,Ogami, you stand next to the chair.
SK1006,709,OK, got it.
SK1006,710,Good, Orihime, let's go with that expression.
SK1006,711,Now, what expression should I have you do, Ogami...
SK1006,712,(Expression?)
SK1006,713,Look natural.
SK1006,714,Flash a toothy smile.
SK1006,715,Put on a gallant expression.
SK1006,716,Look natural.
SK1006,717,Flash a toothy smile.
SK1006,718,Smile with your whole face.
SK1006,719,(Maybe I should just stick with a natural expression?)
SK1006,720,That's a good expression, Ogami.
SK1006,721,Yes, you look your best with your usual, natural expression. Wouldn't you agree, Carino?
SK1006,722,Yes, I think it perfectly conveys his personality.
SK1006,723,(I should probably smile, right?)
SK1006,724,Hmm... That smile seems a bit forced.
SK1006,725,I... I see...
SK1006,726,I think you should just act natural, look how you always do.
SK1006,727,...Like this?
SK1006,728,Yes, that's it! It perfectly conveys your sincere personality.
SK1006,729,(Maybe an expression like this, befitting the captain of the Flower Division!)
SK1006,730,O-Ogami... That expression's a bit much.
SK1006,731,R-Really? Did I overdo it?
SK1006,732,What if you put on your usual, natural expression instead?
SK1006,733,...Like this?
SK1006,734,Yes, that's it! It perfectly conveys your sincere personality.
SK1006,735,(All right, might as well smile with my whole face, then.)
SK1006,736,H-How's this?
SK1006,737,O-Ogami... Your face is twitching.
SK1006,738,Oh, s-sorry. I thought I'd try smiling...
SK1006,739,What if you put on your usual, natural expression instead?
SK1006,740,...Like this?
SK1006,741,Yes, that's it! It perfectly conveys your sincere personality.
SK1006,742,(Hmm... What kind of expression should I go with?)
SK1006,743,That's a good expression, Ogami.
SK1006,744,Yes, it perfectly conveys his natural charm.
SK1006,745,I... I see...
SK1006,746,All right, we'll go with this. Now then, you two, stay just like that.
SK1006,747,OK, got it.
SK1006,748,Papa! Draw me extra beautiful, OK?
SK1006,749,Ensign...
SK1006,750,Hm? What is it?
SK1006,751,Modeling for one of Papa's pictures with you like this...
SK1006,752,It feels so... enigmatic.
SK1006,753,...
SK1006,754,Why are you talking like that, Orihime?
SK1006,755,I was thinking... I want to be like Mamma...
SK1006,756,Someone who can shine in front of the people I love, like she does.
SK1006,757,So I figured I'd try to use prettier words... More beautiful language around you, Ensign.
SK1006,758,Orihime...
SK1006,759,You're fine the way you are.
SK1006,760,Thank you, that makes me happy.
SK1006,761,I appreciate it, but the way you normally talk is fine the way it is.
SK1006,762,I'll admit, I was pretty surprised by it at first...
SK1006,763,But I'm totally used to it now. The way you normally talk suits you better, Orihime.
SK1006,764,Ensign...
SK1006,765,You don't have to try so hard for my sake. Just be yourself.
SK1006,766,Ensign... Thank you!
SK1006,767,Thank you, that makes me happy.
SK1006,768,Hm hm, if you're happy, then I'm happy too... Happy as well.
SK1006,769,Don't wear yourself out over it, though, OK?
SK1006,770,Non preoccupatevi! I mean, relaaaax! No, wait, I mean...
SK1006,771,Orihime... You really don't have to go that far.
SK1006,772,I like you just the way you always are.
SK1006,773,R-Really? Thank you.
SK1006,774,Ensign... You don't like it?
SK1006,775,W-Well, it's just... Kind of weird.
SK1006,776,Hmph! You don't understand women at all, Ensign!
SK1006,777,Well fine! I'll just go back to talking the way I usually do.
SK1006,778,All right, that'll do for now.
SK1006,779,Great work, you two. You were excellent.
SK1006,780,Really? Heehee, I can't wait for the finished piece!
SK1006,781,Today was just the sketch. I still need to color it, refine it... There's still a ways to go.
SK1006,782,Huh? But I wanna see it now!
SK1006,783,Hahaha, come on, Orihime, we can wait and have something to look forward to.
SK1006,784,...!
SK1006,785,Oh? What's that noise?
SK1006,786,Ensign! Could that be...?
SK1006,787,Yeah. That's the cinematron ringing.
SK1006,788,Let's bring it out and see what's up!
SK1006,789,Ogami? Thank goodness, I finally got through.
SK1006,790,Kaede! What on earth is going on?!
SK1006,791,We have an emergency.<br>Hostiles have been sighted in Ouji!
SK1006,792,Wha... What did you just say?!
SK1006,793,We still don't know all the details. The rest of the Flower Division have already deployed.
SK1006,794,The Soaring Whale is en route to your location. Return here ASAP!
SK1006,795,Get back to the theater immediately, you two!
SK1006,796,Roger, ma'am!
SK1006,797,Ensign, we have to go, quickly!
SK1006,798,I don't know who these guys think they are...
SK1006,799,But I'm going to slap whoever decided to interrupt my papa and mamma's long-awaited reunion!
SK1006,800,Yeah. We have to regroup with the Flower Division, stat.
SK1006,801,...So you're leaving, Orihime?
SK1006,802,Yes, Papa.
SK1006,803,I won't stop you. This is the path you've chosen.
SK1006,804,However, my portrait is still incomplete.
SK1006,805,Seeing as you modeled for it, you'll need to be there to see the finished piece.
SK1006,806,Papa...
SK1006,807,Orihime... Make sure you come back with Ogami.
SK1006,808,You're our most precious treasure. You realize that, right?
SK1006,809,Yes, Mamma!
SK1006,810,Please look after Orihime for me, Ogami.
SK1006,811,And for me as well. Please... Please take care of her.
SK1006,812,Leave it to me.
SK1006,813,Can't wait to see the picture.
SK1006,814,Just leave it to me, sir. I'll protect Orihime, no matter what!
SK1006,815,Ensign... Thank you!
SK1006,816,Papa, Mamma, I'll be fine. The Ensign is with me!
SK1006,817,Let's go, Orihime. Everyone's waiting for us.
SK1006,818,Roger that! All right Papa, Mamma, I'll see you later!
SK1006,819,I can't wait to see the finished picture, Mr. Ogata.
SK1006,820,...Yes, of course! Look forward to it!
SK1006,821,I can't wait to see our picture, either.
SK1006,822,Yeah, but before that, we've got a job to do.
SK1006,823,Roger that! All right Papa, Mamma, I'll see you later!
SK1006,824,Papa, Mamma... You don't have to worry about me.
SK1006,825,We'll be coming back together! Isn't that right, Ensign?
SK1006,826,Yeah. All right, let's go, Orihime!
SK1006,827,Roger that! All right Papa, Mamma, I'll see you later!
SK1006,828,Now that we're done with the shrine, why don't we take a walk around the outer grounds?
SK1006,829,OK.
SK1006,830,...
SK1006,831,Reni...
SK1006,832,Are you not having fun?
SK1006,833,Are you tired?
SK1006,834,Why are you being so quiet?
SK1006,835,Reni? Are you not having fun?
SK1006,836,Huh? Why do you ask?
SK1006,837,No, it's just... You seem kind of down.
SK1006,838,I was thinking maybe you weren't enjoying yourself...
SK1006,839,No, that's not it.
SK1006,840,OK... So then why are you...
SK1006,841,Reni? Are you tired?
SK1006,842,Huh? Why do you ask?
SK1006,843,No, it's just... You seem kind of down.
SK1006,844,I was thinking maybe the New Year's crowd wore you out or something.
SK1006,845,No, that's not it.
SK1006,846,OK... So then why are you...
SK1006,847,Why are you being so quiet?
SK1006,848,Ah... Sorry for not answering.
SK1006,849,What's the matter, Reni?
SK1006,850,...
SK1006,851,I was just thinking... Is this what it's like to have fun?
SK1006,852,Huh?
SK1006,853,I have this feeling of satisfaction from getting to see so many new things.
SK1006,854,And on top of that... This is the first time I've gone out with you.
SK1006,855,Reni...
SK1006,856,We still have time before we have to go back to the theater, right, Captain?
SK1006,857,Yeah, you're right. All right, let's go for a little walk before we go.
SK1006,858,...Captain, look!
SK1006,859,Oh no! That girl's going to fall into the pond!
SK1006,860,She's going too fast, she won't be able to stop on her own!
SK1006,861,Jump over and save her!
SK1006,862,We have to save her, Reni. Let's get over to the shore!
SK1006,863,Roger!
SK1006,864,Crap, hope we can make it in time!
SK1006,865,I'll go help her! Someone has to save her!
SK1006,866,Reni...
SK1006,867,Damnmit! Guess I've got no choice but to go save her, too!
SK1006,868,Crap, hope we can make it in time!
SK1006,869,Hahhhh!
SK1006,870,Captain?!
SK1006,871,H-Huh? That might've been a little... too much... force.
SK1006,872,Whoooooa!
SK1006,873,Captain!
SK1006,874,Achoo!
SK1006,875,Are you all right, sir?
SK1006,876,Yeah... I'm fine, somehow.
SK1006,877,Hahaha... So I guess that's what the fortune meant by "beware of drowning", huh?
SK1006,878,Hahaha, but "after bad luck comes good fortune", right?
SK1006,879,Reni...
SK1006,880,Hahahaha...
SK1006,881,Hahahaha...
SK1006,882,Good grief... Even my fortune made a fool of me.
SK1006,883,...
SK1006,884,But there are two good things that came from it.
SK1006,885,What?
SK1006,886,First, I saved that girl.
SK1006,887,And saving people's my job, after all.
SK1006,888,...
SK1006,889,Back there, my body started moving without thinking.
SK1006,890,Before I knew it, I was running... Trying to save that girl.
SK1006,891,...
SK1006,892,I used to never think about saving other people.
SK1006,893,I was content only to fight. Nothing else around me mattered.
SK1006,894,And so, I never expected to get any help, either. The only one I could rely on was myself.
SK1006,895,...
SK1006,896,I was alone my entire life. I had no friends, no family... Nobody.
SK1006,897,But... Things are different now. I'm surrounded by people I care about.
SK1006,898,Reni...
SK1006,899,I'll protect you, Reni.
SK1006,900,So you'll protect me, too?
SK1006,901,I'll protect you Reni.
SK1006,902,Because I care about you too.
SK1006,903,Captain...
SK1006,904,So will you protect me too, then?
SK1006,905,Of course, isn't that obvious?
SK1006,906,I see... Thanks, Reni.
SK1006,907,I know how you feel, Reni.
SK1006,908,You don't need to say anything. Let's just stay like this a while.
SK1006,909,...Yeah.
SK1006,910,By the way, what was the other good thing?
SK1006,911,The second good thing was... being able to see your smile.
SK1006,912,Captain...
SK1006,913,...!
SK1006,914,Wh-What's going on?! An earthquake?!
SK1006,915,No... This isn't an earthquake. Powerful waves of energy are coming out of the ground.
SK1006,916,Not a mere earthquake, huh?
SK1006,917,Let's hurry back to the theater, Reni. We have to declare an emergency alert!
SK1006,918,Roger!
SK1006,919,Ogami, Reni, reporting for duty!
SK1006,920,What the hell just happened, Kaede?
SK1006,921,We have an emergency, Ogami. Hostiles have appeared in Ouji.
SK1006,922,Hostiles?! Who could it be?! The Black Demons are gone...
SK1006,923,...I don't know.
SK1006,924,I contacted all the other Flower Division members via cinematron and told them to come back.
SK1006,925,They've already deployed via the Thunderstrike.
SK1006,926,Got it. Let's move out too, Reni.
SK1006,927,I'm ready whenever.
SK1006,928,All right, Kaede, we'll be going.
SK1006,929,OK. Be careful.
SK1006,930,Tenbu startup preparations complete! Ready to go whenever.
SK1006,931,...Captain.
SK1006,932,Reni? What's up?
SK1006,933,We had to cut our shrine visit short to get back to the theater, but...
SK1006,934,Maybe we should... go somewhere together again sometime.
SK1006,935,Reni...
SK1006,936,Yeah, we will!
SK1006,937,We've got a job to do first.
SK1006,938,Yeah, we will! I promise, Reni.
SK1006,939,Let's see... Maybe next time we can dress in yukata and visit a festival?
SK1006,940,Captain... Thanks.
SK1006,941,First things first, we've got a job to do before we can think about that.
SK1006,942,Otherwise, they'll just keep interrupting us like they did today.
SK1006,943,...Yeah, you're right.
SK1006,944,Do you really need me to answer that?
SK1006,945,Of course we will, Reni.
SK1006,946,OK... Thanks.
SK1006,947,And that's why we're gonna make it back to the theater alive, Reni.
SK1006,948,Roger!
SK1006,949,OK, Tenbu online!<br>Destination, Ouji!
SK1006,950,Ogami, Reni, moving out!
SK1006,951,Sorry, Ogami, but each customer is only allowed to purchase one photo at a time.

SK1006,1022,6. Kyogoku Alive
SK1006,1023,... "" "" () - . , ! ? ?! !!
SK1007,1,Kyogoku... How are you still alive?!
SK1007,2,Didn't you kill yourself after the coup was put down?!
SK1007,3,I thought you already took responsibility for that failure.
SK1007,4,The Taisho Restoration was nothing more than just a diversion. My true goals are more paramount than something like that.
SK1007,5,Then, the man who committed suicide must be...
SK1007,6,A decoy...
SK1007,7,I get it... It was his body double!
SK1007,8,This torii gate...<br>Kyogoku! What exactly are you up to?
SK1007,9,Once the seal is released, the power of all these vengeful spirits shall rise again.
SK1007,10,All in order to return Tokyo to what it should be. It will be a purification, so to speak.
SK1007,11,W-What?!
SK1007,12,I won't let you!
SK1007,13,Return to what?
SK1007,14,I won't let you! You will not act as you please!
SK1007,15,You won't let me... Hmmph, know your place, Ogami!
SK1007,16,Return Tokyo to what it should be?
SK1007,17,You fools who are unware of Tokyo's true nature, still defending the city like this.
SK1007,18,I don't blame your ignorance. However, to not desire the truth is a grave sin.
SK1007,19,...
SK1007,20,You seem to know a little. Scared beyond words, aren't you?
SK1007,21,I admit that you have some strength. However, that's all you will ever have.
SK1007,22,Once the Octagram of Demonic Calling is unleashed, no one can prevent Tokyo from collapsing.
SK1007,23,We won't let you do as you like, Keigo Kyogoku! Begone!
SK1007,24,I shall not let you touch Lord Kyogoku! Your lives are now at my disposal!
SK1007,25,...T-That stance!
SK1007,26,Sakura, what's wrong?
SK1007,27,No... It can't be...
SK1007,28,But, that stance...<br>Father...<br>That has to be my father!!
SK1007,29,Wh-What?! The Demon King is... your father?!
SK1007,30,...
SK1007,31,Demon King! Is that... Is that true?!
SK1007,32,Are you Sakura's father?!
SK1007,33,...
SK1007,34,No... This is ridiculous!!
SK1007,35,The time is nigh. All that's left is to unleash the Octagram.
SK1007,36,I'll reveal your true form, Tokyo! I, Kyogoku, shall harness all of the regret and resentment!
SK1007,37,Rise, Musashi! Come and reveal your might!
SK1007,38,Aaaaaahhh!!
SK1007,39,W-What in the-?! Look out! The ground is splitting apart!
SK1007,40,Dammit... Just what... What in the world is happening?!
SK1007,41,Oh, Musashi, the great cocoon that will return this cursed Tokyo to its original state.
SK1007,42,The raging torrent of power released shall swallow everything...
SK1007,43,The great will that lies dormant in its womb, shall awaken! For I, Kyogoku!
SK1007,44,Oh, Musashi, the great cocoon that will return this cursed Tokyo to its original state.
SK1007,45,The raging torrent of power released shall swallow everything...
SK1007,46,The great will that lies dormant in its womb, shall awaken! For I, Kyogoku!
SK1007,47,False Tokyo... It is time to rip off your accursed mask!
SK1007,48,Now things have been set in motion. This cursed city shall shed its facade...
SK1007,49,And the true Tokyo shall rise at last! Hahahahaha!
SK1007,50,Sorry, Ogami, but each customer is only allowed to purchase one photo at a time.

SK1007,111,6. Kyogoku Alive
SK1007,112,... "" "" () - . , ! ? ?! !!
SK1101,1,Om maitrashti svaha...<br>Om maitrashti svaha...<br>Om maitrashti svaha...
SK1101,2,Kouma... Burn the capital to ash.
SK1101,3,True purification begins with destruction.
SK1101,4,Every man-made thing that makes Tokyo fake shall be destroyed... 
SK1101,5,...by Musashi.
SK1101,6,Om maitrashti svaha. <br>Om maitrashti svaha. <br>Om maitrashti svaha.
SK1101,7,Oh, Musashi, the seal of old Tokyo has been released.
SK1101,8,You may have this vengeful power that has just been set free.
SK1101,9,Destroy everything.
SK1101,10,And so forth, the true Tokyo will be born!
SK1101,11,To think that Kyogoku was actually alive...
SK1101,12,When the coup de'tat failed, the body they found must have been his double. 
SK1101,13,Damn him. He used the coup as cover while he went underground...
SK1101,14,And used that as a chance to revive Musashi.
SK1101,15,Kouma are coming out in droves...
SK1101,16,And those creeps from the Black Demon Society are still alive, too!
SK1101,17,On top of that, to think that Demon King is actually Sakura's father...
SK1101,18,...
SK1101,19,...
SK1101,20,Now's not the time to panic. In a situation like this, we need to stay calm.
SK1101,21,Understand the situation and analyze it calmly. There we'll find a way.
SK1101,22,True. For now, organizing all available information should come first.
SK1101,23,Hm. Ogami, is there anything you'd like to ask?
SK1101,24,Ask about the Octagram.
SK1101,25,Ask about Musashi.
SK1101,26,Ask about the Kouma.
SK1101,27,I'd like to ask about the "Octagram of Demonic Calling" they mentioned earlier
SK1101,28,This is all just conjecture, but here's my theory.
SK1101,29,This is a recent map of Tokyo.
SK1101,30,And here are the locations of our battles with the Black Demon Society.
SK1101,31,T-This is... All of these locations form an octagon!
SK1101,32,Furthermore, there's another one thing in common with these places.
SK1101,33,The torii gates.
SK1101,34,Torii gates...
SK1101,35,Yes. Those gates were always present whenever we got into a battle with them.
SK1101,36,Torii gates? Uh... Were they always there?
SK1101,37,Well... I remember now. There was a torii when we fought them at the restaurant in Fukagawa!
SK1101,38,Ikebukuro, Asakusa... There were torii gates there as well.
SK1101,39,It's possible that they're the keys to casting the Octagram.
SK1101,40,I believe that the Octagram of Demonic Calling is a spell to release spirit energy into Tokyo.
SK1101,41,Looks like the Black Demon Society attacked Tokyo in order to reveal those gates... 
SK1101,42,And to prepare the ritual.
SK1101,43,Damn! If only we realized it sooner!
SK1101,44,About the huge thing that Kyogoku called "Musashi"...
SK1101,45,Hmm... Honestly, I have no clue about that.
SK1101,46,However, as you all probably sensed yourselves, it's a huge mass of evil will.
SK1101,47,It's possibly even worse than the Sacred Demon Castle that surfaced two years ago.
SK1101,48,Yeah. I felt really sick when I saw that thing.
SK1101,49,That said, how do we stop something we know so little about?
SK1101,50,Right. It seems that we have no choice but to apprehend Kyogoku and question him.
SK1101,51,He must know about Musashi's origins...
SK1101,52,Seeing as he can summon an enormous being like that.
SK1101,53,Based on the Moon Division's intel, it seems that Kyogoku is a descendant of a legendary diviner.
SK1101,54,I see. So that's why he can cast a powerful spell like that.
SK1101,55,How were they controlling Kouma?
SK1101,56,Hmm... I had heard rumors.
SK1101,57,During the Kouma War, the Army secretly collected the Kouma we had defeated...
SK1101,58,They were using them for experiments in order to create "artificial Kouma."
SK1101,59,What?! What did they intend to do with them?!
SK1101,60,Kouma enhanced with machinery would make formidable weapons.
SK1101,61,They'd suffer neither fear nor fatigue. Standard weaponry can't touch them, and they could be mass produced.
SK1101,62,B-But... Why would the Army developed such a gruesome project?
SK1101,63,It's Kyogoku's doing. Mechanized Kouma, the Black Demon Society... All of them are part of his scheme.
SK1101,64,Perhaps, Yamazaki's death and the Revolutionary Army's coup...
SK1101,65,All of those things just petty distractions so he could get to work.
SK1101,66,Damn that Kyogoku!
SK1101,67,What are we gonna do now, Mon Frère?
SK1101,68,If this goes on... Are we gonna lose to the bad guys?
SK1101,69,We won't!
SK1101,70,Is there a way?
SK1101,71,If this keeps going...
SK1101,72,No, we won't lose! We're not going to let Tokyo burn to the ground!!
SK1101,73,But... How are we gonna fight those huge enemies?
SK1101,74,Well, you see...
SK1101,75,There must be... some way. It's too soon to give up.
SK1101,76,...Really? Is there really a way to fight them?
SK1101,77,If this keeps going...
SK1101,78,Are we... gonna die?
SK1101,79,...
SK1101,80,Mon Frère...
SK1101,81,Not to worry. We have a trump card for times like this.
SK1101,82,A... trump card?
SK1101,83,You're not saying...
SK1101,84,I am! The final trump card of the Imperial Assault Troupe that lies beneath Tokyo... 
SK1101,85,The Aerial Battleship Mikasa!!
SK1101,86,The Mikasa?! Wasn't it wrecked in our previous campaign?!
SK1101,87,Its bow remains in Tokyo Bay as a memorial park, after it pierced the Sacred Demon Castle.
SK1101,88,But, we recovered its hull after that battle. Since then, it had been undergoing secret reparations.
SK1101,89,Hence, we have a "Neo Mikasa"!
SK1101,90,Is that so?
SK1101,91,The Mikasa is currently undergoing final adjustments.
SK1101,92,As soon as they're complete, we'll board the ship and head for Musashi, where Kyogoku is waiting for us!
SK1101,93,Roger!
SK1101,94,Everyone, stand by at the theater until take-off. Now then, dismissed!
SK1101,95,The Aerial Battleship Mikasa, eh?  It's waiting for launch right beneath my feet.
SK1101,96,Our battle isn't over, Kyogoku.
SK1101,97,...Ogami.
SK1101,98,Sakura... Something wrong?
SK1101,99,There’s... something I want to talk to you about...
SK1101,100,About your father?
SK1101,101,About the battle?
SK1101,102,About me?
SK1101,103,About your father?
SK1101,104,Yes...
SK1101,105,About the battle?
SK1101,106,Yes... About that, and also...
SK1101,107,About my father...
SK1101,108,I see. It's about how Demon King might be your father, isn't it?
SK1101,109,...Yes.
SK1101,110,Is it... about me?
SK1101,111,No...
SK1101,112,It's about my father...
SK1101,113,Oh, I see. It's about how Demon King might be your father, isn't it?
SK1101,114,...Yes.
SK1101,115,Something you want to talk about? What is it?
SK1101,116,It's about my father...
SK1101,117,Oh, I see. It's about how Demon King might be your father, isn't it?
SK1101,118,...Yes.
SK1101,119,Uhm... In here, it's kind of... You know. How about we go outside?
SK1101,120,Got it. Let's go outside, then.
SK1101,121,Sakura, you were saying that Demon King is Colonel Shinguji, your father.
SK1101,122,Yes. That unique stance... He must be my father.
SK1101,123,Ogami, what should I do about this?
SK1101,124,Let's bring him back!
SK1101,125,Isn't he dead?
SK1101,126,Sakura, let's bring Colonel Shinguji's soul back to our side!
SK1101,127,Huh?!
SK1101,128,Kyogoku used a revival technique to revive him, just like with Major Yamazaki...
SK1101,129,And now Kyogoku is controlling him as the Demon King.
SK1101,130,If we break Kyogoku's spell. I'm sure we can turn him back to normal.
SK1101,131,Ogami, that's... 
SK1101,132,Yes! We just need to defeat Kyogoku with all our might!
SK1101,133,...Y-Yes.
SK1101,134,...
SK1101,135,Ogami, would you hear out my decision?
SK1101,136,But... isn't your father dead?
SK1101,137,I'm sure that Kyogoku used a some sort of revival spell to bring him back to life, just like Major Yamazaki.
SK1101,138,And now Kyogoku's controlling him.
SK1101,139,I see...
SK1101,140,...
SK1101,141,Ogami, would you hear out my decision?
SK1101,142,Hmm... What should you do about that, huh?
SK1101,143,I'm sorry... Asking you such a difficult question like that out of the blue.
SK1101,144,...
SK1101,145,I'm sure that my father is under Kyogoku's control.
SK1101,146,If we can break his spell, we can turn my father back to normal.
SK1101,147,I see...
SK1101,148,...
SK1101,149,Ogami, would you hear out my decision?
SK1101,150,I've made up my mind... to fight my father.
SK1101,151,Huh?! Sakura, why?!
SK1101,152,If his soul could've overcome Kyogoku, he would've freed himself long ago.
SK1101,153,But, even now, he continues to stand against us as the Demon King.
SK1101,154,What's more, every time we try to fight Kyogoku, he continually gets in the way.
SK1101,155,...
SK1101,156,That's why I'm going to cross swords with Father... To talk to him through the blade.
SK1101,157,That will surely liberate my Father's soul from Kyogoku's spell.
SK1101,158,Sakura...
SK1101,159,Thank you so much, Ogami. Talking with you feels like it's given me some extra resolve. 
SK1101,160,It's about time for the Mikasa to take off. Let's head inside.
SK1101,161,Yes.
SK1101,162,Skreeee!
SK1101,163,...?!
SK1101,164,That noise... Don't tell me...
SK1101,165,K-Kouma?!
SK1101,166,Damn it. They've finally launched their assault, huh?!
SK1101,167,Skreeee!
SK1101,168,Ogami, what should we do?!
SK1101,169,We'll fight!
SK1101,170,We'll retreat!
SK1101,171,Call for help!
SK1101,172,We'll fight them off, Sakura! We have to hold the Kouma off until the Mikasa can launch!
SK1101,173,But we won't last very long fighting them with just the two of us!
SK1101,174,Urgh... What are we gonna do?
SK1101,175,Let's run, Sakura! The two of us wouldn't last that long against that many of them.
SK1101,176,B-But if we run, they'll get inside the theater!
SK1101,177,We have to protect this place until the Mikasa can lift off!
SK1101,178,Urgh... What are we gonna do?
SK1101,179,I'll stop these Kouma. Sakura, call everyone to get down here!
SK1101,180,No way! Fighting them all by yourself is too dangerous!
SK1101,181,They'll get inside if I don't keep them back.
SK1101,182,Even so, I won't abandon you!
SK1101,183,Urgh... What are we gonna do?
SK1101,184,O-Ogami!!
SK1101,185,Skreeee!
SK1101,186,Urgh... What are we gonna do?
SK1101,187,Sorry to keep you waiting, Ogami!
SK1101,188,T-That voice...
SK1101,189,Ka... Kayama?!
SK1101,190,You can leave this to me and the boys of the Moon Division. Just get to the command room, Ogami. Hurry!
SK1101,191,B-But...
SK1101,192,Ogami, do you know what makes me happiest?
SK1101,193,A peaceful Tokyo.
SK1101,194,One where I'm able to protect the smiles in town.<br>Now go, Ogami.
SK1101,195,Kayama...
SK1101,196,Don't worry about me. We'll hold them off until the Mikasa can launch.
SK1101,197,We're counting on you, Kayama!
SK1101,198,Watch yourself!
SK1101,199,Kayama... We're counting on you!
SK1101,200,Got it, Ogami. Just make sure you beat Musashi!
SK1101,201,Roger!
SK1101,202,Come at me, Kouma! In the name of the Imperial Assault Troupe's Moon Division, I will not let you come one step further!
SK1101,203,Kayama...
SK1101,204,Watch yourself, Kayama! No matter how strong you are, fighting the Kouma all by yourself would be... 
SK1101,205,No need to worry, Ogami. I may not be piloting a spirit armor, but the Moon Division has ample battle experience.
SK1101,206,We may have fallen one step behind the enemy's plan...
SK1101,207,But I'll do my best to hold them here!
SK1101,208,Kayama...
SK1101,209,Kayama...
SK1101,210,Ogami...
SK1101,211,There's a saying I know, "prompt action brings success."
SK1101,212,Tokyo doesn't have much time left. You need to launch the Mikasa as soon as possible!!
SK1101,213,Run, Ogami! Run towards our victory!!
SK1101,214,Yeah. We'll meet again, Kayama!
SK1101,215,Let's go, Sakura!
SK1101,216,Roger!
SK1101,217,Commander Yoneda! Is the Mikasa go for launch?!
SK1101,218,...
SK1101,219,Final inspections for Mikasa are complete! All reports show we are clear for take-off!
SK1101,220,Evacuation of citizens on the launch ramp, complete!
SK1101,221,Commander Yoneda. Your next orders, please.
SK1101,222,...Commander Yoneda.
SK1101,223,...Mhmm.
SK1101,224,The future of Tokyo is in this Aerial Battleship Mikasa...
SK1101,225,And with it, the Imperial Assault Troupe.
SK1101,226,Starting now, we're to carry out the greatest mission on earth.
SK1101,227,Aerial Battleship Mikasa, take off!!
SK1101,228,300 seconds after launch, speed has leveled out!
SK1101,229,Our six main engines read all clear!
SK1101,230,All turret safety systems turned off. Switching to primary combat configuration.
SK1101,231,We did it! The Mikasa is finally flying!
SK1101,232,Let's not celebrate just yet, Ogami. We haven't even reached the target yet.
SK1101,233,The real battle starts right now.
SK1101,234,Roger!
SK1101,235,Commander Yoneda, your orders.
SK1101,236,Mhmm.
SK1101,237,Proceed to secondary combat positions.
SK1101,238,Proceeding to secondary combat positions.
SK1101,239,All main engines, increase output by 20%.
SK1101,240,All main engines, increasing output by 20%.
SK1101,241,Increase speed by 100 knots.
SK1101,242,Increasing speed by 100 knots.
SK1101,243,Kyougoku... We're not going to let you have Tokyo.
SK1101,244,Final destination is... Musashi!
SK1101,245,Final destination is... Musashi!
SK1101,246,The Imperial Navy, if we were to face off against the Kouma, would be but a candle in the wind against their might.
SK1101,247,At this rate, Tokyo's destruction will only be a matter of time.
SK1101,248,We have just one last ace in the hole.
SK1101,249,No one can stop Kyogoku's ambitions other than them.
SK1101,250,The Aerial Battleship Mikasa... And the Imperial Assault Troupe.
SK1101,251,Tokyo's future. We leave it up to you...
SK1101,252,OK. Mikasa has safely gotten into the air.
SK1101,253,Now, I'd like to discuss our plan of action.
SK1101,254,Oh yeah, time to have a duel with Musashi!
SK1101,255,Ogami, if it were up to you, how would you go about it?
SK1101,256,Bombardment from the Mikasa
SK1101,257,Attack its weak point
SK1101,258,Infiltrate it
SK1101,259,If it were up to me, I would conduct a bombardment using the Mikasa.
SK1101,260,Oh, nice. We'd be able to tout our big guns to see who's the strongest.
SK1101,261,Would the Mikasa's main cannon even be enough to take Musashi down?
SK1101,262,Uh... That's... 
SK1101,263,If it were up to me, I'd attack its weak point for massive amounts of damage.
SK1101,264,I see... That does sound like a good strategy.
SK1101,265,If only we knew where it was most vulnerable.
SK1101,266,Oh... Yeah. You're right about that.
SK1101,267,I would infiltrate Musashi and destroy it from the inside.
SK1101,268,Heh. So you're thinking about that too.
SK1101,269,...It's a dangerous strategy.
SK1101,270,But in order to defeat Musashi, there's no other way.
SK1101,271,Uh... To be honest, I haven't thought about it.
SK1101,272,Come on, Ogami. Get a grip.
SK1101,273,Just when we set the Mikasa to fly you have no strategy? You're better than that.
SK1101,274,You're from the navy, you should already have some ideas about how to deploy this battleship.
SK1101,275,R-Right.
SK1101,276,Now, let me explain the plan. Focus your attention towards the screen.
SK1101,277,After this briefing, the Mikasa will start to ascend.
SK1101,278,Eventually we'll reach the same altitude as Musashi, perfectly lined up to it.
SK1101,279,Then, we'll accelerate towards it at maximum power.
SK1101,280,When we reach maximum, we'll attack Musashi's face with our main cannon and force our way inside.
SK1101,281,Hey, hey, you're not saying we're gonna jam the whole ship into that thing, are you?
SK1101,282,Well, to put it simply, that's exactly what I'm saying.
SK1101,283,This is our only way to confront Musashi.
SK1101,284,Of course though, Kyogoku must have predicted that we'd be coming with the Mikasa.
SK1101,285,Whoops, seems we have some uninvited guests coming aboard.
SK1101,286,Kouma descending from high altitude! They're attacking the Mikasa's deck!
SK1101,287,Red alert! Kouma have infiltrated the engine room on both sides!
SK1101,288,If the engines get destroyed, the Mikasa will stall and be unable to maintain altitude!
SK1101,289,Tch... So they're also thinking of destroying us from the inside, huh?
SK1101,290,Ogami, time to move out! Divide the Flower Division into two groups of four and drive off the invaders in the engine room!
SK1101,291,Understood!
SK1101,292,Ogami, let me join you. Please!
SK1101,293,OK, join me!
SK1101,294,Take care of the other squad.
SK1101,295,OK, join me! I'm sure your power will be vital to our defense!
SK1101,296,Yes! I'll give it my all!
SK1101,297,Take care of the other squad. I need you to protect the other engine room.
SK1101,298,...Understood. I'll work with the second team.
SK1101,299,Please do your best leading your squad, Ogami.
SK1101,300,You're not going to leave me behind, are you, Ensign?
SK1101,301,Of course not!
SK1101,302,I leave the other team to you!
SK1101,303,Of course not! Let's go together, Sumire!
SK1101,304,Ohohohoho! Why of course!
SK1101,305,I'm leaving the other team in your hands! You have the power to protect that other engine room.
SK1101,306,For some reason I feel as if you're just saying that.
SK1101,307,But never mind. I will work with the other team.
SK1101,308,Captain, please let me join your team.
SK1101,309,I'm counting on you.
SK1101,310,Lead the other force.
SK1101,311,Yeah, I'm counting on you. Having you by my side will be reassuring.
SK1101,312,Understood. We will protect the Mikasa until the end.
SK1101,313,I need you to take care of the other team, Maria. Having you lead it would be a major boon.
SK1101,314,...Understood. I'll take care of the other detachment.
SK1101,315,Captain... Please take care.
SK1101,316,You're gonna bring me onto your outfit, right, Boss?
SK1101,317,Let's go together!
SK1101,318,Take care of the other team.
SK1101,319,Yeah, let's go together! In times like this, you'll be a great help.
SK1101,320,Now that's what I'm talking! I'll show the power of Kanna Kirishima!
SK1101,321,I need you to take care of the other unit, Kanna. Let's divide up our strength to drive off all our enemies.
SK1101,322,...OK. I'll do as you say, Boss.
SK1101,323,Leave the other team to me!
SK1101,324,Let me join you, Mon Frère!
SK1101,325,OK, got it.
SK1101,326,Iris, please be patient.
SK1101,327,OK, got it. Let's go together, Iris.
SK1101,328,Yay! I'm gonna work extra hard for you!
SK1101,329,Iris, please be patient. I need you to go with the second team.
SK1101,330,Whaaaat? So I can't go with you?!
SK1101,331,...Sorry, Iris. But I hope you understand.
SK1101,332,Hm... OK.
SK1101,333,You can take me anytime, Chief!
SK1101,334,Come with me!
SK1101,335,Take care of the second team.
SK1101,336,OK, Kohran. Come with me!
SK1101,337,You can count on me! The Mikasa is the crown jewel of this theater's technology. I absolutely won't let it crash!
SK1101,338,I need you to take care of the second team, Kohran. Please protect the other engine room.
SK1101,339,'Kay. Got it.
SK1101,340,I wanted to go with you, but... I'll give my all in the other detachment.
SK1101,341,Basic battles like this aren't my cup of tea, so what should I do?
SK1101,342,Wanna go together?
SK1101,343,Take care of the other team.
SK1101,344,If you'd like... would you like to go with me?
SK1101,345,I suppose I don't have any other options. If it's with Ensign though, sure thing.
SK1101,346,I need you to take care of the other team, Orihime.
SK1101,347,You're not choosing me, Ensign? What are you saying?
SK1101,348,I'll still help the others, but this does not sit well with me!
SK1101,349,...Captain. Your orders, please.
SK1101,350,Join my force.
SK1101,351,Take care of the second team.
SK1101,352,You're gonna join my team, Reni!
SK1101,353,...Understood.
SK1101,354,I need you to take care of the second unit, Reni.
SK1101,355,...Understood.
SK1101,356,Great, you're all set.

SK1101,365,You four, mobilize with Ogami. The other four will deploy as a separate team.
SK1101,366,Time to move out! Don't let the Mikasa get beaten by the likes of these Kouma!
SK1101,367,Roger!
SK1101,368,Sorry, Ogami, but each customer is only allowed to purchase one photo at a time.
SK1101,369,I see. That's too bad.
SK1101,370,My apologies, Ogami, but each customer is only allowed to purchase one photo at a time.

SK1102,1,We managed to drive back the Kouma in the engine room...
SK1102,2,But unfortunately, Tsuchigumo got away.
SK1102,3,Good work. Well, we'll consider defending the engine room a win.
SK1102,4,Sheesh... Can't even catch our breaths first.
SK1102,5,Multiple Kouma inbound from Musashi's direction!
SK1102,6,They're descending upon the deck, one after another!
SK1102,7,Those bastards... They've finally decided to attack the Mikasa directly, then.
SK1102,8,Commander! There's too many of them! We can't shoot them all down!
SK1102,9,The deck is being torn apart by the Kouma!
SK1102,10,Skreeee!!
SK1102,11,Commander! The Mikasa's air vent is on the deck!
SK1102,12,If they take out that vent, the Mikasa won't be able to maintain altitude!
SK1102,13,Move out, Ogami! Get on the deck and protect that vent!
SK1102,14,Understood!
SK1102,15,This is the moment of truth, isn't it?
SK1102,16,Understood!
SK1102,17,This is the moment of truth, isn't it?
SK1102,18,...Man, I'm tired.
SK1102,19,Understood! Moving out immediately!
SK1102,20,Good. We're counting on you, Ogami!
SK1102,21,This is the moment of truth, isn't it?
SK1102,22,Yes, it is. It's as hard for them as it is for us.
SK1102,23,...Man, I'm tired. I could use a break.
SK1102,24,Now's not the time, dumbass!
SK1102,25,If you don't deal with this right now, you'll be taking a break forever!
SK1102,26,R-Roger!
SK1102,27,Dammit, Ogami, what are you standing around for?!
SK1102,28,Snap out of it and get going!
SK1102,29,R-Roger!
SK1102,30,Ogami, the Kouma must have a limit to how high in altitude they can get before they cease to function.
SK1102,31,No matter how brutal their attacks get, you have to hold out.
SK1102,32,Understood.
SK1102,33,If we can make it through this, we'll finally make it to Musashi. Good luck, Ogami!
SK1102,34,Yes, ma'am!
SK1102,35,Sorry, Ogami, but each customer is only allowed to purchase one photo at a time.
SK1102,36,I see. That's too bad.

SK1102,104,... "" "" () - . , ! ? ?! !!
SK1104,1,How are you feeling, everyone?
SK1104,2,My head still hurts a little...
SK1104,3,The Tenbu are acting up. What's going on?
SK1104,4,...
SK1104,5,The problem lies with... the Tenbu themselves.
SK1104,6,What?! What are you talking about, Kohran?!
SK1104,7,Spirit armors work using the spirit power of their pilots.
SK1104,8,Naturally, that means the stronger the pilot, the stronger the spirit armor's output.
SK1104,9,But the Tenbu don't just use their pilots' spirit power...
SK1104,10,They absorb what we call "city energy" from veins deep in the earth, and use it as power.
SK1104,11,I see... So that's why they're so much stronger than the Koubu.
SK1104,12,The spiritometer on the bridge has been recording such high readings, the needle's ready to fly right off.
SK1104,13,It seems like the Octagram of Demonic Calling unleashed a ton of city energy...
SK1104,14,And Musashi's sucking it all up into the air over Tokyo.
SK1104,15,And in turn, the Tenbu are absorbing all that energy.
SK1104,16,At this rate, the Tenbu will go completely haywire... Rendering themselves and their pilots kaput.
SK1104,17,No... We've come so far, and now we can't use the Tenbu anymore?
SK1104,18,Mon Frère... What should we do?
SK1104,19,Abandon the Tenbu.
SK1104,20,Fight, even if it's risky!
SK1104,21,Give up.
SK1104,22,I can't let anyone put themselves at any further risk.
SK1104,23,But then... How are we gonna fight?
SK1104,24,Uh, well...
SK1104,25,We have to keep fighting, even if it's risky! The Tenbu's all we've got!
SK1104,26,Captain! If we do that, we'll all die before the battle's even begun!
SK1104,27,But what other choice do we have?!
SK1104,28,...We have to give up. There's nothing else we can do.
SK1104,29,Captain! What do you think you're doing, saying that?!
SK1104,30,But... what else CAN we do?
SK1104,31,Let's think this through. There's got to be something we can do.
SK1104,32,You're right. We'll come up with something, so long as we don't give up.
SK1104,33,Not to worry, everyone. We may not be able to ride the Tenbu anymore...
SK1104,34,But that's why I loaded all our Koubu Kai in the hangar, just for such an occasion!
SK1104,35,Plus, we've got Koubu for Orihime and Reni now, too!
SK1104,36,Huh?! Kohran, are you serious?!
SK1104,37,Yep, I never lie. You'll see once we get to the hangar.
SK1104,38,Yaaay! C'mon, everybody, let's go see the Koubu!
SK1104,39,It's true! The Koubu... They're all there, ready to go!
SK1104,40,The city energy won't have any effect on the Koubu.
SK1104,41,We should be able to fight within Musashi with no problems!
SK1104,42,The Tenbu fought hard for us.
SK1104,43,We have to fight our hardest in there, so that the Tenbu's efforts won't be in vain!
SK1104,44,Yeah, let's do our best!
SK1104,45,Won't we be weaker, though?
SK1104,46,Yeah, let's do our best, everyone! We've still got the Koubu!
SK1104,47,That's right. If the pilots are strong, then the Koubu are more than capable.
SK1104,48,We're all way stronger than we used to be! We've got a fighting chance!
SK1104,49,But... Won't we be weaker?
SK1104,50,With the Tenbu, we were finally on equal footing with the enemy. Will the Koubu really cut it?
SK1104,51,We'll be fine! If the pilots are strong, then the Koubu are more than capable.
SK1104,52,We're all way stronger than we used to be! We've got a fighting chance!
SK1104,53,...
SK1104,54,Chief, I know you might be worried about the Koubu...
SK1104,55,But if the pilots are strong, then the Koubu are more than capable.
SK1104,56,We're all way stronger than we used to be! We've got a fighting chance!
SK1104,57,Hey, everyone! If we could have your attention, please!
SK1104,58,Well, how do we look? We have Flower Division uniforms now, just like everyone else!
SK1104,59,Wow... Where did you get those?
SK1104,60,They had these made for us to go with our Koubu.
SK1104,61,It looks great on you.
SK1104,62,Now you're truly part of the team.
SK1104,63,It looks great on you two.
SK1104,64,...Thanks, Captain.
SK1104,65,Of course it does! There's not an outfit in the world that looks bad on me!
SK1104,66,With that, you two are now truly part of the Flower Division.
SK1104,67,...Yeah.
SK1104,68,Heehee, well said, Ensign!
SK1104,69,Heehee, I see you're speechless by how perfectly it fits, Ensign!
SK1104,70,We share the same spirit armor, the same uniform, and the same emotion.
SK1104,71,The Flower Division are now truly as one, wouldn't you say, Captain?
SK1104,72,Yeah. Now the real battle begins.
SK1104,73,Right then, let's get back to the bridge.
SK1104,74,Commander Yoneda's likely waiting for us.
SK1104,75,Good, you're all here.
SK1104,76,In one hour from now, the Mikasa will finally reach its destination.
SK1104,77,We'll ram into Musashi at full speed, and you'll destroy it from the inside. It'll be extremely difficult.
SK1104,78,I don't want to sugarcoat anything, so I'll be blunt.
SK1104,79,The odds of your success... are extremely low.
SK1104,80,Does... Does that mean we might die?
SK1104,81,To put it simply, yes.
SK1104,82,But at the same time, I believe in you.
SK1104,83,I believe that you'll come back from this.
SK1104,84,The future of the capital rests on your shoulders. We're all counting on you.
SK1104,85,Heheh, I'm tremblin' with excitement now.
SK1104,86,We'll show 'em what we're made of!
SK1104,87,Good. Now then, you're dismissed.
SK1104,88,Everyone get some rest and prepare yourselves for the infiltration mission!
SK1104,89,Yes, sir!
SK1104,90,(1 hour until the infiltration mission... The final battle's at hand.)
SK1104,91,Ogami.
SK1104,92,Kaede? What is it?
SK1104,93,It's almost time for the final battle.
SK1104,94,Like Commander Yoneda just said, this is likely to be a grueling battle.
SK1104,95,...Right.
SK1104,96,Everyone in the Flower Division's putting on a brave face right now...
SK1104,97,But I'm sure they must feel anxious, deep down.
SK1104,98,So please, Ogami, go talk to them.
SK1104,99,I know you'll be able to lift their spirits.
SK1104,100,Understood.
SK1104,101,What a pain...
SK1104,102,Understood. I'll be there to support them.
SK1104,103,Thank you, Ogami. I knew you'd say that.
SK1104,104,You mean I have to talk to everyone? What a pain...
SK1104,105,O-Ogami! What are you saying?
SK1104,106,Is that the attitude the captain of the Flower Division is supposed to have?!
SK1104,107,You have to be there for them at a time like this!
SK1104,108,Y-Yes, ma'am... Sorry.
SK1104,109,Hm hm, what's the matter, Ogami?
SK1104,110,N-Nothing, just... I don't know if I can do it.
SK1104,111,Hm hm, you're the captain of the Flower Division, aren't you? Keep it together.
SK1104,112,Now please, go talk to them, Ogami.
SK1104,113,Right, understood.
SK1104,114,Sakura...
SK1104,115,Oh, Ogami.
SK1104,116,What's the matter?
SK1104,117,Sorry, you shouldn't have to see me like this...
SK1104,118,...
SK1104,119,You're worried about your father, aren't you?
SK1104,120,...Yes. I'd be lying if I said I wasn't worried.
SK1104,121,My father taught me how to use a sword. I know how strong he is.
SK1104,122,When we fought in Shinjuku and Akasaka... I think he might've felt some hesitation back then.
SK1104,123,But now... I'm certain he'll be coming at me with everything he's got.
SK1104,124,...
SK1104,125,I have to defeat him. He's the Demon King now. He's not my father.
SK1104,126,If I defeat the Demon King... My father's soul will return. That's what I believe.
SK1104,127,You're right. We'll win this!
SK1104,128,We don't have a choice.
SK1104,129,You're right. We'll win this! No, we HAVE to win this!
SK1104,130,For your sake as well!
SK1104,131,Ogami...
SK1104,132,It'll be difficult, but... We don't have a choice.
SK1104,133,We have to believe in justice! We can't lose to evil!
SK1104,134,...Right.
SK1104,135,Ogami... I feel... lost. I don't know if I can defeat him...
SK1104,136,Sakura... I know you can win!
SK1104,137,And we'll all return to the theater, together!
SK1104,138,Ogami...
SK1104,139,You can do it, Sakura!
SK1104,140,Yes, sir!
SK1104,141,All right, go back to your quarters and rest up before the mission.
SK1104,142,OK. Thank you.
SK1104,143,I'll see you later, Ogami.
SK1104,144,Sakura... This must be so hard for her, but she's really trying her best.
SK1104,145,Right, I should get going too.
SK1104,146,I'm so glad you're here, Ogami.
SK1104,147,It's because you're here, that I...
SK1104,148,Sakura...
SK1104,149,Ogami...
SK1104,150,...
SK1104,151,Sometimes... I wonder.
SK1104,152,I wonder what things would be like if I had never met you.
SK1104,153,But no matter how much I think about it, I never come up with an answer.
SK1104,154,I can't imagine a world without you, Ogami.
SK1104,155,Sakura...
SK1104,156,So please, Ogami, stay with me...
SK1104,157,Stay with me... forever...
SK1104,158,Sumire. What are you doing in a place like this?
SK1104,159,...Huh?
SK1104,160,O-Oh, Ensign. How long have you been standing there?
SK1104,161,I just got here.
SK1104,162,I-Is that so? My apologies.
SK1104,163,I was just looking at this perfume catalog, and I was so caught up, I didn't notice you.
SK1104,164,But... that's a clothes catalog.
SK1104,165,...Huh? O-Oh my...
SK1104,166,...
SK1104,167,Are you nervous?
SK1104,168,This isn't like you.
SK1104,169,Are you nervous, Sumire?
SK1104,170,...
SK1104,171,Am I not allowed to be?
SK1104,172,...Huh?
SK1104,173,This isn't like you, Sumire.
SK1104,174,...
SK1104,175,What exactly do you mean by that?
SK1104,176,...Huh?
SK1104,177,Must I always be brave?
SK1104,178,Do you find it odd that I'm feeling nervous? Is that what you're trying to say?
SK1104,179,Sumire...
SK1104,180,...
SK1104,181,...
SK1104,182,Even I get nervous, sometimes.
SK1104,183,As a member of the Flower Division... As a woman... Even I feel nervous.
SK1104,184,...
SK1104,185,I'm sorry, Ensign. I didn't want you to see me like this.
SK1104,186,Sumire...
SK1104,187,I'll be all right now. I feel better having talked to you.
SK1104,188,Right then, I'll be taking my leave, Ensign.
SK1104,189,Sumire...
SK1104,190,I don't want to lose!
SK1104,191,I want to live and be with you, Ensign!
SK1104,192,Sumire...
SK1104,193,Ensign...
SK1104,194,I can... hear your heartbeat...
SK1104,195,We're going into battle. I'm nervous too, see?
SK1104,196,I don't want to die yet, either. I want to be with you.
SK1104,197,Ensign...
SK1104,198,Sumire, we're going to come back from this alive.
SK1104,199,We'll always be together. We're coming back from this, side by side.
SK1104,200,Yes, Ensign...
SK1104,201,We'll return from this... together.
SK1104,202,Right then, I'll be taking my leave.
SK1104,203,Sure. Go to your quarters and get some rest.
SK1104,204,...
SK1104,205,Ensign... I found a lovely outfit in this catalog.
SK1104,206,Perhaps when we get back... You could join me for some shopping?
SK1104,207,Of course, that sounds great.
SK1104,208,But I thought you said this was a perfume catalog.
SK1104,209,Goodness, Ensign! You're such a tease.
SK1104,210,Anyway, good day, Ensign.
SK1104,211,Right, I ought to get going, too.
SK1104,212,Ciao, Ensign!
SK1104,213,Hi, Orihime.
SK1104,214,Even in the Mikasa you're just wandering around, as usual.
SK1104,215,Can I guess what it is you're doing?
SK1104,216,Sure, go ahead.
SK1104,217,You're trying to cheer every one up. I'm right, aren't I?
SK1104,218,That's right, ya got me.
SK1104,219,I've gotten to know you pretty well, Ensign.
SK1104,220,Now it's your turn to guess.
SK1104,221,My turn?
SK1104,222,What do you think I was doing here?
SK1104,223,Getting a snack?
SK1104,224,Waiting for me?
SK1104,225,You have free time right now, so... I guess you were getting a snack?
SK1104,226,*sigh*<br>You're so clueless, Ensign.
SK1104,227,Even though I was waiting here this whole time to cheer you up...
SK1104,228,Huh? You waited for me?
SK1104,229,Could it be that you were waiting for me?
SK1104,230,Correct! Way to go, Ensign, you got it.
SK1104,231,Huh, really?
SK1104,232,Hmmm... Don't have a clue.
SK1104,233,Heehee, you're so clueless when it comes to these things, Ensign.
SK1104,234,I was waiting for you here so I could cheer you up.
SK1104,235,Huh? You waited for me?
SK1104,236,This battle's going to be the fiercest one we've ever fought.
SK1104,237,But I believe in you, that you'll lead us to victory.
SK1104,238,Orihime...
SK1104,239,The theater's become a very important place for me.
SK1104,240,Everyone in the Flower Division's important to me.
SK1104,241,Ensign... Let's make sure we all come back from this together.
SK1104,242,Yeah, of course. We're all coming back to the theater together.
SK1104,243,All right, Ensign, I'll be going now.
SK1104,244,Right. Get plenty of rest before the mission.
SK1104,245,You got it. Well, see you later!
SK1104,246,Ah, I forgot something very important!
SK1104,247,Something important? What is it?
SK1104,248,...Hm hm hm.
SK1104,249,*kiss*
SK1104,250,O... Orihime...
SK1104,251,That was for good luck.
SK1104,252,So that you make it through this alive...
SK1104,253,So that we can be together forever...
SK1104,254,A good luck charm from me.
SK1104,255,Orihime...
SK1104,256,All right, Ensign, I'll be going now.
SK1104,257,Right. Thanks for the good luck charm.
SK1104,258,It's our little secret, you got that?
SK1104,259,Orihime...
SK1104,260,Right, I should get going too.
SK1104,261,Looks like Sumire and Orihime have both gone back to their quarters.
SK1104,262,Right, I should go somewhere else.
SK1104,263,Ah, Captain...
SK1104,264,Maria, is that you? Were you thinking about something?
SK1104,265,Yes... Sitting here has made me remember a few things.
SK1104,266,Like the countless times we've deployed for battle from this very room.
SK1104,267,...
SK1104,268,Captain, do you feel confident about this battle?
SK1104,269,Do you think... we can win?
SK1104,270,Yeah, of course we can!
SK1104,271,It might be hard...
SK1104,272,Yeah, of course we can!
SK1104,273,If we combine all our strength, there's no way we can lose!
SK1104,274,...Yes. I think so too.
SK1104,275,It might be hard. Kyogoku's unlike any enemy we've ever faced before.
SK1104,276,To be frank... It'll probably be an uphill battle.
SK1104,277,Yes, it's just as you say.
SK1104,278,But with the way we are now... I have no doubt that we can win.
SK1104,279,We don't know what the enemy's capable of, so I can't really say.
SK1104,280,Discreet, just as I expected from you, sir.
SK1104,281,But with the way we are now... I have no doubt that we can win.
SK1104,282,The Flower Division's always overcome any hardship we've faced.
SK1104,283,We never gave up, even when all seemed lost, and we overcame all the obstacles.
SK1104,284,And it's all because we had our captain.
SK1104,285,It's because of you, sir, that we're all able to give 120%.
SK1104,286,...
SK1104,287,So long as all of us give this battle everything we've got, we can win.
SK1104,288,So long as you're with us, Captain... We WILL win.
SK1104,289,Maria...
SK1104,290,Maria. For the Flower Division, victory doesn't come with just winning the battle.
SK1104,291,Only when every single one of us comes home alive can we truly call it a victory.
SK1104,292,Yes, I know that. We will come back alive, every one of us.
SK1104,293,Yeah, we will.
SK1104,294,I'll be going now. Excuse me, Captain.
SK1104,295,We'll meet here again before the mission starts.
SK1104,296,Right, I should get going too.
SK1104,297,OK...
SK1104,298,...
SK1104,299,Captain... I have a favor to ask of you.
SK1104,300,What is it, Maria?
SK1104,301,Please don't leave me... Don't die.
SK1104,302,Make sure we come back from this alive together.
SK1104,303,I don't want this locket to become a memento too...
SK1104,304,Maria...
SK1104,305,I promise you, Maria. I won't die and leave you all alone.
SK1104,306,And I'm not going to let you die, either.
SK1104,307,When we go back, it'll be both of us together, along with the rest of the Flower Division.
SK1104,308,Sir... Thank you.
SK1104,309,By the way, do you still not feel like showing me what's in your locket?
SK1104,310,I'm sorry, but no matter how much you ask...
SK1104,311,Aw, that's not fair, Maria. I asked nicely and everything!
SK1104,312,Hm hm hm, forgive me, sir.
SK1104,313,I'll be going now. Excuse me, Captain.
SK1104,314,We'll meet here again before the mission starts.
SK1104,315,Maria...
SK1104,316,Right, I should get going too.
SK1104,317,Looks like Maria went back to her quarters.
SK1104,318,I should head somewhere else, myself.
SK1104,319,Oh, Boss! What's up?
SK1104,320,Just going around checking up on everyone.
SK1104,321,Kanna, were you exercising just now?
SK1104,322,Yeah. I just couldn't sit still.
SK1104,323,But... I'm having a hard time moving my body.
SK1104,324,Heheh, it's not like me to feel nervous, but I guess I am.
SK1104,325,Kanna...
SK1104,326,You should get some rest.
SK1104,327,Is there anything I can do?
SK1104,328,You should get some rest, Kanna. Our battle in Musashi's likely to be the hardest we've ever fought.
SK1104,329,...Yeah, you're right.
SK1104,330,Thanks, Boss. I feel a bit calmer now that I've talked with you.
SK1104,331,...I see.
SK1104,332,All right then, get plenty of rest, OK, Kanna?
SK1104,333,Is there anything I can do to help?
SK1104,334,I could talk with you, spar with you, whatever you need.
SK1104,335,Hahahaha! A sparring match sounds good right about now, but I'll have to pass.
SK1104,336,I'd feel bad about beating you to a pulp right before the final battle.
SK1104,337,Hahaha, you've got a point.
SK1104,338,Thanks, Boss. I feel a bit calmer now that I've talked with you.
SK1104,339,...I see.
SK1104,340,All right then, get plenty of rest, OK, Kanna?
SK1104,341,Haha, my bad. Didn't mean to make you worry.
SK1104,342,I'll be fine. I've always been able to pull it together when it counts.
SK1104,343,When the final battle comes, I'll show you what these fists of mine are capable of.
SK1104,344,I see. I'm looking forward to it, Kanna.
SK1104,345,Boss... Thanks.
SK1104,346,With you here, I feel confident in myself.
SK1104,347,With you here, I feel confident that I can't lose, no matter who I'm up against.
SK1104,348,Kanna...
SK1104,349,Get some rest before the mission, OK?
SK1104,350,Yeah. See ya, Boss.
SK1104,351,...
SK1104,352,Boss!
SK1104,353,Kanna?!
SK1104,354,Sorry if that was kinda sudden, Boss...
SK1104,355,But I just felt like doing this with you.
SK1104,356,...
SK1104,357,I've... never been good at expressing myself with words.
SK1104,358,I want to give you spiritual strength... The strength of an Unai.
SK1104,359,Kanna... Thanks.
SK1104,360,Boss...
SK1104,361,Right... I'm gonna get some rest for a bit.
SK1104,362,Yeah...
SK1104,363,...
SK1104,364,Let's make it back alive, Boss. Let's make it back together!
SK1104,365,Yeah. When it's time to go home, we're going back together.
SK1104,366,I swear I'll protect you, Kanna.
SK1104,367,And I'll protect you too. I'll protect my dear captain.
SK1104,368,Kanna...
SK1104,369,Kanna said she was going to take a rest, right?
SK1104,370,I'll leave her alone till it's time for the mission.
SK1104,371,Oh, Mon Frère...
SK1104,372,Iris? What's wrong? What are you doing here?
SK1104,373,...
SK1104,374,I was just... looking outside.
SK1104,375,It's not every day you get to see the top of the clouds like this, huh.
SK1104,376,I always thought that heaven was on top of the clouds.
SK1104,377,But where we're going... It's not heaven, is it?
SK1104,378,...
SK1104,379,If we die... Where do you think we'll go?
SK1104,380,Mon Frère... Do you know where heaven is?
SK1104,381,Who knows?
SK1104,382,We're not going to heaven yet.
SK1104,383,Who knows? Not me.
SK1104,384,I see... So you don't know either, huh...
SK1104,385,But if everyone knew where heaven was, everyone would be trying to go there, right?
SK1104,386,Then heaven would get overcrowded.
SK1104,387,Heheh... That's true.
SK1104,388,We're not going to heaven just yet. There's still all kinds of stuff you want to do, right, Iris?
SK1104,389,I... I want to go on a date with you.
SK1104,390,Hahaha, I see. Then it's way too early for us to go to heaven.
SK1104,391,...Yeah.
SK1104,392,Iris... You don't have to think about that sort of thing yet.
SK1104,393,We're still alive. We don't need to worry about being dead yet.
SK1104,394,Y-Yeah...
SK1104,395,So long as we're alive, there's all kinds of happy, fun things we can do.
SK1104,396,So don't think about dying, OK?
SK1104,397,OK, got it!
SK1104,398,I read in a book once that heaven was a place full of happiness.
SK1104,399,But I'm the happiest whenever I'm with you, Mon Frère.
SK1104,400,Iris...
SK1104,401,Thanks, Mon Frère. I feel a little better after talking with you.
SK1104,402,OK, I'm gonna go now. Bye-bye, Mon Frère!
SK1104,403,Heaven, huh...?
SK1104,404,Right, about time for me to go, too.
SK1104,405,Hey, Mon Frère? Could you... hug me?
SK1104,406,...Huh?
SK1104,407,I want you to hug me...
SK1104,408,...Yeah, sure.
SK1104,409,Heehee! Yaaaay!
SK1104,410,We'll be together forever, Mon Frère!
SK1104,411,Let's make sure we go home together.
SK1104,412,We're going home together no matter what!
SK1104,413,Yeah. No matter what.
SK1104,414,Uh-huh! That's a promise, Mon Frère.
SK1104,415,Thanks, Mon Frère. I'm gonna go now.
SK1104,416,All right, get some rest before the mission, OK?
SK1104,417,Okaaay! See you later, Mon Frère! Bye-byyye!
SK1104,418,Let's go on a date when we get back!
SK1104,419,Hahaha. So it's a date, huh?
SK1104,420,Right, I'd better get going.
SK1104,421,I can see the capital down below.
SK1104,422,We can't afford to lose. We have to defend the capital.
SK1104,423,Doesn't look like anyone's in the hangar. Guess I'll go somewhere else.
SK1104,424,Chieeef!
SK1104,425,That voice... Is that you, Kohran?
SK1104,426,Sorry I'm not in uniform, Chief. Been kinda busy.
SK1104,427,Kohran... Maintaining the Koubu, I take it?
SK1104,428,This final battle's gonna be the Koubu Kai's shining moment.
SK1104,429,I was just running one last inspection on these babies.
SK1104,430,I see...
SK1104,431,We can always count on you.
SK1104,432,Don't overdo it.
SK1104,433,I'm sure the Koubu will give it 120% now that you've serviced them.
SK1104,434,We can always count on you, Kohran.
SK1104,435,Aww, Chief... You don't need to say that.
SK1104,436,It's only cause you're here that I'm able to work this hard.
SK1104,437,Kohran, servicing the Koubu's all well and good, but don't overdo it, OK?
SK1104,438,I'll be fine. I always feel the most at ease when I'm fiddling around with machines.
SK1104,439,Working on the Koubu might even be more relaxing for me than resting in my room.
SK1104,440,Hahaha, I see, sounds about right for you.
SK1104,441,...Thanks for looking out for me, Chief. I mean it.
SK1104,442,I'm so happy you're there for me.
SK1104,443,What's wrong, Chief? You're looking kinda serious.
SK1104,444,Lemme guess, you're worried about the Koubu's power?
SK1104,445,No, that's not it...
SK1104,446,It's thanks to you we all got this far, Chief.
SK1104,447,It's thanks to you that we've grown and become stronger.
SK1104,448,The way we are now, we'll be able to squeeze out every last drop of the Koubu's power.
SK1104,449,Kohran...
SK1104,450,Wipe the oil from her face.
SK1104,451,Leave.
SK1104,452,Kohran, you've got a little oil on your face.
SK1104,453,Ah, Chief, you don't have to wipe it off for me or anything...
SK1104,454,It's fine, hold still.
SK1104,455,Chief...
SK1104,456,Your hand is so... warm.
SK1104,457,I hate to admit it, but as much as I love machines, they don't have the same warmth your hand does.
SK1104,458,It's because you're alive that your hand's so warm...
SK1104,459,And it's because I'm alive that I can feel that warmth.
SK1104,460,Kohran...
SK1104,461,Ogami... No matter what happens... Let's make it out of there alive.
SK1104,462,I want to keep feeling this warmth.
SK1104,463,Yeah. We will. We're getting out of there alive.
SK1104,464,Yeah.
SK1104,465,Ah... Ahahaha! Sorry for saying all that weird stuff, Chief.
SK1104,466,Right, well... Back to work, back to work.
SK1104,467,OK, I'll be going, then. Good luck with your maintenance, Kohran.
SK1104,468,All right, see ya later in the Command Room.
SK1104,469,Kohran must be working on the Koubu somewhere where I can't see her.
SK1104,470,I don't want to get in the way of her work, so I'll just get going.
SK1104,471,Hey, Reni. Were you resting in here?
SK1104,472,...Yeah.
SK1104,473,How do you like your new Flower Division uniform?
SK1104,474,...Yeah.
SK1104,475,...
SK1104,476,Reni...
SK1104,477,...
SK1104,478,I haven't been exercising at all, but my palms are drenched with sweat.
SK1104,479,My heart rate is also faster than usual.
SK1104,480,We're not even fighting yet... Have I gone crazy?
SK1104,481,Reni...
SK1104,482,You're not crazy at all.
SK1104,483,So even you feel nervous, Reni?
SK1104,484,You're not crazy at all. You're just feeling nervous.
SK1104,485,I'm... nervous?
SK1104,486,It's natural to feel nervous before entering a big battle like this.
SK1104,487,...
SK1104,488,So even you can feel nervous, huh, Reni?
SK1104,489,Nervous...
SK1104,490,The way your hands are sweaty and your pulse is higher, it must be because you're nervous.
SK1104,491,...
SK1104,492,I'd only ever read about this in books before.
SK1104,493,So this is what it's like... to be nervous.
SK1104,494,My present symptoms do seem to match.
SK1104,495,...
SK1104,496,I was thinking about a lot of things just now.
SK1104,497,What would happen if we lost... If we died...
SK1104,498,I'd never thought about that sort of thing before.
SK1104,499,And when I did... My heart rate got faster.
SK1104,500,That happens to me too whenever I think about losing a battle or dying.
SK1104,501,It's because I don't want to lose. Because I don't want to die.
SK1104,502,Because I don't want to be apart from the people I care about.
SK1104,503,...
SK1104,504,I... don't want to be apart from everyone, either.
SK1104,505,I don't want to lose. I don't want to die yet.
SK1104,506,It's all right, Reni. We won't lose, and we won't die.
SK1104,507,I'll protect everyone in the Flower Division... and you.
SK1104,508,Captain...
SK1104,509,I think the symptoms of my nervousness have cleared up.
SK1104,510,Hahaha, glad to be of some help.
SK1104,511,Get some rest while you can. I'll be going.
SK1104,512,...Thanks, Captain.
SK1104,513,Captain... I'm actually fine, right?
SK1104,514,I'm not sick or anything... right?
SK1104,515,Reni...
SK1104,516,OK, let me see your face, then.
SK1104,517,Ah...
SK1104,518,Yep, you're fine. Same as always.
SK1104,519,Captain...
SK1104,520,You don't have to worry, Reni. So long as you believe in me... in the Flower Division... you'll be all right.
SK1104,521,...Yeah.
SK1104,522,Though... It feels like my pulse has gotten even faster than before.
SK1104,523,All right, I'll be going now, Reni.
SK1104,524,OK.<br>Captain... Thanks.
SK1104,525,Reni said she'd be resting before we have to depart, right?
SK1104,526,I'll leave her alone till it's time for the mission.
SK1104,527,Wh-What is this place?!
SK1104,528,Ah, Mr. Ogami!
SK1104,529,Arf, arf! Woof!
SK1104,530,Ah! Tsubomi and
SK1104,531,<dog>!
SK1104,532,What the heck is this room?
SK1104,533,Heheh, the Grand Imperial Theater transformed to fit inside the Mikasa...
SK1104,534,So the seating area for the audience was flipped upside-down to fit too!
SK1104,535,I see, so that's what this is.
SK1104,536,By the way, I didn't know you two were aboard, too.
SK1104,537,Whoa, this room's upside-down, too.
SK1104,538,Looks like I'm in the audience seating area.
SK1104,539,Ah, Mr. Ogami!
SK1104,540,Arf, arf! Woof!
SK1104,541,Ah! Tsubomi and
SK1104,542,<dog>!
SK1104,543,You two came aboard, too?
SK1104,544,Heheh, yup! I can't work on the bridge just yet...
SK1104,545,But everyone's letting me help with making tea and meals.
SK1104,546,Now all my hard work as a waitress is starting to pay off!
SK1104,547,I see...
SK1104,548,We can't do much to support you...
SK1104,549,So we're going to make up for it by supporting everyone else!
SK1104,550,Arf, arf, arf!
SK1104,551,Haha, thanks Tsubomi,
SK1104,552,.
SK1104,553,
SK1104,554,and I are rooting for you, Ogami!
SK1104,555,Arf, arf!
SK1104,556,Hahaha, thanks.
SK1104,557,I'll do my best, on everyone's behalf.
SK1104,558,Wh-What is this place?!
SK1104,559,Ah, Ensign Ogami!
SK1104,560,Eep! Y-You're all here too?
SK1104,561,What even is this room, anyway?
SK1104,562,The entire Grand Imperial Theater transformed to fit inside the Mikasa.
SK1104,563,So now our room's upside down, too.
SK1104,564,I-I see. So that's what this is.
SK1104,565,Oh, this room's upside down as well. Looks like it's the Rose Division's room.
SK1104,566,But then... That means...
SK1104,567,EEEEEK! Ichirooo!
SK1104,568,Ensign Ogami! Good work out there!
SK1104,569,Ogami...
SK1104,570,So you're all aboard the Mikasa, too.
SK1104,571,But of course. We wouldn't dream of missing such a historic battle.
SK1104,572,When the time comes, Ensign Ogami, you must win with beauty...
SK1104,573,Fight with love in your heart...
SK1104,574,And come back safely, no matter what.
SK1104,575,Everyone... Thank you.
SK1104,576,Go give that dumb ol' Musashi a thrashing, Ichiro!
SK1104,577,I know... you can do it... Ogami.
SK1104,578,The Rose Division, the top-secret unit of love and beauty, will be supporting you from the Mikasa.
SK1104,579,OK. Thank you.
SK1104,580,Ah, Ogami. Nice fighting earlier.
SK1104,581,Seriously, for a second there, I thought the Mikasa was done for!
SK1104,582,But we were able to break though the Kouma's defensive line! Nice job as always, Ogami!
SK1104,583,Thanks, everyone.
SK1104,584,But it's thanks to all of you that the Mikasa's gotten this far.
SK1104,585,We'll be counting on you for the infiltration, too.
SK1104,586,Yes, sir. Just leave the Mikasa to the Wind Division!
SK1104,587,On that note, we're going to go on a short break ourselves.
SK1104,588,Let's make this mission a success!
SK1104,589,Oh, Ogami. Did you need something?
SK1104,590,Not really, I just sort of wandered into here.
SK1104,591,I see. If you're looking for Commander Yoneda, he's taking a rest in another room.
SK1104,592,...I see.
SK1104,593,It's finally time.
SK1104,594,I'm trying to cheer everyone up, just like you said, Kaede...
SK1104,595,But I think the one who's the most nervous about going into battle might be... me.
SK1104,596,Ogami, anxiety and fear aren't anything to be ashamed of.
SK1104,597,I'd be lying if I said I also wasn't feeling anxious right now.
SK1104,598,But yet... I'm not worried.
SK1104,599,I know you and the Flower Division can defeat any enemy!
SK1104,600,The commander and myself, we believe in all of you... So we're not worried.
SK1104,601,Kaede...
SK1104,602,You and the Flower Division are protecting the capital's future. Good luck, Ogami.
SK1104,603,...Yes, ma'am!
SK1104,604,Ogami, have you talked to everyone yet?
SK1104,605,No, not all of them.
SK1104,606,Your words and actions can help support everyone.
SK1104,607,It might be hard for you, but please, take care of the Flower Division.
SK1104,608,Right, understood.
SK1104,609,Sakura... She's not in her cabin.
SK1104,610,I'll go check elsewhere.
SK1104,611,Sakura seems to be resting in her quarters.
SK1104,612,I'll leave her alone until it's time for the mission to begin.
SK1104,613,Doesn't seem like Sumire's here.
SK1104,614,I wonder where she could've gone?
SK1104,615,Sumire seems to be resting inside.
SK1104,616,I should leave her alone until it's time to begin the mission.
SK1104,617,Maria? I wonder where she could be...
SK1104,618,Oh well, I'll go somewhere else.
SK1104,619,Maria seems to be resting inside.
SK1104,620,There's only so much time to rest before it's time for the mission to start, so I'll leave her be.
SK1104,621,Huh? Iris isn't in her cabin.
SK1104,622,Hmmm, where could she have gone?
SK1104,623,Iris should be resting inside right about now.
SK1104,624,I'll leave her alone for now, at least until it's time for the mission.
SK1104,625,Kohran's not in her quarters.
SK1104,626,It's possible she could be in the hangar right now.
SK1104,627,Looks like Kohran's still working on the Koubu in the hangar.
SK1104,628,With Kohran on the job, I have no doubt the Koubu will be in perfect shape in time for the mission.
SK1104,629,Orihime? Doesn't look like she's in.
SK1104,630,Oh well, guess I should go to another room.
SK1104,631,Orihime's taking her siesta until the mission starts.
SK1104,632,You don't have a lot of time, but get plenty of rest, OK?
SK1104,633,All hands reporting for duty, Commander Yoneda.
SK1104,634,Hm. Everyone's looking a lot better.
SK1104,635,Good. It's finally time to put our plan into motion, then.
SK1104,636,Commander.<br>I have just one question.
SK1104,637,The inside of Musashi is bound to be crawling with countless numbers of Kouma.
SK1104,638,How are we supposed to make it through a swarm of them like that?
SK1104,639,An astute observation, Maria.<br>Just as I'd expect from you.
SK1104,640,But not to worry.<br>I've come up with a plan.
SK1104,641,There's just one way left to seal away evil.
SK1104,642,It's called... "The Rite of Four Swords."
SK1104,643,The Rite of... Four Swords?
SK1104,644,A technique capable of sealing away evil, using four spirit swords passed down since antiquity.
SK1104,645,These four swords are made up of two swords and two blades.
SK1104,646,Commander Yoneda's Divine Blade Mekkyaku...
SK1104,647,Major Yamazaki's Luminous Blade Mukei...
SK1104,648,Colonel Shinguji's Spirit Sword Arataka...
SK1104,649,And finally, my older sister Ayame's Divine Sword Shirahatori.
SK1104,650,Wait, those are all...
SK1104,651,That's right. They're all members of the Anti-Kouma Corps, the precursor to the Imperial Assault Troupe.
SK1104,652,The Anti-Kouma Corps was made up of the inheritors of each of these swords.
SK1104,653,Eight years ago, during the Kouma War, when the Kouma appeared in the capital...
SK1104,654,The four of us attempted the Rite of Four Swords in an effort to seal them away.
SK1104,655,However...<br>We unfortunately lacked the power needed for the ritual.
SK1104,656,The Rite of Four Swords had failed, and we couldn't seal away the Kouma.
SK1104,657,In the end, Kazuma... He sacrificed his life and used the Power of Purification.
SK1104,658,...
SK1104,659,Ogami already has my Divine Blade Mekkyaku, and Sakura has the Spirit Sword Arataka.
SK1104,660,I'd like you two to perform the Rite of Four Swords.
SK1104,661,Huh?!<br>You want... US to do it?
SK1104,662,You two are the only ones who know how to wield a sword.
SK1104,663,Besides... With you two performing the rite, I know it'll succeed this time.
SK1104,664,Deep within Musashi must lie the source of the demonic energy powering it.
SK1104,665,If you can destroy that power source with the Rite of Four Swords, you can seal away the evil.
SK1104,666,...
SK1104,667,Understood.
SK1104,668,Understood. I'll give it a shot.
SK1104,669,And you, Sakura?
SK1104,670,Yes! Ogami and I will do it together!
SK1104,671,Thank you, both of you.
SK1104,672,We're entrusting all of our futures to you two.
SK1104,673,...
SK1104,674,Let's do this, Ogami.
SK1104,675,Let's seal away this evil, with our power, for our futures.
SK1104,676,Yeah. Let's give it a shot, Sakura.
SK1104,677,Thank you, both of you.
SK1104,678,We're entrusting all of our futures to you two.
SK1104,679,Commander Yoneda. We've finished our inspection of our six main engines.
SK1104,680,Preparations are complete, ready to begin the mission!
SK1104,681,It's finally time. Right, to the bridge!
SK1104,682,Awaiting your orders, Commander.
SK1104,683,This ship is about to engage in a full-scale assault against Musashi!
SK1104,684,After we hit Musashi with the main cannon, we'll ram directly into it!
SK1104,685,Following that, we'll launch the Thunderstrike, loaded with all your Koubu.
SK1104,686,The Mikasa will then withdraw immediately thereafter.
SK1104,687,Finally, the Flower Division will infiltrate the core of Musashi and destroy it from the inside!
SK1104,688,I'm counting on you, Ogami!
SK1104,689,Yes, sir!
SK1104,690,Main engines, accelerate to full power!
SK1104,691,Main engines, outputting at full power!
SK1104,692,Mikasa, full speed ahead.<br>Destination: Musashi!!
SK1104,693,Destination: Musashi!
SK1104,694,Commander! The main cannon is ready to fire!
SK1104,695,It's finally time, Commander.
SK1104,696,Yeah...<br>Time to give 'em one hell of a show!
SK1104,697,Whoooooa!
SK1104,698,S-Status report, now!
SK1104,699,Main engines...<br>All operational! No anomalies detected!
SK1104,700,No anomalies detected in the spirit energy systems, either!
SK1104,701,The Mikasa has successfully penetrated Musashi!
SK1104,702,Good, so we did it, huh?
SK1104,703,Heheh, looks like we're finally up.
SK1104,704,We're counting on you, everyone.<br>Once you get back, we're gonna have ourselves a party!
SK1104,705,We'll be supporting you from the bridge, everyone!
SK1104,706,To all of you in the Flower Division: even in the midst of battle, never forget about beauty.
SK1104,707,Ichirooo! I'm gonna give you so many smooches when you get back!
SK1104,708,I'll be praying... for your safety.
SK1104,709,I know you can do it, everyone.
SK1104,710,You'll have to tell me aaaall about what the inside of Musashi was like once we get back home!
SK1104,711,Please... Make sure to come back home!
SK1104,712,Thanks, everyone!
SK1104,713,The time has finally come.
SK1104,714,Kaede...
SK1104,715,Before you go off to fight... There's something I want to ask you.
SK1104,716,What's your attitude going into this battle?
SK1104,717,We're coming back alive!
SK1104,718,We must defeat Kyogoku at any cost!
SK1104,719,We're going to defeat Kyogoku... And we're coming back alive!
SK1104,720,Very good...<br>You pass, Ogami.
SK1104,721,We must defeat Kyogoku, no matter the cost!
SK1104,722,In that case, if you're serious... Then I can't let you go.
SK1104,723,Huh?!
SK1104,724,What's your answer, Ogami?
SK1104,725,R-Right, it's kind of a hard question, so I was just thinking hard about it...
SK1104,726,...Keep it together. You're going to make me worried if you go out like that.
SK1104,727,That battle two years ago... My older sister, Ayame, was the troupe's deputy commander at the time.
SK1104,728,Ayame gave her life to put an end to that battle.
SK1104,729,But we can't keep protecting the peace at the cost of people sacrificing their lives.
SK1104,730,I think you know how that feels for the ones left behind.
SK1104,731,...
SK1104,732,Promise me, Ogami.
SK1104,733,Promise me that you and the others will come back home alive.
SK1104,734,Kaede...
SK1104,735,You must not die.<br>You mustn't even think it's OK to die.
SK1104,736,Ogami... You'll promise me that, won't you?
SK1104,737,I promise.
SK1104,738,I promise.<br>We're all coming back from this together!
SK1104,739,...Thank you, Ogami.
SK1104,740,Ogami... Answer me.
SK1104,741,Ogami, this is one of the four swords: the Divine Sword Shirahatori.
SK1104,742,The Demon King...<br>No, Colonel Kazuma Shinguji holds the Luminous Blade Mukei.
SK1104,743,With it, you should be able to perform the Rite of Four Swords.
SK1104,744,Yes, ma'am.
SK1104,745,Now, you'd better get going. We're all waiting for your safe return.
SK1104,746,OK, we'll be right back!
SK1104,747,Captain, the Flower Division is ready to deploy.
SK1104,748,The Thunderstrike has finished undergoing maintenance as well.
SK1104,749,I see...<br>So it's finally time.
SK1104,750,Time for the final battle.
SK1104,751,Everything's gone according to plan so far.
SK1104,752,It's our turn from here on out!
SK1104,753,The Koubu are in tip-top shape!
SK1104,754,I'm gonna do my very best!
SK1104,755,The climax starts here.
SK1104,756,Everybody, don't let your guard down.
SK1104,757,Yeah. Time to get fired up!
SK1104,758,Awaiting your orders, Ogami!
SK1104,759,Awaiting your orders, Ensign!

SK1104,767,We're coming back... alive!
SK1104,768,Imperial Assault Troupe, move out! It's time for our final battle!
SK1104,769,Sir, yes, sir!
SK1104,770,All pilots aboard the Thunderstrike! Time to infiltrate Musashi!
SK1104,771,We're coming back from this... alive! Only when every one of us comes back will it be a true victory!
SK1104,772,Yes, sir!
SK1104,773,All pilots aboard the Thunderstrike! Time to infiltrate Musashi!
SK1104,774,Everyone... I don't have anything special to say.
SK1104,775,We're all coming back from this together, just like we always do!
SK1104,776,Yes, sir!

SK1202,13,Father... What happened to you?
SK1202,14,Eight years ago, I lost my life in the Kouma War.
SK1202,15,I was brought back... by Kyogoku's necromancy...
SK1202,16,As a soldier... to fight for him.
SK1202,17,No...
SK1202,18,His spell was... powerful... But... you broke it...
SK1202,19,You truly are... my daughter...<br>You did well, Sakura...<br>You've grown... so strong...
SK1202,20,Father...
SK1202,21,Demon King...<br>It seems your usefulness has reached its end.
SK1202,22,...!<br>That voice!
SK1202,23,We meet again,<br>Imperial Assault Troupe.
SK1202,24,Kyogoku!
SK1202,25,I granted both Shinguji and Yamazaki temporary life. They were my... puppets, so to speak.
SK1202,26,Now that Musashi has returned, I no longer have any need for such pawns.
SK1202,27,Kyogoku!
SK1202,28,You won't get away with this!
SK1202,29,Justice will prevail!
SK1202,30,How dare you toy with people's lives! You won't get away with this!
SK1202,31,Know your place, Ogami!
SK1202,32,Lofty ideals require sacrifice!
SK1202,33,Justice... will always prevail!
SK1202,34,Fool! Justice is nothing more than a fleeting convenience!
SK1202,35,Hmph! Have you no words, Ogami?!
SK1202,36,Maggots! You who would govern this city with your fraudulent justice!
SK1202,37,This is the end for you!
SK1202,38,DIE!!
SK1202,39,EEEEEK!!
SK1202,40,DAMN IIIIIT!!
SK1202,41,GWAAAAAGH!
SK1202,42,Wh... What?!
SK1202,43,F-Father?!
SK1202,44,K-Kyogoku... I won't let you... have your way!
SK1202,45,I won't let you... kill my Sakura!
SK1202,46,Father!!
SK1202,47,Sakura... Listen to me...
SK1202,48,The giant crystal in this room... is the power source... controlling the Kouma weapons.
SK1202,49,Perform the Rite of Four Swords... Destroy the crystal to seal away the evil.
SK1202,50,Then... strike down all the pillars... in the hall just beyond here!
SK1202,51,Shatter Kyogoku's ambitions!
SK1202,52,Urgh... Damn you!
SK1202,53,Sakura...<br>Show me your face...<br>One last time...
SK1202,54,Father!
SK1202,55,Sakura...<br>Stay strong and live!
SK1202,56,No!
SK1202,57,Sakura...<br>You've developed a strong, unwavering sword arm.
SK1202,58,Father...<br>No, don't go!!
SK1202,59,If only for a brief moment... I'm so glad... I could speak with you... as your father.
SK1202,60,Sakura... Tell your mother... I... love her...
SK1202,61,FATHERRRR!!
SK1202,62,Damn you, Shinguji... To think he could take the full brunt of my power...
SK1202,63,Kyogoku, you bastard!
SK1202,64,I've used up all my strength, so I must retreat for now. Consider yourselves lucky.
SK1202,65,However...<br>When next we meet...<br>It will be your doom.
SK1202,66,Damn you, Kyogoku...
SK1202,67,...
SK1202,68,Sakura...
SK1202,69,Fa... ther...
SK1202,70,I... will live on.
SK1202,71,I'll keep on living, on your behalf as well!
SK1202,72,Sakura...
SK1202,73,I'll treasure the life you and Mother gave me.
SK1202,74,I'll stay strong and live on... Father.
SK1202,75,All we can do to stop Kyogoku is perform the Rite of Four Swords.
SK1202,76,Ogami... Let's do this.
SK1202,77,OK, got it!
SK1202,78,Will you be all right, Sakura?
SK1202,79,OK, got it!
SK1202,80,Let's perform the Rite of Four Swords and seal away this evil!
SK1202,81,Roger!
SK1202,82,Sakura... Will you be all right?
SK1202,83,You don't have to worry. My feelings are under total control.

SK1202,96,It's gonna be OK, Sakura! It's totally gonna work!
SK1202,97,Mon Frère's with you! It's definitely gonna work!
SK1202,98,You got nothing to worry about, Sakura. You got the Chief with ya!
SK1202,99,With the Ensign with you, this'll totally work, Sakura!
SK1202,100,The odds of your success are approximately 100%.
SK1202,101,With the Captain at your side... This is sure to work.

SK1202,136,EEEEK!<br>They did iiiit!
SK1202,137,It's too early to celebrate. Musashi's not sunk just yet.
SK1202,138,Ogami... Take Musashi down...
SK1202,139,Everyone in the Flower Division... Please... Bring Musashi down.
SK1202,140,Kazuma...

SK1203,1,Huh?!<br>Musashi... It suddenly started moving!
SK1203,2,It's leaving the capital's airspace. It's headed towards the Pacific Ocean!
SK1203,3,What on earth is going on?
SK1203,4,Musashi needs to absorb city energy", so for it to leave the capital's airspace is... strange.
SK1203,5,Could it be? Did Ichiro and the others pull it off?
SK1203,6,In that case... Musashi's...
SK1203,7,Yes...<br>If that is indeed the case.
SK1203,8,Yes. There's the possibility that it's lost control.
SK1203,9,It appears that Ogami and the others have finally reached Musashi's core.
SK1203,10,We're finally at the end of the end, eh?
SK1203,11,OK! Mikasa, after Musashi!
SK1203,12,We need to be ready to rescue them whenever!

SK1203,18,Roger!
SK1203,19,...?!<br>What the hell is this place?
SK1203,20,Heheheh...<br>You've come at last, Assault Troupe.
SK1203,21,Kyogoku!
SK1203,22,Kyogoku?!<br>Show yourself!!
SK1203,23,I'm right here, maggots!
SK1203,24,Whoa!
SK1203,25,Wh-What a huge Hex Mech!
SK1203,26,Witness the guardian of Musashi, the throne of the Imperial Gods: Shinnou! Ahahahahaha!
SK1203,27,Shinnou...
SK1203,28,With Shinnou under my control, I'll kill every last one of you! You'll die for my ideals!
SK1203,29,You could never hope to understand... MY IDEALS!
SK1203,30,I don't want to hear it!
SK1203,31,Your... ideals?
SK1203,32,I don't want to hear it! I don't give a damn about your ideals!
SK1203,33,You've lost control over Musashi!<br>Prepare yourself, Kyogoku!
SK1203,34,I'll admit, I underestimated you worms.
SK1203,35,But I won't simply die here!<br>I'll drag you all to hell with me!
SK1203,36,I'll admit, I underestimated you worms.
SK1203,37,But I won't simply die here!<br>I'll drag you all to hell with me!
SK1203,38,Your... ideals?!
SK1203,39,You wish to know?<br>Very well, then. I'll tell you.
SK1203,40,My dream... is to build a true capital on this land!
SK1203,41,A... TRUE capital?
SK1203,42,How are you going to do that?
SK1203,43,A... TRUE capital? What are you talking about?!
SK1203,44,The true capital... A world where man and demon can coexist...
SK1203,45,Wh... What?!
SK1203,46,A true capital? How do you plan to build such a thing?
SK1203,47,Not building; purifying!
SK1203,48,Everything can only begin once I've purified the capital... By destroying it!
SK1203,49,Wh... What?!
SK1203,50,Hahaha! I don't expect a lowly worm like you to understand!
SK1203,51,Deep below the capital...<br>There rest the vengeful spirits we call "Kouma."
SK1203,52,Humans took the power of these spirits, calling it "city energy, and used it to establish their capital!
SK1203,53,Nobody can claim such a place isn't inherently tainted!
SK1203,54,I have no need for this tainted city! The capital must be cleansed, destroyed by my hand!
SK1203,55,Destroyed by my hand,<br>reborn by my hand,<br>and ruled by my hand!
SK1203,56,THAT is my true capital!
SK1203,57,Open your eyes to the truth, Ichiro Ogami! This city must be purged!
SK1203,58,You're wrong!
SK1203,59,A true... capital...
SK1203,60,You're wrong!
SK1203,61,I won't let anyone rob the futures of the people!
SK1203,62,Ogami's right!
SK1203,63,A true... capital...
SK1203,64,Don't let him fool you, Ogami!
SK1203,65,We can't let anyone rob everybody's future!
SK1203,66,...
SK1203,67,Don't let him fool you, Ogami!
SK1203,68,We can't let anyone rob everybody's future!
SK1203,69,But doesn't Musashi also require city energy to function?
SK1203,70,You just came up with whatever excuse was the most convenient for you!
SK1203,71,Heh...<br>I don't expect the likes of you to understand the truth.
SK1203,72,It was a mistake to allow you maggots to get this far.
SK1203,73,But I won't simply die here!<br>I'll drag you all to hell with me!

SK1204,10,The battle was over.
SK1204,11,The threat of evil had passed, and spring once again came to the capital.
SK1204,12,The people fully regained their smiles...
SK1204,13,And little by little, the ruined city was restored to its former glory.
SK1204,14,Life in the Imperial Theater returned to normal...
SK1204,15,Everyone was busy getting ready for the spring production, "Continuation of the Dream."

SK1204,23,Their smiles from atop that stage were the most radiant I've ever seen.

SK1205,1,What great weather today, a nice and sunny spring day.
SK1205,2,Our spring production is over, and the Imperial Theater's on break. Now, what should I do today...?
SK1205,3,(Hm? Who could that be?)
SK1205,4,Yes, coming!
SK1205,5,Well if it isn't Sakura. Did you need something?
SK1205,6,Yes. I have a favor to ask you, Ogami.
SK1205,7,If it's all right with you, could you meet me by the entrance later?
SK1205,8,A favor? What could that possibly be?
SK1205,9,Heehee, it's a secret. All right, I'll be waiting!
SK1205,10,Meet her by the entrance, huh? Could she be asking me out on a date?
SK1205,11,I guess I ought to head down to the entrance.
SK1205,12,Well if it isn't Sumire. Did you need something?
SK1205,13,Ensign, are you available right now?
SK1205,14,Yeah, I'm open.
SK1205,15,There's something I'd like your help with.
SK1205,16,Would you mind coming to the salon later?
SK1205,17,All right, sure. What is it you need help with?
SK1205,18,You can look forward to learning that once you come to the salon. Until then, good day.
SK1205,19,What could it be?<br>Hmm, now I'm curious.
SK1205,20,OK, guess I'll head over to the salon.
SK1205,21,Hey, Maria. What's up?
SK1205,22,Captain, um... Are you free right now?
SK1205,23,Yeah, sure, but... What's up?
SK1205,24,You remember how we went to Yokohama, right?
SK1205,25,Yeah, I remember.<br>We went together for New Year's.
SK1205,26,Back then our trip was interrupted by the Black Demons and we were forced to come back early.
SK1205,27,So, um... This wouldn't exactly be a do-over, but...
SK1205,28,If it's all right with you... Would you like to go to Yokohama with me again?
SK1205,29,Yeah, sure.<br>I'd be glad to.
SK1205,30,Really? Thank you.
SK1205,31,I'll wait for you over by the entrance. Until then.
SK1205,32,A date with Maria in Yokohama, huh? Can't wait.
SK1205,33,Right, guess I should head over to the entrance.
SK1205,34,Yo, Boss.
SK1205,35,Hey, Kanna. Need something?
SK1205,36,Well... You got a minute?
SK1205,37,If you're free, you wanna come with me to the beach?
SK1205,38,The beach? It's a little early in the year to go swimming, isn't it?
SK1205,39,We wouldn't be swimming, but... Well... I just wanna go look at the ocean with you.
SK1205,40,Heheh, I know this ain't really like me.
SK1205,41,So, Boss... Wanna go?
SK1205,42,Yeah, sure.<br>I'd be glad to.
SK1205,43,Really?<br>Thanks, Boss!
SK1205,44,All right, I'll be waiting over by the entrance. See ya later!
SK1205,45,A beach trip with Kanna, huh? Can't wait.
SK1205,46,OK, guess I'll head over to the entrance, then.
SK1205,47,Heheheh, hey Mon Frère!
SK1205,48,Hey, Iris. Did you need something?
SK1205,49,Uh-huh! Let's go on a date, Mon Frère, right now!
SK1205,50,You promised we'd go on a date after we got back, remember?
SK1205,51,Hahaha, now that you mention it, I guess I did.
SK1205,52,Sure, let's go. I'd be more than happy to.
SK1205,53,Yaaaaaay! Thanks, Mon Frère!
SK1205,54,Leave the itinerary to me!
SK1205,55,Really? All right then, go ahead.
SK1205,56,Come to my room once you're ready, OK?
SK1205,57,All right, see you later! Bye-byyye!
SK1205,58,A date with Iris, huh? Hmmm, where does she plan on taking me?
SK1205,59,OK, guess I'll head over to her room.
SK1205,60,Hey Chief, ya free right now?
SK1205,61,Hey Kohran. Did you need something?
SK1205,62,Well, you know how I used to work at the Hanayashiki Branch, right?
SK1205,63,Yeah, I know.
SK1205,64,There's a munitions factory underground below the Hanayashiki Branch...
SK1205,65,But on the surface, it's a theme park that the general public can come and visit.
SK1205,66,Chief... Would you wanna go there with me?
SK1205,67,Kohran...
SK1205,68,Sure, I'd be more than happy to.
SK1205,69,For real?!<br>Thanks a bunch, Chief!
SK1205,70,All right, just swing by my room when you're ready to go! I'll be waiting!
SK1205,71,An amusement park date with Kohran, huh? Can't wait.
SK1205,72,OK, guess I'll head over to Kohran's room, then.
SK1205,73,Ciao, Ensign.
SK1205,74,Hey, Orihime. Did you need something?
SK1205,75,Actually, Ensign, there's something I wanted to show you.
SK1205,76,Come by my room later, please!
SK1205,77,Something to show me?
SK1205,78,Heehee, whatever could it be?
SK1205,79,OK then, I'll be waiting!
SK1205,80,Something to show me, huh? I wonder what it is.
SK1205,81,All right, guess I'll head over to Orihime's room, then.
SK1205,82,Hey, Reni. Did you need something?
SK1205,83,Captain... Are you free right now?
SK1205,84,Yeah, I'm open.
SK1205,85,There's... a festival nearby today.
SK1205,86,So...
SK1205,87,...
SK1205,88,Reni...
SK1205,89,We could go together, if you want.
SK1205,90,Yeah... Thanks, Captain.
SK1205,91,OK then, come to my room later. I'll be on standby.
SK1205,92,On standby, huh? Hahaha, some things never change with her.
SK1205,93,OK, guess I ought to head over to Reni's room.
SK1205,94,Ahh... What nice weather.
SK1205,95,The spring breeze is so refreshing.
SK1205,96,Ogamiiii!
SK1205,97,Hey, Sakura. Is that...?
SK1205,98,Yes, it's a bicycle. I was hoping we could ride it together.
SK1205,99,I see... So that's what this was all about.
SK1205,100,I figured we might be going somewhere, since you wanted to meet by the entrance.
SK1205,101,Ever since that battle, I've been thinking about how much I wanted to go out on a date.
SK1205,102,I thought we could go to a fancy restaurant or shop at a high-end boutique or something...
SK1205,103,But during that battle... We were together the whole time... And it made me realize something.
SK1205,104,I'm happy just being with you, Ogami.
SK1205,105,...
SK1205,106,I want to be with you just the way I always am, without trying to impress you.
SK1205,107,I want to treasure every moment I get to spend with you.
SK1205,108,Sakura...
SK1205,109,OK, Ogami, let's get going.
SK1205,110,Now, could you please hold the back of the bike up for me?
SK1205,111,Huh?! W-Wait, then... That favor of yours...
SK1205,112,That's right! I want you to help me practice.
SK1205,113,Heh, I only just bought this bike, I don't actually know how to ride it yet.
SK1205,114,S-Say what?!
SK1205,115,Thanks for offering to teach me! Now, full steam aheeead!
SK1205,116,Whoa! S-Sakura, waaaaait!
SK1205,117,Oops, I don't think this outfit's gonna cut it for a date.
SK1205,118,Better get changed while I'm at it.
SK1205,119,There, that should do it. Let's go.
SK1205,120,Hey, Maria. Did I keep you waiting?
SK1205,121,No, you're all right. We have plenty of time.
SK1205,122,Now, how about we take a steam taxi over to Yokohama?
SK1205,123,Sure, let's do that.
SK1205,124,Here you go, Maria.
SK1205,125,Thank you.
SK1205,126,Why don't we go see the ocean at night?
SK1205,127,The view is bound to be lovely.
SK1205,128,I see. Can't wait.
SK1205,129,This marks the second time we'll have visited the ocean in Yokohama.
SK1205,130,I feel like we'll be able to make some new memories today.
SK1205,131,Memories by the ocean, huh?
SK1205,132,That reminds me of how we were stuck in that cave in Atami during our summer vacation.
SK1205,133,Yes... That's another memory I'll never be able to forget.
SK1205,134,Well, I don't think you'll have to worry about swimming this time around.
SK1205,135,Captain, please, don't tease me like that!
SK1205,136,Hahaha. Sorry, sorry.
SK1205,137,Driver, I'm ready to go now.
SK1205,138,W-Wait a second, Maria, don't leave me here!
SK1205,139,Hm hm hm, I'm just kidding, Captain.
SK1205,140,After all, nothing makes me happier than being with you.
SK1205,141,Yo, Boss! You came!
SK1205,142,Of course I did. Right, so which beach are we going to?
SK1205,143,I was thinking 'bout going to the beach over in Shonan.
SK1205,144,Shonan? Sounds good.
SK1205,145,Heheh, so, uh... Does this count as a date?
SK1205,146,I'm getting a little embarrassed...
SK1205,147,Kanna...
SK1205,148,R-Right, let's get goin'! Race you to Shonan!
SK1205,149,Whoa, wait, Kanna!<br>Are we running all the way to Shonan?!
SK1205,150,Wh-Whoops.<br>Force of habit.<br>Guess I'm a little nervous... 
SK1205,151,Hahaha, the train's just arrived, so how about we ride it there instead.
SK1205,152,Woohoo!<br>Look, Boss, the ocean!<br>I can see the ocean!
SK1205,153,You're right. Ah, the smell of the ocean sure brings me back...
SK1205,154,I've always loved looking at the ocean, ever since I was a kid.
SK1205,155,I always thought about going to the beach with you once the fighting was all over.
SK1205,156,Kanna...
SK1205,157,Whenever I look at the ocean... It makes me feel brave.
SK1205,158,It gives me the courage to take on anything, with everything I've got.
SK1205,159,...
SK1205,160,I wanted to see the ocean so I could feel brave enough to... Um... Tell you how I, uh...
SK1205,161,What is it, Kanna?
SK1205,162,Heheh, nope, still can't do it! Too embarrassed to say it!
SK1205,163,All right, Boss, race you to the water!
SK1205,164,C'mon, Kanna, tell me, I wanna know now!
SK1205,165,C'mon, better start running or you're gonna get left behind! Hahahaha!
SK1205,166,The spring sunlight's pouring into the theater.
SK1205,167,Looks we're gonna have great weather all day today.
SK1205,168,Orihime often plays piano here.
SK1205,169,What is it that she wants to show me, anyway?
SK1205,170,Hey, is that you, Orihime?
SK1205,171,Ciao, Ensign.<br>Did you come to listen to me play piano?
SK1205,172,No, that's not why I'm here.
SK1205,173,Aww, that's a little disappointing.
SK1205,174,I've come up with all sorts of music ideas ever since we got back from our last battle.
SK1205,175,I have to work my hardest so I don't lose out to Papa!
SK1205,176,Hahaha, I see.
SK1205,177,All right, Orihime, I'm gonna go now.
SK1205,178,Stay a while and listen to me play next time, OK?
SK1205,179,(Orihime's playing piano.)
SK1205,180,(I'll leave her be. Wouldn't want to disturb her.)
SK1205,181,Mr. Yoneda. Drinking as usual, eh?
SK1205,182,That you, Ogami? Wanna drink?
SK1205,183,N-No, I'm good.
SK1205,184,Aw, you're no fun.
SK1205,185,Still, you did great in that last battle.
SK1205,186,And now... Kazuma can truly rest in peace.
SK1205,187,...Yes, sir.
SK1205,188,Everyone put their lives on the line to defend this city...
SK1205,189,So you better keep defendin' it, no slackin' off! Hahahaha!
SK1205,190,...Yes, sir.
SK1205,191,Mr. Yoneda.<br>It's Ogami...
SK1205,192,Zzzzzzzz... Zzzzzzzz...
SK1205,193,Sounds like the manager's fallen asleep.
SK1205,194,That makes sense, what with all his drinking and this warm weather.
SK1205,195,Ah, hello, Ogami!
SK1205,196,Hello, you two. Hard at work, I see.
SK1205,197,Yes, our clerical work's really piled up, thanks to that battle...
SK1205,198,We've been working overtime constantly since then, it's been tough!
SK1205,199,I see. Keep up the good work, you two.
SK1205,200,Roger! Yuri Sakakibara, ready to get back to work!
SK1205,201,Oops, slipped into Mikasa mode for a second, there.
SK1205,202,Hahaha...
SK1205,203,Hm hm hm, oh, Yuri.
SK1205,204,OK, I'm gonna get going now. Good luck, you two.
SK1205,205,OK. Thanks for everything, Ogami.
SK1205,206,Come back to help us out sometime!
SK1205,207,Oh, Ogami. Back so soon?
SK1205,208,Looks like you've got lots of free time.
SK1205,209,I know! Maybe you could help us sort the receipts?
SK1205,210,N-No, I've got plans, I don't have the time.
SK1205,211,What sort of plans?
SK1205,212,W-Well, that's, uh...
SK1205,213,I smell a scoop! You'll have to tell me all about it, Ogami!
SK1205,214,N-No can do! I have to go.
SK1205,215,Ah! Ogami, waaaait!
SK1205,216,Ah, Ogami! So, what were those plans of yours?
SK1205,217,N-Nothing in particular...
SK1205,218,Sheesh... Now I have to know.
SK1205,219,N-Now, now, you don't have to worry about me.
SK1205,220,Anyway, looks like you two have a lot of work to do, but good luck!
SK1205,221,OK. Thanks you.
SK1205,222,Come back and tell me if you change your mind, OK, Ogami?
SK1205,223,Spring has come, and the trees in the courtyard are full and green again.
SK1205,224,My second spring since coming back to the Imperial Theater... How time flies.
SK1205,225,...
SK1205,226,Oh, is that you, Reni?
SK1205,227,...Captain.
SK1205,228,What are you doing out here?
SK1205,229,I was just... looking at the theater.
SK1205,230,Standing here, looking at it... It makes me feel calm.
SK1205,231,This... is where I belong.
SK1205,232,Reni...
SK1205,233,I'm going to stay here a little longer.
SK1205,234,OK, I'll be going, then. See you later, Reni.
SK1205,235,(Reni's still in the courtyard.)
SK1205,236,(She must be savoring the joy she feels from being back at the theater.)
SK1205,237,I guess not even Kanna would eat before going out.
SK1205,238,A beach trip with Kanna, huh? Can't wait.
SK1205,239,Yo, Boss. Here to eat?
SK1205,240,Hahaha, nope. I see you're eating like you always do, though.
SK1205,241,Yeah, the food here really is great!
SK1205,242,OK, onto bowl number eleven!
SK1205,243,N-Number eleven?!
SK1205,244,You want some, Boss?
SK1205,245,N-No thanks, I'm good.<br>Enjoy your food.
SK1205,246,Gotcha.<br>Later, boss!
SK1205,247,Oh, Boss. You're back.
SK1205,248,Let me know whenever you get hungry.
SK1205,249,I'm always ready to whip up some good food for ya.
SK1205,250,Thanks, Kanna.
SK1205,251,See you later. I'll be counting on you once I feel hungry.
SK1205,252,Yeah, I gotcha covered!<br>Later, Boss!
SK1205,253,Ah, Ogami! Good afternoon!
SK1205,254,Tsubomi? What are you doing by the stage?
SK1205,255,Ah, right. I just wanted to take one last look at the Imperial Theater's stage before I go.
SK1205,256,I'll be going back to the Maidens' Academy.
SK1205,257,Everyone there wants me to tell them about that last battle!
SK1205,258,I see... So I guess this means goodbye.
SK1205,259,Good luck with everything.
SK1205,260,Yes, sir! Thank you so much for taking care of me this whole time, Ogami.
SK1205,261,I'll work hard and smile-smile until I can stand on top of this stage one day!
SK1205,262,Oh, I almost forgot! Could I please get a handshake, Ogami?
SK1205,263,Yeah, sure...
SK1205,264,EEEEK! I got to shake hands with the Captain Ogami of the Flower Division! Everyone's gonna be so jealous!
SK1205,265,Thank you so much! And... goodbye!
SK1205,266,Good luck out there, Tsubomi.
SK1205,267,Did Tsubomi already leave for the Maidens' Academy?
SK1205,268,Tsubomi may fail at a lot of things, but if I know her like I think I do...
SK1205,269,Then I know the day will come when she'll be able to stand on this stage.
SK1205,270,Ah, Ogami! Welcome!
SK1205,271,Working hard, Tsubaki?
SK1205,272,Yes! I do work here, after all.
SK1205,273,Aren't you tired from working during the spring production right after that battle?
SK1205,274,Whatever exhaustion I feel gets blown away when I see my customers' smiling faces!
SK1205,275,You did a good job, too, Ogami!
SK1205,276,Hahaha, thanks.
SK1205,277,All right, keep up the good work. See you later, Tsubaki.
SK1205,278,Thank you, come again!
SK1205,279,Ah, welcome, Ogami!
SK1205,280,Could I get a photo, Tsubaki?
SK1205,281,Sorry, Ogami. We're replacing all the photos for new ones right now.
SK1205,282,You'll have to wait until the new ones come in.
SK1205,283,I see... Oh well, then.
SK1205,284,All right, I'll stop by some other time. Keep up the good work, Tsubaki.
SK1205,285,OK, thank you! Come again!
SK1205,286,Even the VIP entrance was buzzing with guests during our spring production.
SK1205,287,I'm glad Minister Yamaguchi and Count Hanakoji were able to come see it.
SK1205,288,We made so many onigiri to hand out during the play.
SK1205,289,Iris caused quite the scene with her chocolate onigiri.
SK1205,290,The costumes for our spring production were a big hit with the crowds.
SK1205,291,The stage here will be livened up with all kinds of costumes for years to come, I'm sure.
SK1205,292,Once we finally wrapped the spring production, we partied in this room straight until dawn.
SK1205,293,Everyone was pumped up from having worked so hard to make this production a success.
SK1205,294,It's so quiet now that the play's over, feels like all that hustle and bustle was just a dream.
SK1205,295,Now that it's over, I almost feel a little nostalgic for how nervous I felt.
SK1205,296,The Flower Division may be on break for now...
SK1205,297,But soon they'll be turning that stage into a wonderful dreamland once again.
SK1205,298,That reminds me, it was here that I first ran into Kayama at the theater, huh?
SK1205,299,I had no idea he was the captain of the Moon Division back then, though.
SK1205,300,After having sold so many tickets for the spring production...
SK1205,301,I feel like this past year's made me better at ticket punching.
SK1205,302,Hey, Sakura.
SK1205,303,Oh, Ogami.
SK1205,304,I just got back from my sword training.
SK1205,305,I see. You sure work hard, Sakura.
SK1205,306,Well, I do need to train a lot more if I ever hope to catch up to my father.
SK1205,307,All right, Ogami, I'll be going now. See you later.
SK1205,308,Sakura's really trying her best.
SK1205,309,I know she'll be able to surpass her father someday.
SK1205,310,Oh, Ogami. Did you need something?
SK1205,311,No, nothing in particular.
SK1205,312,Oh, I see. I was writing my reports just now.
SK1205,313,You did a fantastic job, Ogami. What's more...
SK1205,314,You kept your promise to me. You came back, alive.
SK1205,315,Yes, ma'am.
SK1205,316,Every single member of the Flower Division made it back, together...
SK1205,317,And it's all because of you, Ogami. Thank you so much.
SK1205,318,Kaede...
SK1205,319,Now then, you'd better get going. After all, you've got someone waiting for you, don't you?
SK1205,320,Huh?!<br>But... How did you know?
SK1205,321,Hm hm hm, I'm the deputy commander, remember? All right, run along now.
SK1205,322,Um... It's Ogami.
SK1205,323,Oh, Ogami? Did you still need something?
SK1205,324,Don't waste too much time, or else a certain someone'll get fed up waiting for you.
SK1205,325,R-Right...
SK1205,326,Hm hm hm... Now, hurry up and get going.
SK1205,327,Yes, ma'am. Understood.
SK1205,328,This room fills me with so many memories...
SK1205,329,Like how whenever I was alone, I'd often get visited by--
SK1205,330,Yo, Ogami!
SK1205,331,That voice... Kayama?!
SK1205,332,Haha, indeed! Alley OOP!
SK1205,333,Anyway, Ogami, this peace sure is lovely, isn't it?
SK1205,334,This peace we fight so hard to protect is truly, truly wonderful!
SK1205,335,Kayama... You didn't get hurt fighting the Kouma, did you?
SK1205,336,I told you I'd be fine. Don't underestimate the Moon Division!
SK1205,337,But hold on, Ogami... Does that mean you were worried about me?
SK1205,338,Well of course I was. We're both part of the Imperial Assault Troupe. We're partners, aren't we?
SK1205,339,Ogami... Thank you. What a joy it is to be able to fight at your side!
SK1205,340,However, there is an old saying: "Tighten your helmet strings in the hour of victory."
SK1205,341,As captains of the Flower and Moon Divisions, let's both strive to do our best!
SK1205,342,Yeah!
SK1205,343,Well then, farewell, Ogami! Alley OOP!
SK1205,344,Adiòs!<br>Till we meet again!
SK1205,345,Kayama's not here anymore.
SK1205,346,Eh, knowing him, I'm sure he'll pop up out of nowhere again at some point.
SK1205,347,Reni? It's Ogami.
SK1205,348,Captain? Can you wait a second?
SK1205,349,Yeah, sure.
SK1205,350,...
SK1205,351,...Reni? What's wrong?
SK1205,352,Sorry. I'm coming out now.
SK1205,353,Wow! That's a yukata, isn't it?
SK1205,354,Kaede picked this out for me when I told her about the festival.
SK1205,355,She told me I should wear this if I was going to go.
SK1205,356,I see. It looks great on you, Reni.
SK1205,357,Thank you. I've been eager to try it on.
SK1205,358,I used to think all clothes were the same to me.
SK1205,359,...
SK1205,360,But I realized that that's not true.
SK1205,361,When I put on the same Flower Division uniform as the others, I felt a strong sense of courage.
SK1205,362,And when I came home from the battle and put on my regular clothes...
SK1205,363,I felt so happy I could live together with everyone again.
SK1205,364,Reni...
SK1205,365,I wonder how wearing this yukata will make me feel...
SK1205,366,Reni? It's Ogami.
SK1205,367,...
SK1205,368,Hmm, doesn't seem like she's in.
SK1205,369,I wonder if Iris plans on going to a fancy restaurant or something...
SK1205,370,I should dress nicely, just in case.
SK1205,371,There, that should do it.
SK1205,372,Iris? It's Ogami.
SK1205,373,Ah, Mon Frère? Come in!
SK1205,374,OK, then. Excuse me...
SK1205,375,Wow, Mon Frère, you look so cool!
SK1205,376,I didn't know where we were going for our date, so I thought I'd play it safe.
SK1205,377,Heheh, I've also been thinking about what to wear this whole time!
SK1205,378,Hahaha, this whole time, huh? Sounds like you had your hands full.
SK1205,379,Well yeah, I've been looking forward to this date since forever!
SK1205,380,I've been looking forward to going on a date once the fighting was over for a long time!
SK1205,381,Mon Frère... I'm so happy the fighting's over.
SK1205,382,Iris...
SK1205,383,Heheh! OK, I'm gonna put this on and then we can go!
SK1205,384,This date's gonna go great, Mon Frère.
SK1205,385,Yeah, it definitely will.
SK1205,386,By the way, aren't you going to tell me where we're going?
SK1205,387,Well... That's! A! Secret! Heeheehee!
SK1205,388,Hey, Iris. Sorry to barge in.
SK1205,389,Ah, Mon Frère! Welcome!
SK1205,390,I was just writing a letter to my papa and mama.
SK1205,391,About our spring play, about our last battle...
SK1205,392,Heheh, I have so much to write about, I don't even know where to begin!
SK1205,393,Hahaha, I see.
SK1205,394,All right, then, Iris, I'll get out of your hair. Good luck with your letter.
SK1205,395,Thanks, Mon Frère! See you later! Bye-byyyye!
SK1205,396,Iris said she was writing a letter.
SK1205,397,I don't want to bother her, plus I've got someone waiting on me, so I'll just go.
SK1205,398,Kohran? It's Ogami.
SK1205,399,Oh, Chief? I've been waiting for ya! C'mon in.
SK1205,400,OK, then. Excuse me...
SK1205,401,I should be fine dressed like this if we're just going to an amusement park, right?
SK1205,402,Yep. Best to wear something a bit more flexible.
SK1205,403,After all, we're gonna go on one heck of a ride.
SK1205,404,One heck of a ride"?
SK1205,405,I designed it during my time at Hanayashiki, just for such an occasion.
SK1205,406,I call it... The Fun-derstrike!
SK1205,407,The... Fun-derstrike?
SK1205,408,That... sure sounds like one heck of a ride, all right.
SK1205,409,Now that the fighting's over, I'm gonna keep on inventing all sortsa stuff!
SK1205,410,I wanna make people happy with all the stuff I invent.
SK1205,411,I wanna see everyone's smiling faces.
SK1205,412,But most of all, I wanna see YOUR smiling face, Chief.
SK1205,413,Kohran...
SK1205,414,The Fun-derstrike might be a little intense for you the first time around...
SK1205,415,But it's a ton of fun, you'll be addicted once you get used to it!
SK1205,416,I see... Looking forward to it.
SK1205,417,By the way, Kohran, just asking to be sure, but...
SK1205,418,It's not going to explode, right?
SK1205,419,Hahahaha! Relax, Chief! Your safety is guaranteed!
SK1205,420,C'mon, let's get goin'! Next stop: Hanayashiki!
SK1205,421,Kohran? It's Ogami.
SK1205,422,...
SK1205,423,Huh? Doesn't look like Kohran's in her room.
SK1205,424,Orihime? It's Ogami.
SK1205,425,Is that you, Ensign? Please, come in.
SK1205,426,OK, then. Excuse me...
SK1205,427,So, Orihime, what is it you wanted to show me?
SK1205,428,Well, I don't know... Should I show it to you? No, maybe I shouldn't after all...
SK1205,429,O-Orihime... Don't tease me like that.
SK1205,430,Heehee, all right, I'll show you.
SK1205,431,Here it is!
SK1205,432,Is this... From back when...
SK1205,433,That's right! It's the portrait Papa drew at the Imperial Hotel on New Year's!
SK1205,434,You know, the one of us!
SK1205,435,I just received it from Papa yesterday.
SK1205,436,I see... So Ogata finally finished it.
SK1205,437,When he gave it to me, he said, "You came back alive after all..."
SK1205,438,I'm so happy I get to show you this picture."
SK1205,439,...
SK1205,440,Anyway, it's a wonderful portrait, as expected of my papa!
SK1205,441,Yeah... I feel kind of embarrassed looking at a painting of myself, though.
SK1205,442,Really? I've been staring at it all day and can't get enough.
SK1205,443,Looking at this painting brings back so many memories of you...
SK1205,444,Orihime...
SK1205,445,We'll always be together, just like in this portrait.
SK1205,446,Orihime? It's Ogami.
SK1205,447,...
SK1205,448,Hmmm, doesn't seem like she's in her room.
SK1205,449,Ensign.<br>I've been waiting for you.
SK1205,450,What did you need me for, Sumire?
SK1205,451,Ensign... Do you remember the promise you made aboard the Mikasa?
SK1205,452,You promised me you'd join me for a shopping trip once we got back from that battle.
SK1205,453,There's just so many dresses... I'd like to go buy them right away.
SK1205,454,I see, so that's what this is all about.
SK1205,455,If you want me to, then sure, I'd love to tag along.
SK1205,456,Ensign... My deepest thanks.
SK1205,457,I don't know how useful I'll be for helping you pick out dresses, though.
SK1205,458,Oh, that's not why you're coming along.
SK1205,459,You're going to help carry my things! Ohohohoho!
SK1205,460,Oh brother... I figured as much.
SK1205,461,...
SK1205,462,Actually... I couldn't care less about shopping.
SK1205,463,I'm perfectly happy just being able to spend time with you.
SK1205,464,Hm? Did you say something, Sumire?
SK1205,465,N-No, nothing at all! Ohohohoho!
SK1205,466,Now then, Ensign, shall we get going?
SK1205,467,My, Ensign. You seem busy as ever.
SK1205,468,And I see you're gracefully enjoying your tea, as usual.
SK1205,469,Indeed. There's nothing quite like a cup of tea after a hard day's work.
SK1205,470,Besides, I always feel the most at ease when I'm sitting right here and drinking my tea.
SK1205,471,Hahaha, I see.
SK1205,472,All right, I'll be going, then.
SK1205,473,Very well. Good day, Ensign.
SK1205,474,My, Ensign. Aimlessly wandering around as usual, I see.
SK1205,475,You should relax and enjoy a nice cup of tea every once in a while.
SK1205,476,Haha... Well, I suppose you're right.
SK1205,477,All right, I'll take you up on your offer sometime.
SK1205,478,It would be my pleasure. Come to the salon whenever you'd like.
SK1205,479,The sunlight's so warm...
SK1205,480,The day I came back to the Imperial Theater was also a warm spring day, wasn't it?
SK1205,481,It's almost been a whole year since then already...
SK1205,482,Oh, Captain.
SK1205,483,Hey, Maria. What were you doing?
SK1205,484,Oh, I was just... gazing at the streets.
SK1205,485,They're the same streets as always... The same view as always...
SK1205,486,But... It's perhaps the most relieving view I can imagine.
SK1205,487,Maria...
SK1205,488,I'll stay here for a little while longer.
SK1205,489,I see. All right, Maria, see you later.
SK1205,490,What's wrong, Captain? You keep coming to the terrace.
SK1205,491,Nothing, just kinda wound up here.
SK1205,492,Hm hm, I see.
SK1205,493,Captain, let's keep doing our best to defend this city.
SK1205,494,Yeah...
SK1205,495,We had our spring production right after the battle ended. We've sure been busy up till now. 
SK1205,496,At least now I've got a little more free time, so maybe I'll kick back and read a book later.
SK1205,497,The sunlight's pouring in through the window.
SK1205,498,It's looking like a beautiful spring day today.
SK1205,499,Maria? It's Ogami.
SK1205,500,...
SK1205,501,Doesn't look like she's in. Oh well, I'll go somewhere else.
SK1205,502,Actually, wait, she said she would be waiting for me by the entrance, didn't she?
SK1205,503,Sakura, are you there? It's Ogami.
SK1205,504,...
SK1205,505,Doesn't look like she's in. Hmmm... Wonder where she's run off to?
SK1205,506,Actually, wait, she said she would be waiting for me by the entrance, didn't she?
SK1205,507,Kanna, are you there?
SK1205,508,...
SK1205,509,No answer. Guess she's not here.
SK1205,510,Sumire? It's Ogami.
SK1205,511,...
SK1205,512,Doesn't look like she's in her room.
SK1205,513,Even though the fighting's over, the Imperial Assault Troupe's work never ends.
SK1205,514,We've got to keep working together to keep putting on great plays.
SK1205,515,Arf, arf!
SK1205,516,Oh, that sounds like
SK1205,517,!
SK1205,518,You came to the theater in July of last year, right?
SK1205,519,Arf!
SK1205,520,A lot's happened in just half a year.
SK1205,521,Bet you never thought you'd ever be flying in the Mikasa, did you?
SK1205,522,Now you're a full-fledged part of the team, too. Keep up the good work.
SK1205,523,Arf, arf, arf!
SK1205,524,Huh? Did
SK1205,525,run off somewhere?
SK1205,526,Eh, I'm sure he's fine. He's probably running around in the theater somewhere.
SK1205,527,To think this theater can transform and become a part of the Mikasa...
SK1205,528,Hard to believe when you see an attic made of wood like this.
SK1205,529,It's thanks to the Koubu that we were able to seize victory.
SK1205,530,Thank you, Koubu.<br>You can rest now.
SK1205,531,Oh, well if it isn't the Chief.
SK1205,532,Kohran?<br>Still working on the Koubu even though the fight's over?
SK1205,533,Yep.<br>They need maintenance now more than ever, after a job like that.
SK1205,534,The Koubu and the Tenbu...<br>They all did great.
SK1205,535,Now they get to take a little break while they heal their wounds.
SK1205,536,I see, so they're on vacation for a little while.
SK1205,537,All right, Kohran, I'm gonna go. Keep up the good work.
SK1205,538,Thanks a bunch, Chief! See ya!
SK1205,539,I don't see Kohran anywhere. She must be under a Koubu, fixing it up.
SK1205,540,I wouldn't want to get in the way of her work, so I'll go somewhere else.
SK1205,541,Hello, everyone.
SK1205,542,Ensign Ogami! Fabulous work in that last battle!
SK1205,543,You managed to topple both Musashi and Kyogoku without a single casualty... Beautiful, simply beautiful!
SK1205,544,R-Right... Thank you.
SK1205,545,That's my Ichiro! I knew we could count on you!
SK1205,546,Now, let me give you a smooch as your reward!
SK1205,547,Waaaahhhh! H-Heeelp!
SK1205,548,So now... peace has... finally returned.
SK1205,549,But unfortunately... we have to say... goodbye...
SK1205,550,G-Goodbye?
SK1205,551,Yes. Now that Kyogoku is dead, we're to return to the army to help get it up and running again.
SK1205,552,Our time together was brief, but we are truly in your debt.
SK1205,553,I see...
SK1205,554,Let's both do what we can to protect the peace of this city.
SK1205,555,Ensign Ogami. Never forget the Rose Division, secret unit of love and beauty.
SK1205,556,Let's have our passionate smooch next time, Ichiro!
SK1205,557,Ogami... No matter how far apart we may be... we'll always be rooting for you.
SK1205,558,...Thank you.
SK1205,559,All right, everyone, take care! Goodbye!
SK1205,560,Let's go, everybody!
SK1205,561,Hooray, hooray, Ogami!<br>Hooray, hooray, Ogami!<br>Waaahhh! (I feel so emotional! Again!!)
SK1205,562,I'll take this chair, so if you could grab that one, Yokihiko.
SK1205,563,Ooooh, I can't carry something this big!
SK1205,564,What are you saying, Yokihiko? You of all people could carry that singlehandedly.
SK1205,565,Oh, Kotone, sir! How could you be so cruel to me when I'm grieving!
SK1205,566,(Looks like they're in the middle of moving out...)
SK1205,567,(Despite everything, I think I'm actually going to miss having them around.)
SK1205,568,During the coup d'etat attempt, the revolutionary army blasted through this wall.
SK1205,569,It's been several months since then, and now we finally have true peace.
SK1205,570,Even though the fighting's over, I've got to make sure to stay in shape.
SK1205,571,I'd better keep coming here to exercise every now and then.
SK1205,572,I remember coming in here and getting flustered at seeing other people bathing...
SK1205,573,It was pretty hectic, but looking back on it, it makes for some nice memories.
SK1205,574,I should swim in here on occasion and train my body.
SK1205,575,Both fighting and ticket punching require stamina. It's important to work hard every day.
SK1205,576,There's nothing like the feeling of a hot bath after coming back from a battle...
SK1205,577,It really drives home the fact that you're back at the theater.
SK1205,578,I'm so glad we didn't suffer any major casualties in that last battle.
SK1205,579,I'll have to keep trying my hardest to protect everyone in the Flower Division.
SK1205,580,We've had a lot of strategy meetings in this room, even aboard the Mikasa.
SK1205,581,Now that the fighting's over, I don't think we'll be using this room for a while.
SK1205,582,The fighting might be over, but the steam processor keeps on working, as always.
SK1205,583,We'll both need to keep working hard to protect the peace.
SK1205,584,Sorry, Ogami, but each customer is only allowed to purchase one photo at a time.
SK1205,585,I see. That's too bad.
SK1205,586,Sorry, Ogami, but each customer is only allowed to purchase one photo at a time.

SK1301,1,A month had passed since then...
SK1301,2,It was a bright spring day like any other.
SK1301,3,
SK1301,4,Strange for Mr. Yoneda to summon me out of the blue like this...
SK1301,5,What could he want with me?
SK1301,6,Ah, Ogami?
SK1301,7,Sakura? What are you doing here?
SK1301,8,Mr. Yoneda told me to come here right away.
SK1301,9,Huh?! I actually got called down here too...
SK1301,10,Huh?! You too, Ogami?
SK1301,11,Hmmm... What's this all about?
SK1301,12,Anyway, let's just hear what the manager has to say.
SK1301,13,Oh my, is that you, Ensign?
SK1301,14,Sumire? What are you doing here?
SK1301,15,I received an urgent summons from Mr. Yoneda.
SK1301,16,Huh, you too? I was also called down here by the manager.
SK1301,17,Well now... What could this be about?
SK1301,18,Hmm... Let's hear what the manager has to say.
SK1301,19,...Captain?
SK1301,20,Is that you, Maria? What are you doing here?
SK1301,21,Yes, Mr. Yoneda summoned me to his office.
SK1301,22,Huh, you too? I was also called down here by the manager.
SK1301,23,Huh?! You too, sir?
SK1301,24,Hmm, why'd he call the two of us down at the same time?
SK1301,25,Anyway, let's just hear what the manager has to say.
SK1301,26,Huh? Well if it ain't the Boss.
SK1301,27,Yo, Boss. What are you doing here?
SK1301,28,I actually just got called down to meet with Mr. Yoneda.
SK1301,29,Huh, you too? I also got asked to come down to the manager's office.
SK1301,30,So he called for you too, huh?
SK1301,31,What's the big idea, calling for the both of us at the same time?
SK1301,32,Anyway, let's just hear what the manager has to say.
SK1301,33,Ah, Mon Frère!
SK1301,34,What are you doing here?
SK1301,35,I was actually called down here by Mr. Yoneda...
SK1301,36,Huh, you too, Mon Frère?! Uncle Yoneda called me down here too.
SK1301,37,Huh, really? Hmmm... What's this all about?
SK1301,38,Hey, what do you think he wants to talk about? Heheh, now I'm curious!
SK1301,39,Hahaha... Let's go inside for now.
SK1301,40,Oh? Well if it ain't the Chief.
SK1301,41,Whatcha doing here, anyway?
SK1301,42,Did you get in trouble and the manager's making you stand outside his office?
SK1301,43,O-Of course not! I'm not in grade school!
SK1301,44,I was summoned by Mr. Yoneda. Don't know what for, though.
SK1301,45,Say what?! Yoneda called me here too.
SK1301,46,Huh... Wonder why he called for both of us at the same time.
SK1301,47,Kinda intriguing, huh? Anyway, we should hear what he has to say.
SK1301,48,You're right. OK, let's head inside.
SK1301,49,Ah, Ensiiign!
SK1301,50,Hey, Orihime. What are you doing here?
SK1301,51,Yoneda called me here. I don't know what for, though.
SK1301,52,Huh?! I actually got called down here too...
SK1301,53,Huh?! You too, Ensign?
SK1301,54,If he called for you too, then... What could this be about?
SK1301,55,Maybe... He wants us to get married or something?
SK1301,56,I-I don't think that's it...
SK1301,57,Anyway, let's go inside.
SK1301,58,...Captain?
SK1301,59,Hey, Reni. What are you doing here?
SK1301,60,I was called here by Mr. Yoneda.
SK1301,61,Huh? So was I, actually...
SK1301,62,...You too, sir?
SK1301,63,What could the manager want to have called us at the same time?
SK1301,64,Anyway, let's go inside and hear what he has to say.
SK1301,65,Mr. Yoneda, it's Ogami.
SK1301,66,Oh, you're here? Come on in.
SK1301,67,Right. Pardon me.
SK1301,68,Oh, so you two decided to show up together.
SK1301,69,Yes, we ran into each other outside your office.
SK1301,70,Indeed, we happened to meet just outside your office.
SK1301,71,Yes, we just so happened to meet outside your office.
SK1301,72,Yeah, we ran into each other outside your office.
SK1301,73,Uh-huh! We ran into each other right in front of your door!
SK1301,74,Yep, that's right. Just so happened to bump into each other outside your office.
SK1301,75,That's right. We ran into each other before coming inside.
SK1301,76,We ran into each other just now.
SK1301,77,I see...
SK1301,78,Actually, there's two things I wanted to tell the both of you.
SK1301,79,Huh, what could that be?
SK1301,80,Ogami. As of today, you've been promoted to the rank of Navy Lieutenant, Junior Grade.
SK1301,81,Huh?!<br>Me?<br>Lieutenant Junior Grade?!
SK1301,82,Ogami, your combat record this past year has been truly exceptional.
SK1301,83,The navy is extremely impressed with how you led the Troupe to victory while minimizing casualties.
SK1301,84,Heheh, so, whaddaya think?
SK1301,85,I'll give it my all! Until my very last breath!
SK1301,86,This still doesn't feel real...
SK1301,87,Yessir! I'll give it my all! Until my very last breath!
SK1301,88,Whoa, whoa, still as uptight as ever, huh?
SK1301,89,Well, I guess that's just how you are.
SK1301,90,Y-Yes, sir.
SK1301,91,To be perfectly honest, sir, this still doesn't feel real.
SK1301,92,Well, this is kind of sudden, can't say I blame you.
SK1301,93,But as your commanding officer, I can vouch for your past achievements and future potential.
SK1301,94,At any rate, you just gotta have faith in yourself. Keep it up, Ogami.
SK1301,95,Y-Yes, sir.
SK1301,96,...Your answer, Ogami?
SK1301,97,Ah... S-Sorry, this is all so sudden, my mind kind of went blank...
SK1301,98,Wahahaha!<br>Totally dumbfounded by that news, eh?
SK1301,99,But I guess that's pretty typical for you.
SK1301,100,Just keep it up, in your own way. Don't overexert yourself.
SK1301,101,Y-Yes, sir.
SK1301,102,Congratulations, Ogami.
SK1301,103,I'm so glad all your hard work's finally paid off.
SK1301,104,Sakura... Thank you.
SK1301,105,Congratulations, Ensign.
SK1301,106,I'm glad your hard work has finally been recognized.
SK1301,107,Hold on there, Sumire. Ogami's not an Ensign anymore, he's a lieutenant now.
SK1301,108,O-Oh my, my mistake... Force of habit...
SK1301,109,...Lieutenant. Once again, congratulations.
SK1301,110,Sumire... Thanks.
SK1301,111,Congratulations, Captain.
SK1301,112,Maria... Thank you.
SK1301,113,Thinking about all you've done, this was long overdue.
SK1301,114,I hope you remain just as excellent of a captain.
SK1301,115,Awright! That's awesome, Boss!
SK1301,116,So you're a big fancy navy lieutenant now, huh? Way to go!
SK1301,117,Kanna... Thank you.
SK1301,118,Loo-ten-int... Is that better than ensign?
SK1301,119,Yeah, it's one rank higher. Ogami's moving on up.
SK1301,120,I get it! Mon Frère's becoming important now, huh!
SK1301,121,Congratulations, Mon Frère! I'm happy for you too!
SK1301,122,Iris... Thank you.
SK1301,123,Not bad, Chief! Way to go, getting promoted to lieutenant!
SK1301,124,Well, this was way overdue anyway. For real, congrats!
SK1301,125,Kohran... Thanks.
SK1301,126,That's amazing, Ensign! I guess I have to start calling you "Lieutenant" now, huh?
SK1301,127,Lieutenant... Congratulations!
SK1301,128,Thanks, Orihime. Hahaha... You're making me blush.
SK1301,129,That's great, Captain.
SK1301,130,I'm glad your hard work's being recognized, sir.
SK1301,131,Reni... Thanks.
SK1301,132,...
SK1301,133,By the way, sir, what was the other thing you wanted to tell us?
SK1301,134,...Right. The truth is, the powers that be have decided to invest in your future.
SK1301,135,Listen up, Ogami.<br>You've been selected for the personnel exchange program.
SK1301,136,You are to be sent to Europe to study... To Paris, France.
SK1301,137,Huh?!
SK1301,138,Then that means...<br>Ogami...
SK1301,139,Th-That means...<br>It can't be...
SK1301,140,Th-Then that means...
SK1301,141,Wh-What?! Hold on, you don't mean...
SK1301,142,Huh?!<br>Then...<br>Then Mon Frère...
SK1301,143,S-Say what?!<br>Then that means the Chief's...
SK1301,144,P-Paris?!<br>Then that means... No...
SK1301,145,So... In other words...
SK1301,146,...That's right. He'll be leaving the theater.
SK1301,147,I don't know when he'll be back...<br>I'm afraid you two will be apart for a long time.
SK1301,148,No...
SK1301,149,No...
SK1301,150,...
SK1301,151,Wha...<br>What the hell...
SK1301,152,No...<br>No, I won't let him!
SK1301,153,Chief...
SK1301,154,No... That can't be...
SK1301,155,Captain...
SK1301,156,...
SK1301,157,Ogami.<br>Go see the world.<br>Broaden your horizons and grow.
SK1301,158,What'll we do, Sakura?
SK1301,159,Sakura... What do we do?
SK1301,160,I understand that you don't want to leave Sakura or the Flower Division.
SK1301,161,I don't want to leave the theater, the Flower Division or Sakura!
SK1301,162,What'll we do, Sumire?
SK1301,163,Sumire... What do we do?
SK1301,164,I understand that you don't want to leave Sumire or the Flower Division.
SK1301,165,I don't want to leave the theater, the Flower Division or Sumire!
SK1301,166,What'll we do, Maria?
SK1301,167,Maria... What do we do?
SK1301,168,I understand that you don't want to leave Maria or the Flower Division.
SK1301,169,I don't want to leave the theater, the Flower Division or Maria!
SK1301,170,What'll we do, Kanna?
SK1301,171,Kanna... What do we do?
SK1301,172,I understand that you don't want to leave Kanna or the Flower Division.
SK1301,173,I don't want to leave the theater, the Flower Division or Kanna!
SK1301,174,What'll we do, Iris?
SK1301,175,Iris... What do we do?
SK1301,176,I understand that you don't want to leave Iris or the Flower Division.
SK1301,177,I don't want to leave the theater, the Flower Division or Iris!
SK1301,178,What'll we do, Kohran?
SK1301,179,Kohran... What do we do?
SK1301,180,I understand that you don't want to leave Kohran or the Flower Division.
SK1301,181,I don't want to leave the theater, the Flower Division or Kohran!
SK1301,182,What'll we do, Orihime?
SK1301,183,Orihime... What do we do?
SK1301,184,I understand that you don't want to leave Orihime or the Flower Division.
SK1301,185,I don't want to leave the theater, the Flower Division or Orihime!
SK1301,186,What'll we do, Reni?
SK1301,187,Reni... What do we do?
SK1301,188,I understand that you don't want to leave Reni or the Flower Division.
SK1301,189,I don't want to leave the theater, the Flower Division or Reni!
SK1301,190,...I understand.
SK1301,191,...I don't want to go.
SK1301,192,...I understand.
SK1301,193,It'll be hard to leave everyone in the Flower Division behind... But I'll go.
SK1301,194,Ogami...
SK1301,195,...
SK1301,196,Captain...
SK1301,197,Boss...
SK1301,198,Mon Frère...
SK1301,199,...
SK1301,200,...
SK1301,201,...
SK1301,202,...I see. Well said, Ogami.
SK1301,203,I know you'll exceed everyone's expectations.
SK1301,204,I... don't want to go.
SK1301,205,Ogami, you dumbass!<br>Don't be a spoiled brat!
SK1301,206,Are the theater and the Flower Division all you care about? Are they all you have to protect?!
SK1301,207,Have you forgotten your duty to protect the lives and happiness of the people?!
SK1301,208,Mr. Yoneda...
SK1301,209,Our fight never truly ends.<br>We have to keep protecting this peace.
SK1301,210,So please, Ogami, try to understand. We're counting on you.
SK1301,211,...
SK1301,212,I-I...
SK1301,213,...
SK1301,214,...
SK1301,215,I-I...
SK1301,216,NO!<br>I wanna be with Mon Frère!
SK1301,217,I-I...
SK1301,218,I-I...
SK1301,219,...
SK1301,220,Ogami...
SK1301,221,However, I want you to remember something, Ogami.
SK1301,222,It's not just this theater or the Flower Division we're protecting.
SK1301,223,Protecting the lives and happiness of the people... That's the sworn duty of the Imperial Assault Troupe.
SK1301,224,Mr. Yoneda...
SK1301,225,Our fight never truly ends.<br>We have to keep protecting this peace.
SK1301,226,So please, Ogami, try to understand.
SK1301,227,...
SK1301,228,...
SK1301,229,I know this is all rather sudden. I don't blame you for being at a loss right now.
SK1301,230,However, I want you to remember something, Ogami.
SK1301,231,It's not just this theater or the Flower Division we're protecting.
SK1301,232,Protecting the lives and happiness of the people... That's the sworn duty of the Imperial Assault Troupe.
SK1301,233,Mr. Yoneda...
SK1301,234,Our fight never truly ends.<br>We have to keep protecting this peace.
SK1301,235,So please, Ogami, try to understand.
SK1301,236,...
SK1301,237,Your departure date is one week from now. You'll be setting off from Yokohama harbor.
SK1301,238,Make all the necessary preparations for your trip, Ogami.
SK1301,239,Sakura...
SK1301,240,So... It looks like we have to be apart again...
SK1301,241,...
SK1301,242,But... I know that going to France...
SK1301,243,I know it'll be good for you, Ogami.
SK1301,244,So please, Ogami... Go to France.
SK1301,245,I'll be... all right.
SK1301,246,...Sakura?
SK1301,247,I'm sorry!<br>I know I...<br>I know I shouldn't cry!
SK1301,248,I know I shouldn't cry as you're about to leave, but...!
SK1301,249,Sakura...
SK1301,250,...
SK1301,251,So... We must part once again, Ensign.
SK1301,252,Oh... My apologies.<br>It's not Ensign anymore, is it? It's Lieutenant.
SK1301,253,I'll have to get used to calling you that... and get used to your absence.
SK1301,254,Sumire...
SK1301,255,Lieutenant. Go... Go to France.
SK1301,256,I came to this theater because I believed in my own path in life.
SK1301,257,By the same token, I have no intention of holding you back.
SK1301,258,...
SK1301,259,...I'll be all right.
SK1301,260,My parents... My grandfather... And you most of all. You all taught me something.
SK1301,261,No matter how far apart we may be... We can still be together in our hearts.
SK1301,262,Sumire...
SK1301,263,Congratulations, Captain.
SK1301,264,It's wonderful that you get to study in France.
SK1301,265,But... That means we have to be apart.
SK1301,266,...
SK1301,267,I'd be lying if I said I wasn't also sad.
SK1301,268,But this is a great opportunity for you.
SK1301,269,It was the same for me. Getting to visit a foreign country can be a great experience.
SK1301,270,...
SK1301,271,...I'll be all right.
SK1301,272,After all, this doesn't mean we'll never see each other again.
SK1301,273,Besides, whenever I feel lonely... I'll always have my locket.
SK1301,274,Maria...
SK1301,275,...
SK1301,276,This is all so sudden, I have no idea what to say...
SK1301,277,Kanna...
SK1301,278,Well, now that I think about it, I did ditch you to go train in Okinawa...
SK1301,279,So I guess now it's your turn to go train in France.
SK1301,280,...
SK1301,281,Well if you're gonna go, then give it everything you got while you're there!
SK1301,282,You don't have to worry about the theater while I'm here.
SK1301,283,I can't wait to see you lookin' big and strong after all that training, Boss!
SK1301,284,Kanna...
SK1301,285,*sob*...<br>Eh... Eh...
SK1301,286,Iris...
SK1301,287,I wanna stay with you, Mon Frère...
SK1301,288,I don't want you to leave...
SK1301,289,...
SK1301,290,You promised me when you came back, remember?!
SK1301,291,You said you'd never leave me again... You said we'd be together forever...
SK1301,292,I'm staying with you forever, no matter what!
SK1301,293,I don't care if you're going to France or whatever!
SK1301,294,Iris...
SK1301,295,Congrats, Chief.
SK1301,296,You get to go study in France... Way to go.
SK1301,297,...
SK1301,298,I always knew this day would come.
SK1301,299,A guy like you was always bound to spread your wings and see the world.
SK1301,300,Kohran...
SK1301,301,...
SK1301,302,...
SK1301,303,Nope...<br>I just... can't do it...
SK1301,304,I wanna be all happy and cheerful about this, but...
SK1301,305,No matter how hard I try... The tears won't stop welling up.
SK1301,306,My head understands... But my heart isn't having any of it.
SK1301,307,Kohran...
SK1301,308,...
SK1301,309,Orihime...
SK1301,310,I thought we'd get to make all kinds of fun memories together from here on out...
SK1301,311,But now we... have to be apart...
SK1301,312,...
SK1301,313,But even when Papa and Mamma were far apart...
SK1301,314,They never stopped thinking about each other.
SK1301,315,And I'll always be thinking about you, Ensign.
SK1301,316,Orihime...
SK1301,317,I wish I could've met you sooner...
SK1301,318,And I wish I could've stayed with you longer.
SK1301,319,...
SK1301,320,Reni...
SK1301,321,I wanted to go to all kinds of places with you...
SK1301,322,I wanted you to teach me more things.
SK1301,323,...
SK1301,324,But Europe is more advanced than Japan in a lot of ways...
SK1301,325,So I know you'll see great results from your studies there.
SK1301,326,I see...
SK1301,327,...
SK1301,328,There is... something new I've just learned.
SK1301,329,I learned... how hard it can be... to say goodbye.
SK1301,330,Reni...
SK1301,331,The following week was spent preparing for the trip.
SK1301,332,The time passed in an instant.
SK1301,333,And then...<br>The day before departure...
SK1301,334,As you're all aware, Ogami's finally leaving for Paris tomorrow.
SK1301,335,Ogami, if you could say something to everyone.
SK1301,336,...
SK1301,337,Express your resolve
SK1301,338,Address everyone
SK1301,339,It's hard saying goodbye to everyone, but I've decided to go to France.
SK1301,340,I will use this opportunity to see a whole new world and test myself.
SK1301,341,I don't know what France has in store for me...
SK1301,342,But as a member of the Imperial Assault Troupe, just like all of you, I will do my absolute best.
SK1301,343,Sakura... Sumire... Maria... Kanna...
SK1301,344,Iris... Kohran... Orihime... And Reni...
SK1301,345,I truly enjoyed this past year I spent with all of you.
SK1301,346,I may be leaving for France tomorrow...
SK1301,347,But I'll never forget the memories I made with you for as long as I live.
SK1301,348,...
SK1301,349,Thank you so much, everyone.
SK1301,350,There's nothing I need to say to all of you...
SK1301,351,I believe in you, that even while I'm in France, you'll be more than able to protect the capital.
SK1301,352,And I know the day will come when I'll get to see you all again.
SK1301,353,Until then... We'll have to be apart for a while.
SK1301,354,But I'll never forget the memories I made with you for as long as I live.
SK1301,355,...
SK1301,356,Thank you so much, everyone.
SK1301,357,...
SK1301,358,Now it's all your turn to say something to Ogami.
SK1301,359,Captain, you don't have to worry about the Flower Division.
SK1301,360,We'll keep working hard, with your words in our hearts.
SK1301,361,Take care of yourself, all right, Chief?
SK1301,362,You'll have to tell me all about how it is over there sometime.
SK1301,363,No matter how far apart we may be...
SK1301,364,Our hearts will always be as one.
SK1301,365,Uhh... *sob*... Mon Frère...
SK1301,366,Come, now, Iris, don't cry.
SK1301,367,Mon Frère... Don't forget about me... OK?
SK1301,368,I'll always... Always...
SK1301,369,*sob*... Uhh...
SK1301,370,It's OK, Iris. There's no way the Boss would forget about us.
SK1301,371,Heheh, you better not half-ass your training while you're in France, Boss.
SK1301,372,I want you to come back even stronger and more reliable than you are now.
SK1301,373,And while you're there...
SK1301,374,Do your best to become a proper Parisian gentleman.
SK1301,375,You taught me so much, Captain.
SK1301,376,I'll never forget any of it for as long as I live.
SK1301,377,I'm sure the day will come when we'll be able to see each other again.
SK1301,378,We'll keep working hard until that day comes.
SK1301,379,Ogami... Have a safe trip.
SK1301,380,Everyone... Thanks.
SK1301,381,All right! Now that we've congratulated Ogami on his promotion and transfer to France...
SK1301,382,It's time for Ogami's going-away party! Now let's party hard!
SK1301,383,Awright! Let's have fun, people! For the Boss!
SK1301,384,The going-away party was so much fun. Even Kasumi and the others joined in.
SK1301,385,I'm finally setting off tomorrow.
SK1301,386,Tonight's the last night I'll be spending at the Imperial Theater...
SK1301,387,Hm? Who could that be, at this hour?
SK1301,388,Could it be...
SK1301,389,Ogami...
SK1301,390,Sakura...

SK1301,414,Maria... Thank you.

SK1301,421,Kanna...

SK1301,442,What's this?
SK1301,443,It's a letter I wrote... For you.
SK1301,444,Um... It's kind of embarrassing, so wait till you're on the boat to read it, 'kay?
SK1301,445,Kohran... Thanks.
SK1301,446,All right then, night, Chief.
SK1301,447,Kohran...
SK1301,448,Oh thank goodness, you're still up, Lieutenant.
SK1301,449,Orihime...
SK1301,450,Um... I actually have something for you.
SK1301,451,Something for me?
SK1301,452,What's this?
SK1301,453,It's a letter I wrote... For you.
SK1301,454,Read it once you're on the boat to France.
SK1301,455,Orihime... Thank you.
SK1301,456,All right, then, Lieutenant... Good night.
SK1301,457,Orihime...
SK1301,458,Reni...
SK1301,459,I... wrote you a letter.
SK1301,460,Huh? A letter? For me?
SK1301,461,Yeah. Here it is...
SK1301,462,Reni...
SK1301,463,I've never written a letter to anybody before...
SK1301,464,But if you could read it once you're on the boat... That would make me happy.
SK1301,465,Thank you, Reni. I'll make sure to read it.
SK1301,466,OK...
SK1301,467,Well then, Captain... Good night.
SK1301,468,Reni...
SK1301,469,OK...<br>That's all my bags, packed and ready.
SK1301,470,Time to say goodbye to this room, I guess...
SK1301,471,...
SK1301,472,Right... Time to go.
SK1301,473,Ogamiii! Hold on a second!
SK1301,474,...Kayama?!
SK1301,475,Ogami, are you really leaving this early?
SK1301,476,Heading out alone so that you won't make the others feel sad, I take it?
SK1301,477,...
SK1301,478,No proverb today, Kayama?
SK1301,479,No. A man doesn't need words when he's about to embark on a journey.
SK1301,480,Till we meet again...<br>Ogami.
SK1301,481,...Yeah. See you, Kayama.
SK1301,482,I guess this means goodbye for now... Grand Imperial Theater.
SK1301,483,...
SK1301,484,Goodbye...<br>Everyone.
SK1301,485,I'm writing to you today as the cherry blossoms in the capital are in full bloom. It truly is peaceful.
SK1301,486,Congratulations again on your promotion to Lieutenant Junior Grade, Ogami.
SK1301,487,As I write this letter, I can't help but remember when we first met in Ueno during the spring.
SK1301,488,It's hard to say goodbye, but I'll always carry in my heart the joy I felt at that moment.
SK1301,489,I wish I could join you on your trip to Paris...
SK1301,490,But I don't think you'd be very happy if I did.
SK1301,491,You always keep moving forward, so I'll follow your example and keep working hard in the Flower Division.
SK1301,492,I'll keep improving myself so that I can be the Sakura you deserve.
SK1301,493,I'll always cherish the memories I shared with you and the things I learned from you.
SK1301,494,I'll write you plenty of letters, and I'll keep your room clean.
SK1301,495,Have a safe trip. I eagerly await your return.
SK1301,496,Sincerely,<br>Imperial Assault Troupe, Flower Division<br>Sakura Shinguji
SK1301,497,Dear Lieutenant,<br>Congratulations on your promotion.
SK1301,498,I have found myself unable to sleep at night ever since I heard you were leaving for Paris.
SK1301,499,However, I realize I'm the top star of the Flower Division.
SK1301,500,I'm sure you'd laugh at me if I just kept moping around forever.
SK1301,501,That's why I've decided-- and don't act surprised--
SK1301,502,That through my acting, I'm going to secure the Flower Division a performance in Europe.
SK1301,503,Then all of Europe will see what I am truly capable of.
SK1301,504,Ahh, I can hear their cheers already...
SK1301,505,Then you'll finally get to reunite with Europe's top star in Paris, the city of flowers.
SK1301,506,Doesn't that sound romantic? But until then...
SK1301,507,We will have to be apart for a while. Stay safe, and take care of yourself.
SK1301,508,Best,<br>Imperial Assault Troupe, Flower Division<br>Sumire Kanzaki
SK1301,509,My dear Captain Ogami,<br>Congratulations on your promotion to Lieutenant Junior Grade.
SK1301,510,You're leaving for Paris tomorrow on a special assignment. I'm going to miss you.
SK1301,511,But don't worry. I'm not going to complain.
SK1301,512,No matter how far apart we may be, our hearts are connected.
SK1301,513,I know one can only taste the joys of spring after braving the harsh winter.
SK1301,514,You can leave the Flower Division to me. I will not falter anymore.
SK1301,515,The Flower Division is my motherland now.
SK1301,516,The future of Japan rests on your shoulders, Captain. Study hard and come back to us.
SK1301,517,The water in Europe isn't very clean, so do be careful.
SK1301,518,I'll be praying for your safety and success, from the bottom of my heart.
SK1301,519,P.S. I've started learning how to swim. Perhaps we can swim together someday.
SK1301,520,Yours truly from the capital,<br>Imperial Assault Troupe, Flower Division<br>Maria Tachibana
SK1301,521,Yo! Congrats on the promotion to lieutenant. I'm just as happy for you as I'd be for myself.
SK1301,522,I was shocked to hear you were leaving for Paris so soon. I'm gonna miss ya.
SK1301,523,The theater without you is like a hinomaru bento without the plum.
SK1301,524,But it's thanks to you that we all learned to trust in each other...
SK1301,525,So even while you're gone, we'll stick together and protect the capital.
SK1301,526,You don't have to worry about a thing, Boss. Just study up in Paris and come back to us.
SK1301,527,That way you can teach us even more stuff.
SK1301,528,In Okinawa, we've got the legend of Nirai Kanai. It's about a paradise off in the west.
SK1301,529,I hope Paris winds up being your Nirai Kanai.
SK1301,530,No matter when, no matter where, you'll always be our captain.
SK1301,531,I'm rooting for you, from the bottom of my heart. Never give up! I'll always be in your corner!
SK1301,532,See ya later.<br>Imperial Assault Troupe, Flower Division<br>Kanna Kirishima
SK1301,533,I'm in my room right now, writing you this letter.
SK1301,534,I'm really gonna miss you while you're away in Paris, Mon Frère.
SK1301,535,I'm totally against it! You shouldn't have to go to Paris at all!
SK1301,536,I've cried about it so much... But I'm a grown up.
SK1301,537,I'm not gonna cry in front of you. I promised Jean-Paul I wouldn't.
SK1301,538,Uncle Yoneda told me this is for your growth.
SK1301,539,I don't get it, though. You can grow no matter where you are, can't you?
SK1301,540,You'd be better off staying here with me, don't you agree?
SK1301,541,I know that's just me being selfish, though.
SK1301,542,Being a grown up means not acting sad even when you really are.
SK1301,543,I'll be brave about it, so write me back, OK? I'll be waiting.
SK1301,544,I love you, Mon Frère.<br>Imperial Assault Troupe, Flower Division<br>Iris
SK1301,545,Dear Chief,<br>So, you're a lieutenant now!<br>For real, congrats.
SK1301,546,I'm really gonna miss you while you're off in Paris, though.
SK1301,547,Hey, what kind of place do you think Paris is? Think they got some neat inventions there?
SK1301,548,Paris, the city of flowers!<br>Paris, capital of the world!<br>Ahh, I wanna go so bad.
SK1301,549,If we ever get the chance, I wanna go exploring the city with you, Chief.
SK1301,550,Oh yeah, I've got a new dream! I'm building an airplane!
SK1301,551,A plane capable of continuous flight around the world. If I ever finish it, I'm coming for ya!
SK1301,552,Then I'll snatch you up, and we'll travel around the world together!
SK1301,553,Ah, jeez.<br>There I go, talking nonsense again.
SK1301,554,But y'know, none of your dreams will come true if you don't work hard for them.
SK1301,555,I'm gonna do my best.<br>You do your best too, Chief.<br>Take care of yourself.
SK1301,556,See you again someday.<br>Imperial Assault Troupe, Flower Division<br>Kohran Li
SK1301,557,Ciao, Ensign.<br>Wait, no, you've been promoted to Lieutenant now, huh?
SK1301,558,Congratulations, and grazie!<br>You're probably reading this on the boat, huh?
SK1301,559,How's the boat ride been so far? Feeling lonely? Want me to come join you?
SK1301,560,Just kidding.<br>I'm busy right now with requests from all over the world to come perform.
SK1301,561,Even though we're so far apart, we're together in our hearts.
SK1301,562,Let's keep working hard, never letting go of our desire to meet with one another.
SK1301,563,Papa and Mamma never stopped loving each other, no matter how far apart they were.
SK1301,564,I know our love, too, can overcome any distance.
SK1301,565,We might even be able to see each other once a year, just like in the Tanabata legend...
SK1301,566,Nevertheless, I can say with confidence that you're one of a kind, Lieutenant.
SK1301,567,And on that note, try not to ogle the Parisian girls too much.
SK1301,568,With love,<br>Imperial Assault Troupe, Flower Division<br>Orihime Soletta
SK1301,569,May 1925.<br>I was transferred to the Imperial Assault Troupe. I met you for the first time.
SK1301,570,August 1925.<br>Together with the Flower Division, I went to a hot spring for the first time.
SK1301,571,So much happened then. I still get a little embarrassed just thinking about it.
SK1301,572,September 1925.<br>You saved me from Suiko's control.
SK1301,573,From the moment I met you, something inside me slowly began to change.
SK1301,574,December 1925.<br>The Christmas play.<br>You picked me to play the lead.
SK1301,575,I celebrated my birthday for the first time ever. I visited a chapel with you. I'll never forget that day.
SK1301,576,January 1926.<br>We spent New Year's alone together, and took part in that final battle.
SK1301,577,A lot has happened in the year I've spent with you. You've changed me, Captain.
SK1301,578,You're a big part of my life now. Perhaps you always will be.
SK1301,579,Congratulations once again on your promotion. I await the day we can meet again.

SK1302,6,*yawn*<br>Ahh, I slept great.
SK1302,7,Today's my first day off in ages.<br>I should take it easy.
SK1302,8,Well, Ogami?<br>Pretty neat, huh?
SK1302,9,Come back down here whenever you want to take another look.
SK1302,10,OK. I'll be going, then.
SK1302,11,Hello, Ogami.
SK1302,12,If you listen to what Mr. Yoneda has to say, you might just learn the trick to getting a high score.
SK1302,13,Well, if you ever feel like using the training unit some more, stop by my room.
SK1302,14,OK. I'll be going, then.
SK1302,15,Hey Kasumi, hey Yuri. What are you two still doing here on your day off?
SK1302,16,Actually, we've been waiting here to tell you something, Ogami.
SK1302,17,Some handy info for spending a fun day off!
SK1302,18,Stop by and ask us whenever you want!
SK1302,19,Ah, Ogami! Here to listen to what we have to say again?
SK1302,20,Shall we tell you what we have to say once more?
SK1302,21,Listen to Kasumi.
SK1302,22,Listen to Yuri.
SK1302,23,Nothing to ask about.
SK1302,24,All right, Kasumi, let's hear what you've got for me.
SK1302,25,Right, understood.
SK1302,26,I'm sure you've already been to a lot of other rooms already, Ogami...
SK1302,27,But you can only talk to and play with the others in places where you made memories with them.
SK1302,28,Then you can relive the experiences you had with them.
SK1302,29,Make lots of memories so you can really enjoy your day off.
SK1302,30,Make lots of memories so you can really enjoy your day off.
SK1302,31,All right, Yuri, let's hear what you've got for me.
SK1302,32,OK, got it!
SK1302,33,Today's your day off, so there's still a lot of memories you can make.
SK1302,34,Make sure to write in the journal in your room, that way you don't forget all these memories.
SK1302,35,Try not to forget about what you played with the others or any of your scores.
SK1302,36,When you go to your room, you ought to be able to "Write in your journal and sleep."
SK1302,37,You should make a habit of going to your room and writing in your journal when you're done for the day.
SK1302,38,When you go to your room, you ought to be able to "Write in your journal and sleep."

SK1302,42,Have a pleasant day off, Ogami.
SK1302,43,Ah, Ogami! Welcome!

SK1302,45,Yessir! I just got some new stock in today!
SK1302,46,They're special photos of the Flower Division, bigger than the normal ones!
SK1302,47,These are just display units, not for sale, but you can take a look if you want.
SK1302,48,Welcome, Ogami! Want to see the extra-large photos?
SK1302,49,Please show me.
SK1302,50,Maybe some other time.
SK1302,51,Wow, that sounds neat. Please, show me.
SK1302,52,OK! Here you go, enjoy!
SK1302,53,Did you enjoy them, Ogami?
SK1302,54,You can look at them again, if you want.
SK1302,55,All right, once more.
SK1302,56,That's enough for now.
SK1302,57,No, that's enough for now. Thanks, Tsubaki.
SK1302,58,I see. Come back whenever you'd like to look at them again!
SK1302,59,Well, if you insist, then sure, I'll look at them once more.
SK1302,60,OK! Feel free to take all the time you'd like!
SK1302,61,I appreciate it, but maybe next time.
SK1302,62,I see. Well, if you ever change your mind, you can stop by whenever!
SK1302,63,Oh, Ogami.
SK1302,64,Kasumi? What are you doing here?
SK1302,65,Sitting here makes me remember all sorts of memories.
SK1302,66,You could join me, if you'd like.
SK1302,67,Oh, Ogami. Care to reminisce with me?
SK1302,68,Reminisce.
SK1302,69,Maybe next time.
SK1302,70,Sure, it's not a bad idea to take a stroll down memory lane every once in a while.
SK1302,71,OK, then close your eyes and try to remember everything that's happened up till now.
SK1302,72,Well, how was it, Ogami?
SK1302,73,I'll stay here a little longer.
SK1302,74,I'll come back later.
SK1302,75,I'll come back when I feel like reminiscing some more.
SK1302,76,I see. Don't hesitate to stop by.
SK1302,77,Man, that was really nostalgic... I think I'll reminisce a little more.
SK1302,78,There's nothing more precious in life than one's memories, huh? Now then, close your eyes again...
SK1302,79,Maybe some other time.
SK1302,80,I see. Don't hesitate to stop by.
SK1302,81,Oh, Ogami.
SK1302,82,Hey, Yuri. Guess you can take it easy today since you don't have work.
SK1302,83,Yep! I was thinking I might listen to some music.
SK1302,84,I know! We could listen to it together, if you'd like?
SK1302,85,Ah, Ogami! If you'd like, maybe we could listen to some music together?
SK1302,86,Listen to music.
SK1302,87,Maybe some other time.
SK1302,88,Yeah, all right, I'll listen to some while I'm here.
SK1302,89,OK! Pick whatever song you'd like, then.
SK1302,90,How was it, Ogami? Want to listen to some more?
SK1302,91,All right, one more time...
SK1302,92,Maybe some other time.
SK1302,93,Maybe some other time. Thanks, Yuri.
SK1302,94,I see. Come back anytime!
SK1302,95,OK, I suppose I'll listen to some more while I'm here.
SK1302,96,OK, got it! What song should we play next?
SK1302,97,I appreciate the offer, but maybe some other time.
SK1302,98,I see.<br>That's too bad.
SK1302,99,You'll have to listen to some the next time you stop by, OK? That's a promise!
SK1302,100,Arf, arf! Woof!
SK1302,101,Oh, Ogami, is that you?
SK1302,102,Are you enjoying your day off too, Kaede?
SK1302,103,Yes. Being out in the yard like this lets me truly enjoy the spring.
SK1302,104,Reflecting back upon the seasons makes for a nice change of mood, you know.
SK1302,105,Oh, back again, Ogami?
SK1302,106,A change of mood might do you some good every now and then.
SK1302,107,Change the mood.
SK1302,108,Maybe next time.
SK1302,109,All right, I could use a little change of mood.
SK1302,110,All right then, just relax and embrace the seasons.
SK1302,111,Let's see, what mood should I go with?
SK1302,112,(How about this one?)
SK1302,113,(Should I keep it as it is now?)
SK1302,114,Go with this mood.
SK1302,115,Think it over some more.
SK1302,116,I should give it some more thought while I have the chance.
SK1302,117,Well, Ogami? Feels nice to reflect upon the seasons, doesn't it?
SK1302,118,Yes it does! Thank you.
SK1302,119,Come back whenever you want a change of mood again.
SK1302,120,Arf, arf, arf!
SK1302,121,Thanks, but maybe some other time. Sorry, Kaede.
SK1302,122,Oh, you don't need to apologize.
SK1302,123,Come back whenever you feel like having a change of mood.
SK1302,124,Arf, arf, arf!
SK1302,125,Hey, Ogami. Got something nice to show ya.
SK1302,126,Something nice? What is it, Mr. Yoneda?
SK1302,127,Yes, it's called the "Spirit Armor Directory."
SK1302,128,It's a brand new device that accurately recreates and plays back the movements of the Kobu Kai and the Tenbu.
SK1302,129,Plus, thanks to the Moon Division's intel, we can also recreate the movements of the Black Demons' Hex Mechs.
SK1302,130,Well, Ogami? Wanna take a look?
SK1302,131,Please, let me see!
SK1302,132,Some other time.
SK1302,133,That's amazing! Please, let me see!
SK1302,134,Heheh, all right. Take a good, hard look at these beauties!
SK1302,135,I'm a little busy right now, so maybe some other time.
SK1302,136,Oh come on, after I went through the trouble of explaining it all? What a party pooper.
SK1302,137,Well, you can come by here and check out the Spirit Armor Directory whenever you want...
SK1302,138,So if the mood ever strikes you, step on down here sometime.
SK1302,139,Right, understood.
SK1302,140,Hey, Ogami. How about taking a look at the Spirit Armory Directory?
SK1302,141,All right, I will.
SK1302,142,Some other time.
SK1302,143,All right, I will!
SK1302,144,OK then, look to your heart's content!
SK1302,145,I appreciate the offer, but maybe some other time.
SK1302,146,Jeez, such a stick in the mud.
SK1302,147,Well make yourself some free time and come back to check it out!
SK1302,148,Oh, Ogami.
SK1302,149,If you'd like, I could broadcast whatever music you want throughout the building.
SK1302,150,I have three records for you, which one would you like?
SK1302,151,Oh, Ogami. Want to change the music playing?
SK1302,152,"Continuation of the Dream"
SK1302,153,"Imperial Theater - Daytime Theme"
SK1302,154,"Summer Theme"
SK1302,155,OK then, I'll go with "Continuation of the Dream."
SK1302,156,"Continuation of the Dream", got it!
SK1302,157,Heehee, kinda feels more lively around here, now.
SK1302,158,OK then, I'll go with "Imperial Theater - Daytime Theme."
SK1302,159,Imperial Theater - Daytime Theme, got it!
SK1302,160,This really makes it feel like an ordinary day in the theater.
SK1302,161,OK then, I'll go with "Summer Theme."
SK1302,162,"Summer Theme", got it!
SK1302,163,A change in mood like this isn't bad every once in a while!
SK1302,164,Well, Ogami? Are you OK with broadcasting this song?
SK1302,165,Sorry, let me pick again.
SK1302,166,Yeah, this will do.
SK1302,167,Yeah, this will do.
SK1302,168,OK, understood! Let me know if you ever want to change it again.
SK1302,169,Sorry, let me pick again.
SK1302,170,That's all right! Which one do you want?
SK1302,171,Sorry, let me pick again.
SK1302,172,Fickle as ever, aren't you? Which one do you want?
SK1302,173,Hey, Tsubomi.
SK1302,174,Ah, Mr. Ogami! Hello!
SK1302,175,If you want to know what's going on on the first floor, just ask me.
SK1302,176,Ask about the Flower Division.
SK1302,177,Ask about other people.
SK1302,178,Go somewhere else.
SK1302,179,You haven't seen the rest of the Flower Division, have you?
SK1302,180,Well, if it's someone you're particularly close with...
SK1302,181,I think if you walk around the first floor, you might be able to see her.
SK1302,182,Do you know where the non-Flower Division people are at?
SK1302,183,If you go to the gift shop, Tsubaki will show you some special photos.
SK1302,184,Kasumi and Yuri are in the office...
SK1302,185,But I've also seen them around the stage and music room.
SK1302,186,All right, I'll get going. See you later, Tsubomi.
SK1302,187,Yes! Thank you very much!
SK1302,188,Are you there, sir? It's Ogami.
SK1302,189,Zzz...<br>Zzz...
SK1302,190,Good grief... Sounds like he's enjoying an afternoon nap.
SK1302,191,I'll leave him be and not wake him up.
SK1302,192,Hey, Ogami. You tried the battle simulator yet?
SK1302,193,I can teach ya a few tricks about fighting, if you want.
SK1302,194,Hey, Ogami.
SK1302,195,Need any tips for the battle simulator?
SK1302,196,Tips on how to fight well.
SK1302,197,Tips on how to get a high score.
SK1302,198,Go somewhere else.
SK1302,199,Please give me some tips on how to fight well.
SK1302,200,The trick to fighting well rests entirely on your shoulders as captain.
SK1302,201,You have to use "Cover" to block enemy attacks targeting your squadmates...
SK1302,202,And you have to skillfully switch around your offense and defense using Captain Commands.
SK1302,203,You alone, Ogami, are able to take advantage of two Captain Commands in a single turn.
SK1302,204,For instance, you can use the "Wind" command to travel from far away...
SK1302,205,Then switch to the "Fire" command to attack immediately afterward.
SK1302,206,As with all things, you gotta be crafty.
SK1302,207,Please give me some tips on how to get a high score.
SK1302,208,Right. More than anything, don't let any of your squadmates get downed.
SK1302,209,If you suffer any casualties, your score will take a huge hit.
SK1302,210,Next, take out all the enemies as fast as you can.
SK1302,211,If you can meet the victory conditions as quickly as possible, your score will go up.
SK1302,212,For now, just keep those two things in mind.
SK1302,213,All right, I'll be going now. Sorry to bother you.
SK1302,214,Yeah. Go get some high scores!
SK1302,215,Looks like the entrance is locked, since it's a holiday today.
SK1302,216,I'll just go somewhere else.
SK1302,217,Oh, Kohran. What are you doing here?
SK1302,218,Ah, Chief? Nothing, I was just wandering around.
SK1302,219,Things have gotten peaceful enough where I can just relax like this.
SK1302,220,I'm sure that'll make Mr. Howard back in Kobe happy.
SK1302,221,Mr. Howard, huh? That brings me back.
SK1302,222,Oh yeah, we went to see him together in Kobe, huh.
SK1302,223,The only reason I've made it this far is because your smiling face is always there for me.
SK1302,224,Ogami... Stay with me, forever..
SK1302,225,...ran...<br>Hey... Kohran.
SK1302,226,...Hm?
SK1302,227,Ch-Chief! Sorry, guess I was spacing out a bit.
SK1302,228,Ahahaha, what's the matter, Kohran?
SK1302,229,Chief...
SK1302,230,...Hm? What, is there something on my face?
SK1302,231,N-Nope, it's nothin'!
SK1302,232,R-Right, well, I gotta get going. Later, Chief!
SK1302,233,Did my smiling creep her out or something?
SK1302,234,...Oh well. I'll just get going.
SK1302,235,Doesn't look like Kohran's here anymore.
SK1302,236,Oh well. I'll go somewhere else.
SK1302,237,Looks like there's no one here.
SK1302,238,I've got plenty of time to kill, so I'll just wander around some more.
SK1302,239,Ah, Ogami!
SK1302,240,Hey, Sakura. What are you up to?
SK1302,241,I was just cleaning up the prop room.
SK1302,242,I see. You really like doing housework, don't you, Sakura?
SK1302,243,You even made me breakfast when I went to visit your family.
SK1302,244,Heehee, that did happen, didn't it?
SK1302,245,We could only stay in Sendai for a short while, but it was so much fun....
SK1302,246,...
SK1302,247,...Sakura?<br>What's the matter?
SK1302,248,Ah!
SK1302,249,Oh... Oh gosh... I'm sorry, Ogami.
SK1302,250,W-Well I have to get going now.
SK1302,251,Look forward to some tasty miso soup, OK?
SK1302,252,...Miso soup? She was just cleaning, why is she talking about miso soup now?
SK1302,253,Doesn't look like Sakura's here anymore.
SK1302,254,Oh well. I'll go somewhere else.
SK1302,255,Nobody here in the kitchen.
SK1302,256,There's still time before we have to eat. I'll head somewhere else.
SK1302,257,Oh, if it isn't Kanna.
SK1302,258,Hey, Boss. Heh, I was feelin' kinda hungry.
SK1302,259,Feels like I can finally relax now that our spring production's wrapped.
SK1302,260,You had two big roles back to back between the Christmas and spring plays.
SK1302,261,The Christmas play, huh?
SK1302,262,Heheh, now I feel kinda nostalgic.
SK1302,263,Back then, I was so conflicted over whether or not I could play the lead role.
SK1302,264,I was so nervous, reading that script the night before I got picked...
SK1302,265,It's all thanks to you, Boss, that I was able to take the stage as the star of the Christmas play.
SK1302,266,Thank you, Boss. It really means a lot to me.
SK1302,267,...Kanna? What's up?
SK1302,268,...H-Huh? Where... am I?
SK1302,269,What do you mean, where? This is the kitchen.
SK1302,270,Ah... Ahaha... Y-Yeah, you're right.
SK1302,271,W-Welp, I gotta go. Seeya, Boss!
SK1302,272,Kanna... What was up with her?
SK1302,273,I thought she came here to get something to eat...
SK1302,274,Doesn't look like Kanna's here.
SK1302,275,Oh well, guess I should go to another room.
SK1302,276,Nobody here in the lobby. It is a holiday, I suppose.
SK1302,277,No use sticking around. I'll go somewhere else.
SK1302,278,Oh, Captain.
SK1302,279,Hey, Maria. Where are you going?
SK1302,280,I'm just taking a stroll around the theater, like you, Captain...
SK1302,281,Reminiscing about the past year all the while.
SK1302,282,I see...
SK1302,283,That reminds me of the time we all went to Atami on vacation.
SK1302,284,Yes, I remember that well.
SK1302,285,We were trapped in that cave together...
SK1302,286,I decided I would stay behind.
SK1302,287,But then you told me you weren't going to leave me.
SK1302,288,...
SK1302,289,...Maria?<br>What's the matter?
SK1302,290,Hm hm...<br>It's nothing.
SK1302,291,Well then, Captain, I'll be going now.
SK1302,292,Let's both enjoy our day off.
SK1302,293,Yeah. See you later, Maria.
SK1302,294,Maria seemed lost in thought about something that whole time.
SK1302,295,Must've been reminiscing like she mentioned before.
SK1302,296,Looks like Maria's gone somewhere else already.
SK1302,297,Oh well, guess I should go to another room.
SK1302,298,Figures nobody'd be here today, since it's a holiday and all.
SK1302,299,Oh well, I'll go somewhere else.
SK1302,300,Oh, Captain...
SK1302,301,Hey, Reni. What are you up to?
SK1302,302,I was reflecting on some things.
SK1302,303,Like when I first went up on stage here, for instance.
SK1302,304,Right, that was for "The Blue Bird", wasn't it?
SK1302,305,...
SK1302,306,Back then... You and all the others... You taught me something.
SK1302,307,To fight for myself... To fight for the ones I love.
SK1302,308,...
SK1302,309,Captain... Thanks.
SK1302,310,Huh?
SK1302,311,Well... I'll be going now.
SK1302,312,...?
SK1302,313,Did I do anything worth being thanked for just now...?
SK1302,314,Doesn't look like Reni's here anymore.
SK1302,315,No use staying here. I'll go somewhere else.
SK1302,316,It's our day off, so there's not a single customer in sight.
SK1302,317,Right, I've got plenty of time still. Where to next?
SK1302,318,Hey Iris, were you out just now?
SK1302,319,Yep, I was sending a letter to my Papa and Mama!
SK1302,320,Hahaha, I see. That reminds me of when we went to go see them.
SK1302,321,Heheh, I remember that too!
SK1302,322,...
SK1302,323,...
SK1302,324,...Iris? Hey, what's wrong?
SK1302,325,H-Huh?
SK1302,326,Oh... S-Sorry, Mon Frère!
SK1302,327,I was just thinking about some stuff...
SK1302,328,Oh? What kind of stuff? C'mon, tell me.
SK1302,329,Heheheh, that's! A! Secret!
SK1302,330,I'm gonna go now, Mon Frère.<br>Bye-bye!
SK1302,331,Hmm, I wonder what she was thinking about.
SK1302,332,Well, no use staying here, at any rate. I'll go somewhere else.
SK1302,333,Iris isn't here anymore.
SK1302,334,Oh well.<br>Guess I'll get going.
SK1302,335,Nobody here in the dressing room, since it's our day off.
SK1302,336,Oh well. I'll go somewhere else.
SK1302,337,Huh? What are you up to, Orihime?
SK1302,338,That voice... Is that you, Ensign?
SK1302,339,I was just stretching my legs on top of the tatami.
SK1302,340,Tatami mats feel great once you get used to them.
SK1302,341,That sounds nice. I think I'll stretch my legs a bit too.
SK1302,342,Still, I remember, back when you first got here...
SK1302,343,You did not have a lot of nice things to say about tatami mats.
SK1302,344,Come on, that's ancient history!<br>You're such a bully, Ensign.
SK1302,345,Hahaha, you've sure changed a lot over the past year, Orihime.
SK1302,346,Now that you mention it...<br>You might be right.
SK1302,347,...Orihime?
SK1302,348,...
SK1302,349,That reminds me, back when Papa and Mama came to visit...
SK1302,350,...hime...<br>Orihime...
SK1302,351,...Hm?
SK1302,352,Ah! Wh-Where am I?
SK1302,353,Seems like the tatami mat felt so good you dozed off for a second.
SK1302,354,I see...<br>So that was... a dream.
SK1302,355,...A dream?<br>What kind of dream were you having?
SK1302,356,I-I'm not telling!
SK1302,357,W-Well, I have places to be, so I have to get going!
SK1302,358,Right...<br>She sure left in a huff.
SK1302,359,I wonder what she was dreaming about...
SK1302,360,Orihime's not here anymore.
SK1302,361,Oh well.<br>Guess I'll head somewhere else.
SK1302,362,Nobody here in the costume room, since it's our day off.
SK1302,363,Oh well. I'll go somewhere else.
SK1302,364,...
SK1302,365,Sumire?
SK1302,366,Ensign?
SK1302,367,Pardon me, Ensign.
SK1302,368,I was just looking at this costume and thinking back to our summer production.
SK1302,369,Our summer production, huh?<br>That was right after we barged into your home.
SK1302,370,Yes...
SK1302,371,...
SK1302,372,Sumire?<br>You've been quiet for a long time. What's wrong?
SK1302,373,...Huh?
SK1302,374,O-Oh my... What's come over me?
SK1302,375,I was simply lost in thought... I do apologize.
SK1302,376,What were you thinking about?
SK1302,377,N-Nothing at all!
SK1302,378,Now I must be going.<br>Good day!
SK1302,379,...?<br>What's up with Sumire?
SK1302,380,Doesn't look like Sumire's here anymore.
SK1302,381,Oh well. I'll go somewhere else.
SK1302,382,Oh, Ogami.
SK1302,383,Hey Sakura, thought I'd come hang out.
SK1302,384,I'm sorry, Ogami. I know you went out of you way to come see me...
SK1302,385,But I'm in the middle of writing a letter to my mother.
SK1302,386,I see. That's OK. I'll come back some other time.
SK1302,387,I'm sorry. Let's practice our swordplay next time.
SK1302,388,Sakura?<br>It's Ogami.
SK1302,389,Sorry, Ogami.<br>I'm in the middle of writing a letter.
SK1302,390,I see... Oh well, then.
SK1302,391,Ah, Ogami, you're here!
SK1302,392,Yeah.<br>I'm not interrupting anything, am I?
SK1302,393,No, not at all.<br>I've been waiting for you, actually.
SK1302,394,I was thinking we could head to the yard to practice our swordplay. Want to come along?
SK1302,395,Oh, Ogami.
SK1302,396,Hey Sakura, thought I'd come hang out.
SK1302,397,Perfect timing. I was just about to go the yard for some sword practice.
SK1302,398,You could come join me, if you'd like?
SK1302,399,Ah, Ogami, perfect timing.
SK1302,400,Care to join me again for some sword practice?
SK1302,401,Join her for sword practice.
SK1302,402,Think back on past practice.
SK1302,403,Maybe next time.
SK1302,404,Yeah, sure.<br>If you don't mind, then I'd love to join you.
SK1302,405,Really?<br>Thank you so much!
SK1302,406,Right then, let's head to the yard right away.
SK1302,407,Nice job, Ogami. You were a great help.
SK1302,408,Join her for practice.
SK1302,409,Think back on past practice.
SK1302,410,Go somewhere else.
SK1302,411,If you don't mind, then I can stick around for some more practice.
SK1302,412,Really? Thank you so much!
SK1302,413,OK then, please stick around!
SK1302,414,(Training with Sakura was rough, but a lot of fun...)
SK1302,415,Ogami? Is there something wrong?
SK1302,416,No, I was just thinking about that time we trained before.
SK1302,417,You really went for it, didn't you, Sakura?
SK1302,418,Oh, not at all. It's just that you and I were in perfect sync.
SK1302,419,All right, I have to get going. Nice job, Sakura.
SK1302,420,Thank you so much!<br>Stop by again sometime!
SK1302,421,(Training with Sakura was rough, but a lot of fun...)
SK1302,422,Ogami? Is there something wrong?
SK1302,423,No, I was just thinking about that time we trained before.
SK1302,424,You really went for it, didn't you, Sakura?
SK1302,425,Oh, not at all. It's just that you and I were in perfect sync.
SK1302,426,I appreciate the offer, but maybe next time. Sorry, Sakura.
SK1302,427,I see... Well, stop by again sometime.
SK1302,428,Oh my, Ensign...
SK1302,429,Hey, Sumire, thought I'd come hang out.
SK1302,430,My apologies, but I have matters to attend to.
SK1302,431,..."Matters"? What would those happen to be?
SK1302,432,Hmhm, I'm afraid I can't say.
SK1302,433,Now then, Ensign, if you'll please excuse me.
SK1302,434,Hmm... Well, if she's busy, then so be it.
SK1302,435,Sumire.
SK1302,436,...
SK1302,437,Doesn't look like she's here. She did say she had matters to attend to. I'll go elsewhere.
SK1302,438,Oh, Ensign, welcome.
SK1302,439,Hey, Sumire, thought I'd come hang out.
SK1302,440,My apologies, I was just about to head to the stage...
SK1302,441,The stage? For dance practice, I take it?
SK1302,442,...!<br>Th-That's not...
SK1302,443,Hey, Sumire, thought I'd come hang out.
SK1302,444,Oh, my apologies, I was just about to head to the stage...
SK1302,445,The stage? For dance practice, I take it?
SK1302,446,...!<br>Th-That's not...
SK1302,447,Hey, Sumire, need help with your dance practice?
SK1302,448,...Well, no use hiding it now that you've found out.
SK1302,449,Help her with dance practice.
SK1302,450,Reminisce about Sumire dancing.
SK1302,451,Go somewhere else.
SK1302,452,If you don't mind, Sumire, I could help you with your practice.
SK1302,453,Nothing gets past you, does it, Ensign?
SK1302,454,Very well, then.<br>Now, Ensign...<br>If you'd be so kind.
SK1302,455,Thank you very much for your assistance, Ensign.
SK1302,456,Join her for practice.
SK1302,457,Think back on past practice.
SK1302,458,Go somewhere else.
SK1302,459,If you want, I could practice with you some more.
SK1302,460,Are you sure? It's your day off, after all.
SK1302,461,Yeah, don't worry about it. Besides, I've gotten pretty good at controlling the lights.
SK1302,462,Ohohohoho... Well then, if you insist.
SK1302,463,(Sumire sure was beautiful dancing in the spotlight...)
SK1302,464,What's the matter, Ensign? You look as though in a trance.
SK1302,465,...N-No, it's nothing.
SK1302,466,Could it be you were daydreaming of my beautiful dancing figure?
SK1302,467,You... Yeah, you nailed it.
SK1302,468,Ohohoho... I've learned a lot about you these past two years, Ensign.
SK1302,469,All right, I'm gonna get going. Nice job, Sumire.
SK1302,470,Remember, these practice sessions are our secret!
SK1302,471,(Sumire sure was pretty dancing in the spotlight...)
SK1302,472,What's the matter, Ensign? You look as though in a trance.
SK1302,473,...N-No, it's nothing.
SK1302,474,... You look like you're busy, so I'm gonna head out.
SK1302,475,Thank you for being so considerate, Ensign...
SK1302,476,Oh, Captain.
SK1302,477,Hey, Maria. Thought I'd come hang out.
SK1302,478,Apologies, sir, but I was in the middle of reading...
SK1302,479,I... I see. Sorry to bother you.
SK1302,480,No, I'm sorry to waste your time after having come here.
SK1302,481,Maybe we can go shopping later when we've got the time.
SK1302,482,It's Ogami.
SK1302,483,Apologies, Captain. I'm still reading.
SK1302,484,I... I see. Oh well.
SK1302,485,Hey, Maria. Thought I'd come hang out.
SK1302,486,Oh, Captain.
SK1302,487,Hm hm... I was actually reading through my diary just now.
SK1302,488,I wrote about the time we went out shopping together in the rain... That really brings back memories.
SK1302,489,Oh yeah, that did happen, didn't it?
SK1302,490,Hey, Maria. Doing some reading?
SK1302,491,Yes, I suppose you could call it that. I was going through my diary.
SK1302,492,Hm hm... I even wrote about the time we went shopping together in the rain.
SK1302,493,Oh yeah, that did happen, didn't it?
SK1302,494,Hey, Maria. Reading through your diary still?
SK1302,495,Yes. I want these good memories to last, no matter how much time has passed.
SK1302,496,Recall the shopping trip.
SK1302,497,Think back on how Maria looked after the rain.
SK1302,498,Go somewhere else.
SK1302,499,That's right, we walked all the way back to the theater with only one umbrella to share between us.
SK1302,500,Yeah, the memories of that time are all coming back to me...
SK1302,501,Captain? What's the matter?
SK1302,502,Oh, sorry. I was just thinking about that time myself.
SK1302,503,Hm hm, I see.
SK1302,504,It was careless of us to bring only one umbrella...
SK1302,505,But because of that, we got to make some nice memories.
SK1302,506,Talk about that shopping trip a little more.
SK1302,507,Recall how Maria looked after the rain.
SK1302,508,Go somewhere else.
SK1302,509,How about we talk about that time we went shopping some more?
SK1302,510,All right, sure. Today's our day off, so you can stay as long as you'd like.
SK1302,511,Hm hm, what a fun memory.
SK1302,512,I'd love to go shopping with you again sometime.
SK1302,513,Sure. We can go whenever you'd like.
SK1302,514,You looked really pretty after we got out of that rain, Maria.
SK1302,515,C-Captain! Please don't bring that up.
SK1302,516,Hahaha, why not? It was another nice memory.
SK1302,517,All right, I'd better get going. See you, Maria.
SK1302,518,Yes, sir. Thank you for taking the time to see me.
SK1302,519,You looked really pretty after we got out of that rain, Maria.
SK1302,520,C-Captain! Please don't bring that up.
SK1302,521,Hahaha, why not? It was another nice memory.
SK1302,522,All right, I'd better get going. See you, Maria.
SK1302,523,Yes, sir. Thank you for taking the time to see me.
SK1302,524,Well if it ain't the Boss!
SK1302,525,Hey, Kanna. Thought I'd come hang out.
SK1302,526,Sorry, Boss. I was just about to head down to the exercise room to practice my karate.
SK1302,527,I see... Sorry to bother you, then.
SK1302,528,Sorry, Boss.
SK1302,529,It's Ogami...
SK1302,530,...
SK1302,531,Doesn't look like she's here. Oh well, guess I'll go somewhere else.
SK1302,532,Hey, Boss! You here to hang out?
SK1302,533,Yeah, it's my day off, so I've got time. What were you up to just now?
SK1302,534,Heh, I was just thinkin' about the past for a change.
SK1302,535,There was that one time you and I had to climb through the attic to fix the roof.
SK1302,536,Man, that was fun. I still remember it from time to time.
SK1302,537,Hey Kanna, thought I'd come hang out. What are you up to?
SK1302,538,Heh, I was just thinkin' about the past for a change.
SK1302,539,There was that one time you and I had to climb through the attic to fix the roof.
SK1302,540,Man, that was fun. I still remember it from time to time.
SK1302,541,Hey, Boss. Back again?
SK1302,542,Yeah, just kinda wandered in here.
SK1302,543,Heh, wanna climb up on the roof again while you're here?
SK1302,544,Think back on repairing the roof.
SK1302,545,Recall how Kanna looked on the rooftop.
SK1302,546,Go somewhere else.
SK1302,547,Now that you mention it, there was that one time we had to run through the attic together...
SK1302,548,You should tag along again the next time I go up to fix the roof!
SK1302,549,Haha, all right, sure.
SK1302,550,Think back once more.
SK1302,551,Recall how Kanna looked on the rooftop.
SK1302,552,Go somewhere else.
SK1302,553,It was pretty grueling, but still fun.
SK1302,554,We made it up on the roof after we got through the attic.
SK1302,555,Nothing beats lying on the roof and looking up at the sky, huh?
SK1302,556,When you've got time, Boss, we should climb up there again.
SK1302,557,All right, I should get going. Later, Kanna.
SK1302,558,Gotcha. Come back and hang sometime!
SK1302,559,We made it up on the roof after we got through the attic.
SK1302,560,Nothing beats lying on the roof and looking up at the sky, huh?
SK1302,561,When you've got time, Boss, we should climb up there again.
SK1302,562,All right, I should get going. Later, Kanna.
SK1302,563,Gotcha. Come back and hang sometime!
SK1302,564,Ah, Mon frère!
SK1302,565,Hey Iris, I'm here to play.
SK1302,566,Sorry, Mon Frère, but I'm studying right now.
SK1302,567,We'll have plenty of time to play when I'm all done!
SK1302,568,R-Right... Sorry for interrupting your studies.
SK1302,569,Well then, keep studying hard, Iris.
SK1302,570,OK! Sorry, Mon Frère!
SK1302,571,(Iris said she was studying...)
SK1302,572,(I shouldn't bother her. Guess I'll go somewhere else.)
SK1302,573,Ah, Mon Frère!<br>You're gonna play with me?!
SK1302,574,Yeah. What are you up to?
SK1302,575,I was just organizing all the pictures you took of me.
SK1302,576,I even found pictures from that time we went to the festival!
SK1302,577,Hey Iris, I'm here to play.
SK1302,578,Ah, Mon Frère! You came at just the right time!
SK1302,579,I was just organizing all the pictures you took of me.
SK1302,580,I even found pictures from that time we went to the festival!
SK1302,581,Hey, Iris. Still organizing those photos?
SK1302,582,Yup! I've got a whole bunch, you know!
SK1302,583,Recall the festival.
SK1302,584,Ask to see the photo.
SK1302,585,Go somewhere else.
SK1302,586,Oh yeah, you brought me along to go see all those stalls.
SK1302,587,Eheheh! It was so much fun, huh, Mon Frère!
SK1302,588,A little exhausting, but yeah.
SK1302,589,I had soooo much fun!
SK1302,590,I hope we can go together again someday!
SK1302,591,Recall the festival.
SK1302,592,Ask to see the photo.
SK1302,593,Go somewhere else.
SK1302,594,Let me think back on the festival one more time...
SK1302,595,Iris, could you show me the picture from the festival?
SK1302,596,OK, sure!<br>Here you go.
SK1302,597,Eheheh...<br>I feel kind of embarrassed.
SK1302,598,You don't have to, this is a great picture of you.
SK1302,599,Really? Thank you, Mon Frère.
SK1302,600,All right, I should get going. See you later, Iris.
SK1302,601,OK! Bye-bye, Mon Frère!
SK1302,602,Iris, could you show me the picture from the festival?
SK1302,603,OK, sure!<br>Here you go.
SK1302,604,Eheheh...<br>I feel kind of embarrassed.
SK1302,605,You don't have to, this is a great picture of you.
SK1302,606,Really? Thank you, Mon Frère.
SK1302,607,All right, I should get going. See you later, Iris.
SK1302,608,OK! Bye-bye, Mon Frère!
SK1302,609,Oh, Chief, I was wondering who that was.
SK1302,610,Hey, Kohran. Thought I'd come hang out.
SK1302,611,You came at just the right time! I'm just about to take my newest invention for a test drive.
SK1302,612,...Wanna be my guinea pig, Chief?
SK1302,613,Eep?!<br>G-Guinea pig?!
SK1302,614,Relax, it's fine! Even if it blows up, you'll just get covered in soot at worst.
SK1302,615,Getting covered in soot is bad enough as it is!
SK1302,616,Actually, I just remembered, there's something urgent I have to do, so... Later, Kohran!
SK1302,617,Ah, Chief! W-Wait a second!
SK1302,618,(Seemed like Kohran was in the middle of inventing something.)
SK1302,619,(She'll make me her guinea pig if I just wander in there... I should go somewhere else.)
SK1302,620,Hey Chief! Here to hang out?
SK1302,621,Yeah, it's my day off and all, plus I just wanted to talk to you.
SK1302,622,Now that the fighting's over, the Koubu are also taking a much-needed break.
SK1302,623,Looks like I'll be spending my time in the garden for a while, then.
SK1302,624,I'll be able to grow some yummy tomatoes for ya by summer, Chief.
SK1302,625,Hey, Kohran. Thought I'd come hang out.
SK1302,626,Great timing, Chief.<br>I've got time to kill, too.
SK1302,627,Now that the fighting's over, the Koubu are also taking a much-needed break.
SK1302,628,Looks like I'll be spending my time in the garden for a while, then.
SK1302,629,I'll be able to grow some yummy tomatoes for ya by summer, Chief.
SK1302,630,Oh, Chief. Back so soon?
SK1302,631,Wanted to talk some more about that time we harvested those tomatoes?
SK1302,632,Think back on the harvest.
SK1302,633,Recall Kohran.
SK1302,634,Go somewhere else.
SK1302,635,Oh yeah, there was that time last summer where we harvested tomatoes while having to fight off those crows.
SK1302,636,It was pretty hectic, but that kind of work's not so bad every now and then.
SK1302,637,We'll have another battle of wits against the crows later this year! They're not gettin' any of my veggies!
SK1302,638,Think back once more.
SK1302,639,Recall Kohran.
SK1302,640,Go somewhere else.
SK1302,641,Let me think back on that one more time...
SK1302,642,I can still remember how much you smiled while we were harvesting those tomatoes...
SK1302,643,Aw, cut it out, Chief. You remember the weirdest things.
SK1302,644,Hahaha, what, it's a nice memory.
SK1302,645,...You're right. Here's to growing more nice tomatoes together, Chief.
SK1302,646,I should get going. Thanks for having me over, Kohran.
SK1302,647,Come back and hang whenever ya like!
SK1302,648,I can still remember how much you smiled while we were harvesting those tomatoes...
SK1302,649,Aw, cut it out, Chief. You remember the weirdest things.
SK1302,650,Hahaha, what, it's a nice memory.
SK1302,651,...You're right. Here's to growing more nice tomatoes together, Chief.
SK1302,652,I should get going. Thanks for having me over, Kohran.
SK1302,653,Come back and hang whenever ya like!
SK1302,654,Oh, Ensign. Did you need something?
SK1302,655,I have the day off, so I thought I'd stop by and chat with you.
SK1302,656,Ensign... I was actually just about to have my siesta.
SK1302,657,Siesta"...? Oh, you're going to take a nap, huh?
SK1302,658,I'm sorry. Stop by some other time, OK?
SK1302,659,Orihime? It's Ogami.
SK1302,660,Zzz...<br>Zzz...
SK1302,661,Sounds like she's already started napping.
SK1302,662,Hi, Orihime.
SK1302,663,Oh, Ensign! Are you here to play?
SK1302,664,I was just about to go down to play the piano. Want to join me?
SK1302,665,Hey, Orihime. Thought I'd come hang out.
SK1302,666,You look like you have a lot of free time on your hands, Ensign, as usual.
SK1302,667,Oh yeah, I was just about to go down to play the piano. Want to join me?
SK1302,668,Oh, Ensign.<br>You're back?
SK1302,669,If you've got time to kill, then how about we go play some piano?
SK1302,670,Go together.
SK1302,671,Think back on Orihime playing piano.
SK1302,672,Go somewhere else.
SK1302,673,If you'll have me, I'd love to.
SK1302,674,OK, let's head down there right away!
SK1302,675,(Oh yeah, there was that time Orihime tried to test my musical aptitude.)
SK1302,676,(That was... Last summer, right?)
SK1302,677,...
SK1302,678,(I can't believe it's already been half a year since then...)
SK1302,679,Ensiiiign? Are you listening to my piano playing?
SK1302,680,Y-Yeah, I'm listening.
SK1302,681,Remember the music test.
SK1302,682,Look at Orihime.
SK1302,683,Go somewhere else.
SK1302,684,(I can still remember it clearly...)
SK1302,685,...
SK1302,686,Ensign, you've been spacing out for a while now. Are you even listening to me?!
SK1302,687,I-I was just caught up in your piano playing, Orihime...
SK1302,688,...Really, now? Well, I guess that's fine.
SK1302,689,...
SK1302,690,...
SK1302,691,(I can still picture how Orihime looked back then...)
SK1302,692,Lala... Lala...<br>Lalala....
SK1302,693,(Orihime didn't listen to me very much back then...)
SK1302,694,(But she looked just as serious playing the piano as she does now...)
SK1302,695,I hate to leave in the middle of your performance, but I have to get going.
SK1302,696,If you're leaving then I'll be leaving too.
SK1302,697,Let's come back here again sometime!
SK1302,698,Yeah, I'm looking forward to it.
SK1302,699,(Even looking at her just like this, I can picture her playing the piano...)
SK1302,700,...Ensign? You've been dead silent ever since you got here.
SK1302,701,...Oh, sorry, my bad. Just spaced out a bit.
SK1302,702,Feeling listless now that the battle's over, is that it?
SK1302,703,Listening to my piano playing might make for a nice change of pace.
SK1302,704,I'll be going now. Sorry to disturb you, Orihime.
SK1302,705,Come on! You might as well come listen to me play piano while you're here!
SK1302,706,S-Sorry... I'm busy with other stuff...
SK1302,707,...Well, next time, make the time to listen to me play, got it?!
SK1302,708,Captain...
SK1302,709,Hey Reni. Thought I'd come hang out.
SK1302,710,...Sorry. I'm about to go take a bath.
SK1302,711,O-Oh...<br>Can't exactly join you for that one, can I?
SK1302,712,All right, take it easy, then.<br>Later, Reni.
SK1302,713,...OK.<br>Sorry, Captain.
SK1302,714,It's Ogami...
SK1302,715,...
SK1302,716,Looks like she's not back yet. I'll go somewhere else.
SK1302,717,Captain...
SK1302,718,Hey, Reni.<br>Going somewhere?
SK1302,719,Yeah. I was just about to head to the pool for my swimming practice.
SK1302,720,...Will you be coming too?
SK1302,721,Captain...
SK1302,722,Hey, Reni.<br>Going somewhere?
SK1302,723,Yeah. I was just about to head to the pool for my swimming practice.
SK1302,724,...Will you be coming too?
SK1302,725,Hey, Reni. Going to the pool again?
SK1302,726,Yeah.<br>Will you be coming too, Captain?
SK1302,727,Go swimming.
SK1302,728,Recall Reni's bathing suit.
SK1302,729,Go somewhere else.
SK1302,730,OK, today's my day off, so I'm ready to swim my heart out!
SK1302,731,...OK.<br>Let's go, Captain.
SK1302,732,Phew... That was refreshing.
SK1302,733,Are you not going to swim more, Captain?
SK1302,734,Swim some more.
SK1302,735,Look at Reni.
SK1302,736,Go somewhere else.
SK1302,737,I'm still going! I'm ready to swim all day!
SK1302,738,Good luck, Captain.
SK1302,739,(Reni in her bathing suit...)
SK1302,740,Captain... What are you staring at?
SK1302,741,Uh... N-Nothing, nothing at all, Reni.
SK1302,742,All right, I'm gonna go now. Nice job, Reni.
SK1302,743,OK. See you later, Captain.
SK1302,744,(Reni sure was cute in that swimsuit...)
SK1302,745,...What's the matter, Captain?
SK1302,746,Uh... S-Sorry, I just remembered how you looked in that bathing suit.
SK1302,747,Ah... I-I see.
SK1302,748,All right, I'm gonna go now. Nice job, Reni.
SK1302,749,OK. See you later, Captain.
SK1302,750,Oh, Ogami.
SK1302,751,Hey, Tsubaki. What are you doing in a place like this?
SK1302,752,I figured since we're on break today, you and I could play a game...
SK1302,753,So I've prepared a quiz, just for you, Ogami!
SK1302,754,Wanna see if you can answer ten questions right in a row?
SK1302,755,Oh, Ogami! You're back!
SK1302,756,Would you like to give my quiz a try?
SK1302,757,All right, let's do it!
SK1302,758,...Maybe next time.
SK1302,759,Sounds like fun.<br>All right, let's do it!
SK1302,760,That's the spirit! OK, Ogami, here goes!
SK1302,761,I appreciate it, but maybe next time.
SK1302,762,Huh? You're leaving? Boriiing.
SK1302,763,You've got to play with me some other time, then, OK?
SK1302,764,Well, Ogami? Are you giving up, or do you want to try again?
SK1302,765,I'll keep going!
SK1302,766,...I'll come back later.
SK1302,767,I'll keep going!<br>Hit me with the questions, Tsubaki!
SK1302,768,OK! Well then, here we go!
SK1302,769,...I give up.<br>I'll come back later.
SK1302,770,...I see. Come back and try again when you feel like it.
SK1302,771,Wow! You got them all right!
SK1302,772,Hahaha, somehow.
SK1302,773,OK then, Ogami, please go to the attic next.
SK1302,774,...The attic?<br>What's up there?
SK1302,775,Heheh, that's a secret! All right, come back and play again sometime!
SK1302,776,Wow! You got them all right!
SK1302,777,These questions are probably too easy for you, huh?
SK1302,778,Still, they're a lot of fun.
SK1302,779,Heh, thank you!
SK1302,780,Come back and play again sometime, Ogami!
SK1302,781,Ah, Ogami! Hm hm, I've been waiting for you.
SK1302,782,Hey, Yuri. Need me for something?
SK1302,783,This is your first day off in a while, right? I thought we could play a game together...
SK1302,784,So I've prepared a 10-question battle quiz, just for you, Ogami!
SK1302,785,Ready to put your pride as the Flower Division's captain on the line?
SK1302,786,Ah, Ogami! You came back!
SK1302,787,Want to give my battle quiz a shot?
SK1302,788,All right, let's do it!
SK1302,789,...Maybe next time.
SK1302,790,Sounds like fun.<br>All right, let's do it!
SK1302,791,Hm hm, got it. OK, then... Here we go!
SK1302,792,I appreciate it, but maybe next time.
SK1302,793,Jeez, Ogami! Now I feel all awkward having gone through the effort to prepare this quiz.
SK1302,794,Next time you come here, you're gonna join me, OK?
SK1302,795,Well, Ogami? Are you giving up, or do you want to try again?
SK1302,796,I'll keep going!
SK1302,797,...I'll come back later.
SK1302,798,I can keep going!<br>Keep the questions coming, Yuri!
SK1302,799,You've got guts as always, Ogami! OK, here they come!
SK1302,800,...I give up.<br>I'll come back later.
SK1302,801,Huhhh? Quitting already?
SK1302,802,Next time you come here, I want you to give it a serious shot, OK?
SK1302,803,You did it, Ogami! You answered every question correctly!
SK1302,804,Hahaha, thanks.
SK1302,805,Of course, these are only beginner-level questions, Ogami.
SK1302,806,If you want to give advanced-level questions a try, head up to the terrace.
SK1302,807,So there's advanced-level questions too, huh? OK, I'll give it a shot!
SK1302,808,Good luck! I'm rooting for you!
SK1302,809,That's the Ogami I know! You got them all right!
SK1302,810,This level of quiz is too easy for you at this point, huh?
SK1302,811,Still, they're a lot of fun.
SK1302,812,Really? Thank you!
SK1302,813,Come back and play again sometime, Ogami!
SK1302,814,It's feeling more and more like spring lately with the sun out like this...
SK1302,815,Today's looking like it'll be a great holiday with great weather.
SK1302,816,Oh... Kasumi?
SK1302,817,It seems as though you've cleared Yuri's beginner-level battle quiz.
SK1302,818,I've prepared an even harder combat quiz for you.
SK1302,819,Would you like to see if you can answer ten of my questions correctly in a row?
SK1302,820,Oh, Ogami, you're back.
SK1302,821,Would you like to try the advance-level battle quiz?
SK1302,822,All right, let's do it!
SK1302,823,...Maybe next time.
SK1302,824,Sounds like fun.<br>All right, let's do it!
SK1302,825,OK, understood. I've got some hard questions ready for you, so get ready!
SK1302,826,Right, then... Let's begin.
SK1302,827,I appreciate it, but maybe next time.
SK1302,828,I see. Understood.
SK1302,829,Don't hesitate to stop by whenever you feel like it.
SK1302,830,Giving up already, Ogami? Or would you like to try again?
SK1302,831,I'll keep going!
SK1302,832,...I'll come back later.
SK1302,833,I'll keep going! Keep the questions coming, Kasumi!
SK1302,834,OK, understood. Right, then, without further ado, here they come.
SK1302,835,...I give up.<br>I'll come back later.
SK1302,836,Hm hm, I won this round.
SK1302,837,Come back to challenge me again whenever you like.
SK1302,838,Amazing, Ogami! You got them all right.
SK1302,839,Phew... Looks like I managed to defend my honor as Flower Division Captain.
SK1302,840,Now then, Ogami, please make your way to Kaede's room.
SK1302,841,Kaede's room? Is there something else after this?
SK1302,842,Hm hm, you'll just have to go and find out!
SK1302,843,Splendid as always, Ogami. You got them all right.
SK1302,844,Thanks, Kasumi. I had a lot of fun, thanks to you.
SK1302,845,No, thank YOU for coming here to play.
SK1302,846,Come back whenever you feel like it, OK?
SK1302,847,Nobody's here...
SK1302,848,No use sticking around. I'll go somewhere else.
SK1302,849,Huh? Nobody's here.
SK1302,850,Tsubaki told me to come here, though... That's odd.
SK1302,851,Yo, Ogami!<br>I've been waiting for you!
SK1302,852,Th-That voice...<br>Kayama?!
SK1302,853,Haha, indeed! Alley OOP!
SK1302,854,Seeing you here must mean you've passed Tsubaki's quiz!
SK1302,855,However, Ogami, Tsubaki's quiz was merely beginner-level questions.
SK1302,856,Think you can handle these stumpers prepared for you by the Moon Division recon unit?
SK1302,857,Yo, Ogami. Back again, I see?
SK1302,858,Ahh, what a joy it is to spend a holiday together with you like this...
SK1302,859,Right then, Ogami.<br>Are you ready to take on my advance-level 10 question quiz?
SK1302,860,Of course I am!
SK1302,861,...Maybe next time.
SK1302,862,Of course I am!
SK1302,863,Good.<br>That right there is why you're the Flower Division Captain.
SK1302,864,Well then, Ogami...<br>Here I come!
SK1302,865,I appreciate it, but maybe next time.
SK1302,866,C-Come on, now, Ogami!<br>You're leaving without answering a single question?!
SK1302,867,Yeah, not really in the mood.<br>I'll do it some other time.
SK1302,868,I-I see...<br>And here I was, raring to go...
SK1302,869,I'll be waiting for you here, Ogami. Come back whenever you please!
SK1302,870,Giving up already? Or would you like to try again?
SK1302,871,I'm just getting started!
SK1302,872,...I'll come back later.
SK1302,873,I'm just getting started!<br>Bring it on, Kayama!
SK1302,874,Well said, Ogami!<br>All right then, without further ado, here goes!
SK1302,875,...I give up.<br>I'll come back later.
SK1302,876,Not knowing is a temporary shame; not learning, an eternal one."
SK1302,877,Even if you can't answer ten questions in a row correctly right now, I know you can eventually.
SK1302,878,Come back and try again at any time, Ogami. I'll be waiting for you.
SK1302,879,Well done, Ogami! You passed the advanced-level quiz with flying colors!
SK1302,880,All right, I did it!
SK1302,881,You've done well to make it this far, Ogami, so I have a present for you.
SK1302,882,Go to the salon. You'll find a fun way to pass the time waiting for you there.
SK1302,883,A fun way to pass the time?
SK1302,884,Heh, you'll find out once you get there! Well then, Ogami, till we meet again!
SK1302,885,Just as I'd expect from you, Ogami. Nothing more needs to be said.
SK1302,886,Well, if you ever feel like challenging my quiz again, come back anytime.
SK1302,887,Sure. Thanks, Kayama.
SK1302,888,Come, now, no need to thank me. A diversion like this on a day off isn't so bad.
SK1302,889,Well then, Ogami, till we meet again!
SK1302,890,Nobody here in the salon.
SK1302,891,Thought everyone would be here, since we have the day off, but I guess not.
SK1302,892,Wha-? What are you all doing here?
SK1302,893,Ah, Ogami.<br>Will you be joining us for cards?
SK1302,894,Cards?
SK1302,895,You came 'round to all our rooms earlier and called for us, right?
SK1302,896,But when we opened our doors, there was nobody there! Are you a ninja or something, Ensign?
SK1302,897,(I get it...<br>This must be Kayama's doing.)
SK1302,898,OK, since everyone's here already, let's play some cards.
SK1302,899,Yaaaay! I'll go get some sweets from my room!
SK1302,900,In that case, I'll brew us a delicious pot of tea.
SK1302,901,It's not every day we have the time to play together like this.
SK1302,902,Just know that I won't lose.
SK1302,903,Awright! Let's get started already!
SK1302,904,Nice job, Ogami.
SK1302,905,If you ever want to play cards again, just come to the salon.
SK1302,906,Hey guys. So this is where you've been.
SK1302,907,We've been waiting for you, Ogami. Let's play cards together.
SK1302,908,We've been waiting for you, Ensign. How about a game of cards with everyone?
SK1302,909,Captain, seeing as we're on holiday, how about we all play cards together for a change?
SK1302,910,We've been waitin' for ya, Boss! Since we're all here now, how's about a game of cards?
SK1302,911,We've been waiting for you, Mon Frère! C'mon, let's play cards already!
SK1302,912,We've been waiting for ya, Chief! C'mon, let's hop to it and play some cards!
SK1302,913,Ensign, we've been waiting! Now, let's all play some cards together!
SK1302,914,Apparently we're just about to play some cards. Will you join us, Captain?
SK1302,915,All right, let's do it!
SK1302,916,Some other time...
SK1302,917,OK! Go easy on me, will you?
SK1302,918,Observe my brilliant card-playing skills!
SK1302,919,Hm hm... Just so you know, I won't go down easily.
SK1302,920,Heheh, that's what I'm talkin' 'bout! OK, but just lettin' ya know, I'm gonna win this thing!
SK1302,921,Eheheh! I'm not gonna lose!
SK1302,922,All right! Just so you know, I'm not gonna go easy on you!
SK1302,923,Europe is the home of card games. I'll show you my true skill!
SK1302,924,Even in play, there is strategy. Know that I won't lose.
SK1302,925,Nice job, Ogami.
SK1302,926,If you ever want to play cards again, just come to the salon.
SK1302,927,I appreciate it, but maybe some other time...
SK1302,928,Huh?! You're not gonna play with us, Mon Frère?! Boooriiiing!
SK1302,929,Iris, I'm sure Ogami's busy with a lot of things right now.
SK1302,930,Well then, Ogami, if you ever feel like playing cards, just come to the salon.
SK1302,931,Kaede? It's Ogami...
SK1302,932,...
SK1302,933,Looks like she's not in.
SK1302,934,Oh, Ogami, is that you?
SK1302,935,You must've beaten Kasumi's quiz if you've come here.
SK1302,936,Y-Yes.
SK1302,937,Very well. Well then, follow me, Ogami.
SK1302,938,What on earth did she bring me all the way to the Command Room for?
SK1302,939,Sorry to keep you waiting, Ogami.
SK1302,940,Kaede?! What on earth...
SK1302,941,Hm hm, sorry to surprise you like this.
SK1302,942,The truth is, we've added a battle simulator to the Command Room. 
SK1302,943,Now you'll be able to practice all kinds of battle scenarios.
SK1302,944,Wow... Th-That's amazing.
SK1302,945,It can even keep score.<br>Truly an amazing machine.<br>Well, will you give it a shot?
SK1302,946,Try it out.
SK1302,947,Maybe next time.
SK1302,948,OK, I'll try it out!
SK1302,949,Good answer, Ogami. I thought you'd say that.
SK1302,950,Well then, take all the time you want, and enjoy.
SK1302,951,I appreciate the offer, but maybe some other time.
SK1302,952,Oh, I see... After all the trouble we went through to set it up, too. What a shame.
SK1302,953,Well, if you ever feel like using it, come to my room.
SK1302,954,OK, understood. Thank you very much.
SK1302,955,Oh, Ogami. Would you like to use the battle simulator?
SK1302,956,Use it.
SK1302,957,Maybe next time.
SK1302,958,Yes, ma'am! I'd like to use it.
SK1302,959,Understood. Right, then, come with me to the command room.
SK1302,960,I appreciate the offer, but maybe some other time.
SK1302,961,Oh... Was I mistaken?
SK1302,962,...Very well, then. If you ever do feel like using it...
SK1302,963,Stop by my room at any time.
SK1302,964,Hey, Tsubomi.
SK1302,965,Ah, Mr. Ogami! Hello!
SK1302,966,If there's anything you'd like to know about the second floor, just ask!
SK1302,967,Ask about the Flower Division.
SK1302,968,Ask about other people.
SK1302,969,Go somewhere else.
SK1302,970,You haven't seen the rest of the Flower Division, have you?
SK1302,971,Everyone ought to be in their rooms right now.
SK1302,972,Since you have the day off today, you could go play with them...
SK1302,973,And simply reminiscing with them might be fun, too.
SK1302,974,What's everyone else doing?
SK1302,975,Right, they said they were getting quizzes ready for you.
SK1302,976,If you can beat all the quizzes, then the Flower Division...
SK1302,977,Ah, whoops! I'm supposed to keep that a secret from you!
SK1302,978,I'm sorry, Mr. Ogami. I can't tell you anything more, since it's a secret and all.
SK1302,979,N-Now I'm getting a little concerned... C'mon, tell me, Tsubomi.
SK1302,980,Smile, smile!
SK1302,981,Hey, Tsubomi.<br>About earlier...
SK1302,982,Smile, smile!
SK1302,983,Sheesh...<br>Doesn't look like I'll be getting anything out of her.
SK1302,984,Ah, Ogami!<br>You solved everyone's quizzes!
SK1302,985,Congratulations!
SK1302,986,Thank you.<br>It made for a fun holiday.
SK1302,987,All right, I'll get going. See you later, Tsubomi.
SK1302,988,Thanks! Please come again!
SK1302,989,Well, if it isn't Ichiro! Did you come to see lil' ol' me?
SK1302,990,Enough, Yokihiko! I told you not to cause a scene now that we're above ground!
SK1302,991,H-He's right, Yokihiko... You're embarrassing us...
SK1302,992,By the way, Ensign Ogami. It's your first day off in a long while, right?
SK1302,993,I'm sure you have a lot of games to play with the rest of the Flower Division today...
SK1302,994,But we of the Rose Division, the secret unit of love and beauty, have acquired some worthwhile intel.
SK1302,995,Oh my, Ichiro, it looks like you don't have any memories of playing with the others.
SK1302,996,That's unfortunate... That means there's nothing we can do to help you, then...
SK1302,997,If the opportunity ever arises again, try playing with the other members of the Flower Division, OK?
SK1302,998,Right, understood.
SK1302,999,Ask whoever you want to tell you some info!
SK1302,1000,Oh, Ensign Ogami. Have you come to hear our intel?
SK1302,1001,Ask Kotone.
SK1302,1002,Ask Yokihiko.
SK1302,1003,Ask Kikunojo.
SK1302,1004,All right, then...<br>Kotone, if you'd be so kind.
SK1302,1005,Hm hm, a man of taste, I see. I'll tell you my top secret info.
SK1302,1006,...Or rather, I would, but none of my intel would be of any use to you right now.
SK1302,1007,We all need to take detours in life. You have to create more memories.
SK1302,1008,O-OK...
SK1302,1009,First, I'll tell you some tips on sword training with Sakura.
SK1302,1010,When two bundles fly out at the same time, that's your chance for a simultaneous strike.
SK1302,1011,Cutting them both at the same is impressive, but the risk of missing them both is also quite high.
SK1302,1012,If you want to consistently seize victory, your best bet is to cut every bundle that flies out.
SK1302,1013,If three come out and you strike all three simultaneously, you'll get a "Lightning Cut" point bonus.
SK1302,1014,That's the key to Sakura's sword training.
SK1302,1015,If you're helping Sumire practice her dancing...
SK1302,1016,Fundamentally, all you have to do is keep Sumire lit with the spotlight kept small.
SK1302,1017,However, when presented with a "Light-up Chance", you should shine the big spotlight on her.
SK1302,1018,Sumire's mood will gradually worsen if you don't keep the spotlight on her...
SK1302,1019,So do your best to direct the spotlight while also managing her mood.
SK1302,1020,Right... That should do it for Sumire's practice.
SK1302,1021,Now, for going out shopping with Maria...
SK1302,1022,At any rate, you'll want to stay out of the water, which means changing the direction of your umbrella often.
SK1302,1023,When you see "!", that means a tailwind's coming up, so try to catch it whenever you can.
SK1302,1024,Remembering when the tailwinds appear is one of several potential strategies.
SK1302,1025,Do your best to not let Maria get soaked.
SK1302,1026,That's all for Maria's shopping trip.
SK1302,1027,All right, then...<br>Yokihiko, if you'd be so kind.
SK1302,1028,You've got it! I'll tell you my special tips!
SK1302,1029,...Oh dear! Seems like my info's useless to you!
SK1302,1030,Look, Ichiro, I understand you wanting to beeline things...
SK1302,1031,But you have to look after the other members of the Flower Division more, OK?
SK1302,1032,O-OK...
SK1302,1033,OK, first, here's some tips for when you go to the attic with Kanna.
SK1302,1034,Kanna can run super fast, sure, but she can't do it alone. She needs you, Ichiro, since you can jump real high.
SK1302,1035,If you ever think an area's too much for you, you can switch places right away!
SK1302,1036,You can even swap out in the middle of a jump or while you're falling. Skillful swapping will take you far!
SK1302,1037,Also, it's probably a good idea to pick up any screws you see, even if it means taking a little detour!
SK1302,1038,That should do it whenever you're with Kanna.
SK1302,1039,Here's some tips for when you're bringing Iris around to the festival stalls.
SK1302,1040,Make careful use of walking and running to slip through the gaps between people.
SK1302,1041,When the parade passes through, make sure Iris sees it toot-sweet!
SK1302,1042,That's right, as time passes, you'll see people with all kinds of movement patterns come out.
SK1302,1043,Just keep your eyes peeled and keep Iris entertained, okeydokey?
SK1302,1044,I think that's about it for visiting the stalls with Iris.
SK1302,1045,Let's see now, tips for harvesting tomatoes with Kohran...
SK1302,1046,Whenever you take out a crow with a smokebomb, it'll envelop any neighboring crows one by one.
SK1302,1047,If they're flying in formation, hit the lead crow and the rest will get enveloped automatically!
SK1302,1048,The crows have all kinds of movement patterns, so be careful, OK?
SK1302,1049,If you can save all the tomatoes or get rid of all the crows, you'll get a whole bunch of points!
SK1302,1050,I think that should do it for the tomato harvesting.
SK1302,1051,All right, then...<br>Kikunojo, if you'd be so kind.
SK1302,1052,O-OK! Understood.
SK1302,1053,Oh, oh my... I don't think any of my information will be of any use to you just yet...
SK1302,1054,I'm sorry I can't be of any help...
SK1302,1055,U-Um, right... How about when you're listening to Orihime playing the piano...?
SK1302,1056,When you have the improper notes in front of you, you need to think carefully whether to move them up or down.
SK1302,1057,Even when they're lined up vertically, just calm down and line them up horizontally. That'll make things easier.
SK1302,1058,Also, the "#" and "♭" won't reach all the way to the end, so do be careful about that.
SK1302,1059,The key is to count out how many notes of the same color are coming, then move them only as much as is necessary.
SK1302,1060,That's all I know about Orihime's piano playing.
SK1302,1061,Here's some advice for when you're joining Reni for her aquatic training...
SK1302,1062,The mines in the pool will increase in number the more targets you pick up.
SK1302,1063,If all you do is aim for the easy targets, you won't get high marks from Reni, either...
SK1302,1064,Going for the fast-moving targets will get you higher ratings from her, so do your best...
SK1302,1065,Also, when you're surrounded by mines, you might actually find it easier to escape if you stay still for a bit...
SK1302,1066,That's all the information I have about Reni's aquatic training.
SK1302,1067,Ask for more info.
SK1302,1068,Go somewhere else.
SK1302,1069,Um... Do you have any other information to share with me?
SK1302,1070,Yes, of course. Who would you like to hear about?
SK1302,1071,Thank you very much.<br>I have to get going now.
SK1302,1072,Come by whenever you'd like to hear any more intel.
SK1302,1073,Phew...<br>Nothing's more relaxing than being in your own room...
SK1302,1074,Go somewhere else.
SK1302,1075,Write in journal and sleep.
SK1302,1076,Now that I've taken a quick break, I'll get going.
SK1302,1077,Might as well roam the theater some more while I have the day off.
SK1302,1078,I think it's time to write in my journal and get some sleep.
SK1302,1079,Phew... Today was a lot of fun.
SK1302,1080,I wonder... what I'll do... tomorrow...
SK1302,1081,The uniform I wear at the theater. Good for both summer and winter.
SK1302,1082,The lighter I borrowed from the inn that broke when I jumped in the ocean. Forgot to give it back.
SK1302,1083,A flower crown made by Iris. Given to me to match Reni's.

SK1303,636,Wrong answer. You still have a long way to go, Ogami.
SK1303,637,Wrong answer, Ogami.
SK1303,638,Looks like ordinary method doesn't work, does it, Ogami?
SK1303,639,Too bad for you. It was a bit difficult part.
SK1303,640,Time's out! Too bad for you.
SK1303,641,You shouldn't think too much, just answer it right away.

SK1303,659,Oh, Ogami. Good morning.
SK1303,660,Good morning. Did you sleep well last night?
SK1303,661,Good morning. I slept like a log, thankfully.
SK1303,662,Breakfast is almost ready, so wait just a little longer.
SK1303,663,Thanks. I'll go get changed, then.
SK1303,664,I'll wake him up!
SK1303,665,Zzz... Zzz...
SK1303,666,Wake up, Ogami, it's morning.
SK1303,667,Ah, good morning, Sakura.
SK1303,668,Good morning. Did you sleep well?
SK1303,669,Yeah, I slept soundly, thankfully.
SK1303,670,Really? Hmhm, glad to hear it.
SK1303,671,We finished making breakfast, so get changed and come to the living room, OK?
SK1303,672,Just 5 more minutes...
SK1303,673,Oh, Ogami, you're hopeless.
SK1303,674,We finished making breakfast, so get changed and come to the living room, OK?
SK1303,675,Hurry up before it gets cold!
SK1303,676,...
SK1303,677,Heehee, Ogami's fast asleep...
SK1303,678,...
SK1303,679,Wake up, dear... It's morning...
SK1303,680,Huh?! S-Sakura...
SK1303,681,Eek! O-Ogami... Were you awake this whole time?!
SK1303,682,Oh, jeez... Hurry and get up already! It's time for breakfast!
SK1303,683,OK, let's eat!
SK1303,684,There's plenty to go around, so eat as much as you'd like!
SK1303,685,Sakura made this breakfast almost entirely by herself.
SK1303,686,Hmhm, I tried to make it just like Mother's!
SK1303,687,*chew* *chew*
SK1303,688,...
SK1303,689,Well, Ogami...? How does it taste?
SK1303,690,It's great! This is delicious, Sakura!
SK1303,691,Really? Thank you so much!
SK1303,692,You've gotten quite good at seasoning, haven't you, Sakura?
SK1303,693,Thanks! I practiced while at the theater so that I can recreate your recipes, Mother.
SK1303,694,Though I do think the miso soup could stand to be a bit lighter.
SK1303,695,Huh, really? OK, you'll have to teach me how afterward!
SK1303,696,Um... It's OK.
SK1303,697,I-Is that right...?
SK1303,698,...
SK1303,699,I think the miso soup should've been a bit lighter.
SK1303,700,I'll teach you the trick to making it later.
SK1303,701,Your father was used to be finicky when it comes to miso soup.
SK1303,702,Wow... You absolutely have to tell me!
SK1303,703,I want to cook just like you... The way Father liked it!
SK1303,704,Hmm... Is it good or is it not...
SK1303,705,Come on, Ogami, which one is it?
SK1303,706,I think the miso soup should've been a bit lighter.
SK1303,707,I'll teach you the trick to making it later.
SK1303,708,Your father was used to be finicky when it comes to miso soup.
SK1303,709,Wow... You absolutely have to tell me!
SK1303,710,I want to cook just like you... The way Father liked it!
SK1303,711,Back then, when I was about to be engaged,
SK1303,712,I called you at the night before the marriage meeting, Ensign.
SK1303,713,Sumire, it's you. Why are you calling so late at night?
SK1303,714,Ensign...
SK1303,715,Between myself and the Imperial Assault Troupe, which is more important to you?
SK1303,716,Wh-What in the world? This came out of nowhere.
SK1303,717,Please, answer me, Ensign.
SK1303,718,Sumire.
SK1303,719,I mean... Both are important to me. But if I had to, I'd choose you, Sumire.
SK1303,720,...
SK1303,721,Ensign...
SK1303,722,I mean... Both are important to me. But if I had to, I'd choose the Imperial Assault Troupe.
SK1303,723,...
SK1303,724,Yes, of course. You are the Flower Division's captain, after all.
SK1303,725,...
SK1303,726,...
SK1303,727,Sumire, you're important to me... and the Troupe is important to me, too.
SK1303,728,I really don't think I could ever choose between the two.
SK1303,729,Ensign...
SK1303,730,...
SK1303,731,Ah, E-Ensign...
SK1303,732,What is it? Is something wrong?
SK1303,733,...No, nothing at all.
SK1303,734,Well then, do pardon me.
SK1303,735,Hey, Sumire!
SK1303,736,...
SK1303,737,Ensign... Farewell.
SK1303,738,...
SK1303,739,Ensign...
SK1303,742,I... I...
SK1303,743,Wait just a damn minute!
SK1303,744,...!! That voice, it couldn't be?!
SK1303,745,Who are you people?
SK1303,746,I am Captain Ichiro Ogami of the Imperial Assault Troupe, Flower Division!
SK1303,747,And I'm Kanna Kirishima, also from the Flower Division!
SK1303,748,Ensign... and Kanna...
SK1303,749,Sumire.
SK1303,750,Sumire...
SK1303,751,Hoh, so you are Ogami, then. All this fuss, I presume you must know who I am, then?
SK1303,752,Surely you have not come here in order to embarrass me...
SK1303,753,...Tadayoshi Kanzaki, who has financed the troupe's activities for so many years?
SK1303,754,No. And the troupe is eternally grateful for the support you've given us.
SK1303,755,But this is a completely separate matter!
SK1303,756,I must object to Sumire being forced into a marriage she doesn't want!
SK1303,757,That's right, gramps! If you think things're gonna go just how you wanted, you're in for a rude awakening!
SK1303,758,Fu... Fwahahaha! Such bravado! I suppose I should expect as much, since you've come all this way.
SK1303,759,But Ogami, what would you say to this?
SK1303,760,You are aware that the troupe's financiers are pulling back their funding, are you not?
SK1303,761,...Yes.
SK1303,762,If you agree to leave peaceably right now, I will see to it that your funding is restored.
SK1303,763,However, if you take Sumire with you, you understand what will happen, yes?
SK1303,764,Grandfather!
SK1303,765,That's low, old man!
SK1303,766,Be silent, women!
SK1303,767,...
SK1303,768,...
SK1303,769,Now then, what will you do, Ogami?
SK1303,770,I understand.
SK1303,771,We're taking Sumire back with us.
SK1303,772,Ensign!
SK1303,773,I... can't make this decision myself. There's too much riding on it.
SK1303,774,B-Boss, what the hell're you saying?!
SK1303,775,...
SK1303,776,You said it yourself, didn't you, Boss?! No matter how tough things might be, we gotta do this with our own strength!
SK1303,777,Sumire's an important part of the Flower Division!
SK1303,778,...Yes. You're absolutely right, Kanna.
SK1303,779,We're taking Sumire back with us!
SK1303,780,Right...
SK1303,785,There's nothing to be afraid of. Just hold my hand and I'll get us both out of here.
SK1303,786,But sir...
SK1303,787,It's all right, Maria. I'll never let you go.
SK1303,788,Please... You have to believe me.
SK1303,789,Captain...
SK1303,790,Don't be stupid, Maria! There's no way I'm leaving you behind in a place like this!
SK1303,791,Let's get out of here! I'm not leaving without you!
SK1303,792,Captain...
SK1303,793,Maria... You'll come with me, won't you?
SK1303,794,...All right. I'll go with you, sir.
SK1303,795,...
SK1303,796,...
SK1303,797,Captain... will you... protect me?
SK1303,798,Maria...
SK1303,799,Of course I will. I'd be unfit to be captain if I couldn't.
SK1303,800,...Yes.
SK1303,801,Now, Maria, take my hand.
SK1303,802,I promise I won't let go.
SK1303,803,Please... Believe me.
SK1303,804,...Yes.
SK1303,805,All right then, here we go!
SK1303,806,...
SK1303,807,...
SK1303,808,Urk...
SK1303,809,...

SK1303,812,...!!
SK1303,815,Maria, are you all right?
SK1303,816,...!
SK1303,817,I never let your hand go, just as I promised.
SK1303,818,Captain...
SK1303,819,Maria, a-are you awake?
SK1303,820,C-Captain...?
SK1303,821,You look... disappointed, somehow.
SK1303,822,O-Of course not! I'm so glad you're OK.
SK1303,823,Captain...
SK1303,824,...
SK1303,825,...Ah!
SK1303,826,Maria, are you all right?
SK1303,827,C-Captain... did you... save me?
SK1303,828,It's all right now, Maria! You did great.
SK1303,829,Captain...
SK1303,830,Maria, are you all right?
SK1303,831,C-Captain... did you... save me?
SK1303,832,Yeah. You're safe now.
SK1303,833,Captain...
SK1303,834,...
SK1303,835,Hm? Is that you, Kanna?
SK1303,836,Oh, Boss?
SK1303,837,I was just readin' the lines for the Holy Mother... This is tough.
SK1303,838,I've played almost nothing but masculine roles like King Lear or Son Goku up till now.
SK1303,839,Do you really think I have what it takes to play a feminine role like this?
SK1303,840,Of course you do! You'd be great, Kanna.
SK1303,841,Huh? R-really?
SK1303,842,Yeah, really. Don't think about it so hard.
SK1303,843,Just throw yourself into it like you always do, Kanna.
SK1303,844,Captain...
SK1303,845,Thanks, Boss. I'm feelin' a bit more confident now.
SK1303,846,It's true, there's some performances only I can do in the Flower Division.
SK1303,847,I just gotta do things my own way. Maybe a boyish heroine wouldn't be so bad.
SK1303,848,Heheh, now I'm lookin' forward to how this play turns out, too.
SK1303,849,Well, who knows? Nobody knows how things will turn out.
SK1303,850,But no matter what role you wind up with, so long as you give it your all, I know it'll turn out great.
SK1303,851,Captain...
SK1303,852,True, that might be tough.
SK1303,853,You think so too, huh, Boss?
SK1303,854,This is way too big of a role for me, huh...
SK1303,855,Sorry, Kanna. As the person picking the lead, there's nothing I can tell you.
SK1303,856,Ah... You're right.
SK1303,859,Good morning, Ogami.
SK1303,860,Good morning.
SK1303,861,Well? Ready to give your answer?
SK1303,862,...
SK1303,864,It's Kanna.
SK1303,865,Whaaa?! Boss... Me? Are you sure?
SK1303,866,Yes. Please, Kanna.
SK1303,867,...
SK1303,868,All right, you got it! I'll give it everything I've got for you, Boss!
SK1303,869,Papa, Mama, this is Mon Frère.
SK1303,870,I'm Ichiro Ogami. Please to meet you.
SK1303,871,It's been a long time. Thank you for your hospitality back when I went to France.
SK1303,872,It's been a long time, so let me introduce you again!
SK1303,873,This is my papa and mama!
SK1303,874,I'm Robert, Iris's father. Thank you for always looking after her.
SK1303,875,You may call me Marguerite. I'm Iris's mother.
SK1303,876,Iris has told us so much about you in her letters.
SK1303,877,Eheheh! Mama's really pretty, isn't she?
SK1303,878,You have a beautiful mother.
SK1303,879,Right? Right?
SK1303,880,When I grow up, I'm gonna be pretty just like her!
SK1303,881,She looks a lot like you, I was surprised.
SK1303,882,You're her spitting image, Iris.
SK1303,883,Uh-huh! I'm her child, after all!
SK1303,884,When I grow up, I'm gonna be pretty just like her!
SK1303,885,Your mother's beautiful, but so are you, Iris.
SK1303,886,Huh? Really?
SK1303,887,Yaaay! Mon Frère said I'm beautiful!
SK1303,888,...
SK1303,889,Ah! Mon Frère, you're blushiiiing!
SK1303,890,I'm gonna be just as pretty when I grow up, so just wait, OK?
SK1303,893,...
SK1303,896,Yes, sir. No matter what happens, I will protect Iris.
SK1303,897,Come visit again whenever you like.
SK1303,898,That way you can see Iris grow up, little by little.
SK1303,899,Iris...
SK1303,900,(Mon frere?)
SK1303,901,Uhhh... Mm...
SK1303,902,Ah... Was I... asleep?
SK1303,903,Oh my. Sorry for waking you up, Iris.
SK1303,904,I heard Mon Frère's voice and woke up.
SK1303,905,Hahaha, like Sleeping Beauty awoken by the prince's kiss.
SK1303,906,Huh? What did you say? Did Mon Frère... kiss me?
SK1303,907,...Huh?
SK1303,908,Hm hm hm... Maybe when you're a little older, Iris.
SK1303,909,N-Not you too...
SK1303,912,...
SK1303,913,Iris? What's wrong?
SK1303,914,...
SK1303,915,Iris... You're feeling lonely, aren't you?
SK1303,916,Why don't you say goodbye to them, just one more time?
SK1303,917,But...
SK1303,918,Iris... Go see them.
SK1303,919,Your Papa and Mama want to be with you.
SK1303,920,But... They have to stay behind while you head to battle.
SK1303,921,So that's why you need to tell them "I'm coming back."
SK1303,922,Really? Is it really OK?
SK1303,923,Yeah. Go to them.
SK1303,924,OK! Thank you, Mon Frère!
SK1303,925,I'm... starting to feel a little seasick.
SK1303,926,Huh? Are you OK, Mon Frère?
SK1303,927,Yeah, I'll be fine. It'll blow over eventually.
SK1303,928,So... Why don't you go talk to your parents until I feel better?
SK1303,929,Mon Frère...
SK1303,930,Thanks, Mon Frère. I'll be right back!
SK1303,931,Please, Mon Frère... Can I talk to my Papa and Mama one more time?
SK1303,932,...Yeah, sure. Go ahead.
SK1303,933,OK! Thank you, Mon Frère!
SK1303,934,Here it is, Mr. Howard's home. The first house I lived in when I came to Japan.
SK1303,935,Wow, so this is where you learned how to invent stuff, huh?
SK1303,936,Yup. Now let's head inside.
SK1303,937,We should ring the doorbell first, just in case. I think it's this button...
SK1303,938,OK, let's head inside!
SK1303,939,Wait, don't open that door!
SK1303,940,Huh?
SK1303,941,This door will explode if you don't ring the doorbell first.
SK1303,942,Really? Good thing I didn't open it, then.
SK1303,943,All right, I'm gonna ring the doorbell now.
SK1303,944,*cough* *cough*<br>Wh... What the...
SK1303,945,Ohh! You always gotta ring the doorbell before coming in!
SK1303,946,If ya don't, my Anti-Thief Trap will set a bomb off on ya!
SK1303,947,Pops... We DID ring the doorbell.
SK1303,948,Oh... For real? [Are you sure?] Oh, looks like I messed up the sensitivity...
SK1303,950,J-Just what I'd expect from Kohran's teacher...
SK1303,951,Now come in, you two, hurry along inside. Don't be shy!
SK1303,952,You must be all tuckered out from your long trip. Grab whatever seat you like over there.
SK1303,953,Right. Pardon me.
SK1303,954,Allow me to reintroduce you, Chief. This here's my teacher, Percy Howard!
SK1303,955,Howdy, Ogami! I've heard allll about ya from Kohran's letters!
SK1303,956,Hello, I'm Ichiro Ogami.
SK1303,957,Incidentally, that's an interesting dialect you've got, there.
SK1303,958,Oh, ya think so?
SK1303,959,Ever since I came to Japan, I've only ever traveled between Kyoto and Osaka, so that's why I talk like this!
SK1303,960,Which wound up rubbing off on me, too.
SK1303,961,I-I see...
SK1303,962,I am the captain of the Imperial Assault Troupe's Flower Division. Pleased to meet you.
SK1303,963,No, no, Ogami, ya don't gotta be so stiff! Loosen up a little!
SK1303,964,A simple "pleased to meetcha" will do! Just relax, OK? Relax!
SK1303,965,That's right, Chief. Howard will be happier if you loosen up a bit.
SK1303,966,R-Really? All right, I'll try.
SK1303,967,Pleased to meetcha!
SK1303,968,Hahaha! He's a funny man[, isn't he?] You're a real funny guy, Ogami!
SK1303,969,Yeah, Chief here's a real riot!
SK1303,970,Ever since I came to Japan, I've only ever traveled between Kyoto and Osaka, so that's why I talk like this!
SK1303,971,Which wound up rubbing off on me, too.
SK1303,972,I-I see...
SK1303,973,...
SK1303,974,...O-Oh? Was that all you had to say?
SK1303,975,You're a lot more reserved than I expected. Japanese people really are a quiet bunch.
SK1303,976,Well everyone's quiet compared to you, Howard!
SK1303,977,You must be Ichiro Ogami. Orihime told me all about you in her letters.
SK1303,978,I'm her mother, Carino. Thank you so much for being there for her.
SK1303,979,No need to thank me. I only did what I could.
SK1303,980,Orihime truly hated Japanese men, though.
SK1303,981,How were you able to get her to open up to you?
SK1303,982,I think it was all trust.
SK1303,983,Trusting each other, and responding to each other's trust in turn...
SK1303,984,I think that's how we came to understand each other.
SK1303,985,Hmhm, you're as corny as ever, Ensign.
SK1303,986,I understand completely. It's because I trusted in Seiya that I was able to wait until this day.
SK1303,987,Ogami, please keep believing in Orihime.
SK1303,988,All right.
SK1303,989,I think it was all patience.
SK1303,990,At first, even I didn't think we'd be able to get along.
SK1303,991,But I knew the day would come where she'd open up, so I just waited until then.
SK1303,992,...That makes me sound like a bad person.
SK1303,993,Hmhm, that's not it, Orihime. I understand what he means.
SK1303,994,I too waited a long time, just for this day... The day I could see Seiya again.
SK1303,995,Orihime... You should be thankful that Ogami waited for you for so long.
SK1303,996,Mamma...
SK1303,997,I think it was all love.
SK1303,998,W-Wait a second, Ensign! What's this all of a sudden?!
SK1303,999,Now, Orihime, expressing one's love is a very important thing.
SK1303,1000,I think it's fantastic that Ogami is able to profess his love so openly.
SK1303,1001,Mamma...
SK1303,1002,I... don't really know, either.
SK1303,1003,Hmhm, you're an honest man, Ogami.
SK1303,1004,I'm sure Orihime sensed that honesty too.
SK1303,1005,You're the man she chose. There's not a doubt in my mind that you're a wonderful person.
SK1303,1006,Orihime. You must always treasure Ogami's feelings for you.
SK1303,1007,Yes, Mamma. I understand.
SK1303,1008,Right... Ensign, could you come with me for a second?
SK1303,1009,Yeah, let's go.
SK1303,1010,...Thank you, Ensign.
SK1303,1011,Come with you where, exactly?
SK1303,1012,Whatever, it doesn't matter, just follow me!
SK1303,1013,H-Hey, Orihime, you don't need to pull!
SK1303,1014,...
SK1303,1015,Come on, Ensign, quit loafing around and hurry up already.
SK1303,1016,All right Papa, Mamma, we're going to be in the lounge upstairs.
SK1303,1017,Understood.
SK1303,1018,We'll stay right here, so take your time.
SK1303,1019,All right, let's go, Ensign.
SK1303,1020,Thank you for being so considerate, Ensign.
SK1303,1021,I bet Papa and Mamma have all kinds of things they want to talk about.
SK1303,1022,Jeez, you're so inconsiderate, Ensign.
SK1303,1023,Didn't you get the hint that we should leave them alone?
SK1303,1024,S-Sorry... I didn't notice.
SK1303,1025,...Sheesh, some things never change with you.
SK1303,1026,Anyway, I had no idea up till now...
SK1303,1027,No idea that Papa and Mamma loved each other that much...
SK1303,1028,Orihime...
SK1303,1029,I'm so glad they were finally able to reunite.
SK1303,1030,Yeah! It's great... It really is!
SK1303,1031,And it's all because you helped Papa and I patch things up.
SK1303,1032,Thank you so much, Ensign!
SK1303,1033,I'm actually jealous of them. I've never seen such a loving couple before.
SK1303,1034,They really are. But it's OK, I've already a found myself a partner.
SK1303,1035,You have? Who is it? Tell me, Orihime.
SK1303,1036,Heehee, whoever could it be?
SK1303,1037,I hope... we end up like them.
SK1303,1038,...Yeah. I'm sure we will.
SK1303,1039,Orihime...
SK1303,1040,All right, Ensign, until Papa and Mamma's conversation's dies down a bit...
SK1303,1041,Let's just stay up here a while, just the two of us.
SK1303,1042,Yeah, let's.
SK1303,1043,But at this rate, I don't think they'll be stopping till sunset.
SK1303,1044,Heeehee, oh, Ensign, that's perfectly all right.
SK1303,1045,Huh? Why's that?
SK1303,1046,Heehee... Because, that means we can be alone together for even longer.
SK1303,1047,...
SK1303,1049,...
SK1303,1050,Reni, it's me. I just want to talk for a minute. Will you open up?
SK1303,1051,...
SK1303,1052,...I'm coming in.
SK1303,1053,Sorry for barging in like this. I was just worried about what happened during your rehearsal.
SK1303,1054,...
SK1303,1056,...
SK1303,1057,Reni?
SK1303,1058,Captain...
SK1303,1059,...Reni?
SK1303,1060,I... I... What am I fighting for?
SK1303,1061,Huh?
SK1303,1062,I... I don't know what I'm fighting for anymore.
SK1303,1063,Captain... What is it that YOU'RE fighting for?
SK1303,1064,Well, you see...
SK1303,1065,I'm fighting to protect the capital. That's our duty as the Imperial Assault Troupe.
SK1303,1066,For justice, of course.
SK1303,1067,...Justice?
SK1303,1069,Heh, isn't it obvious? It's to find to the bluebird.
SK1303,1070,Now, let's look for the bluebird of happiness, together!
SK1303,1078,Reni, do not be deceived! You are a killing machine. Everyone else is your enemy!
SK1303,1079,That's not true! Reni, you have to believe in others!
SK1303,1080,Mon Frère, take this!
SK1303,1081,What... is that?!
SK1303,1082,Reni, you have to remember! Remember who you are! Remember who WE are!
SK1303,1083,The time we first met... The days we spent together... Have you completely forgotten?
SK1303,1084,Remember how Iris poured her heart into making this flower crown for you!
SK1303,1085,Urgh...
SK1303,1086,I didn't know how lost you felt, how anxious you felt, how lonely you felt...
SK1303,1088,But now... Now I can tell you exactly how I feel!

SK1306,9,Drop by the theater again whenever you like! We'll be waiting for ya!

SKCM02,4,Hi, Kohran. It's been a while.
SKCM02,5,Ah, it's you, Chief. You called me right away.
SKCM02,6,Well, you taught me how to use it. So...
SKCM02,7,Yaaay, it's Kohran! Ehehehe, Iris here!
SKCM02,8,Aha, even Iris is there! Let's move to the big screen, OK?
SKCM02,9,Hehe, I can hear you loud and clear. I can see Iris's face on screen, too.
SKCM02,10,I can see your face too!
SKCM02,11,The Hanayashiki Branch is close to the theater, so the reception is quite good.
SKCM02,12,Oh, right, right. I'll tell you something great.
SKCM02,13,Masked Red's radio show will be on air some time later.
SKCM02,14,Ooh... It sounds fun!

SKCM02,17,You can listen to some other broadcasts with Cinematron, too. Try listen to them.
SKCM02,18,I'm gonna go back to work now. See you later, guys.
SKCM02,19,Masked Red, huh... It sounds fun!
SKCM02,20,You're right, maybe I'll try to listen to it when I have some time.
SKCM02,21,Now... What to do next?
SKCM02,22,...Ooh, by the way, I heard all about your battle in front of the theater!
SKCM02,23,The Eisenkleid did really great, huh? Ah... I really wanna see it.

SKCM02,27,The Koubu Kai?
SKCM02,28,The Eisenkleid, I guess? It helped us quite a lot.

SKCM02,30,Hahaha, you really love to tinker with machines, don't you?
SKCM02,31,The Koubu Kai, I guess? It has balanced functions, so it's quite great.
SKCM02,32,Heh heh, it's because I adore and treat them special. 
SKCM02,33,I developed each of them based on your preferences.
SKCM02,34,Ooh, I didn't know that. No wonder it was easy to ride.
SKCM02,35,Hehehe. Thanks a lot, Chief.
SKCM02,36,Hmm... I can't tell which one.
SKCM02,37,Oh, so you can't tell. But I guess both are quite equal.
SKCM02,38,The Eisenkleid and the Koubu Kai must have equal abilities.
SKCM02,39,So... What would be their difference?
SKCM02,40,It's, "love." What matters most is love from the pilot and mechanic.
SKCM02,41,Eisenkleid is great, but actually... I'm doing something great too.
SKCM02,42,Look forward to it, 'kay? It'll be done soon.
SKCM02,43,OK, I gotta get back to work now. See you two later.
SKCM02,44,Good luck, Kohran! Bye-bye!
SKCM02,45,Kohran really likes machines, doesn't she?
SKCM02,46,Yeah... She looks so bright when we were talking about machines.
SKCM02,47,...Kohran's not answering.
SKCM02,48,She said that she's going back to work.
SKCM02,49,Oh, right. She said that.
SKCM02,50,Oh, Boss! And... there's Iris too.
SKCM02,51,Hi, Kanna. I thought that I should give you a call.
SKCM02,52,Hello...
SKCM02,53,Oh, Kanna! This is Ogami.
SKCM02,54,Oh, it's you, Boss!! You remembered my number!
SKCM02,55,Yaaay! It's Kanna, it's Kanna! So, so, are you fine?
SKCM02,56,Yeah, of course. Let's move to the big screen, then.
SKCM02,57,Hehe... Looks like you two are doing OK.
SKCM02,58,OK... What should we talk about?
SKCM02,59,Hello... Is this Ensign Ogami?
SKCM02,60,It's been a while, Ensign. My, is that Iris beside you?
SKCM02,61,Oh, Sumire, is that you?
SKCM02,62,What are you doing? Just when I'm the middle of a conversation with Boss.
SKCM02,63,Oh, Boss, it's you.
SKCM02,64,Oh, Kanna. So this is your call number.
SKCM02,65,Yeah, it is. So, what's your business?
SKCM02,66,Oh, it's you, Boss. What's your business?
SKCM02,67,Can you wait for a bit? I'm moving this to the big screen.
SKCM02,68,So, Boss, what's your business?
SKCM02,69,Uh... So... I thought what I did was wrong... 
SKCM02,70,Huh? So you're calling me just for that?
SKCM02,71,Uh... Sorry about earlier, Kanna. I went too far.
SKCM02,72,No biggie, Boss. I won't get angry just for that.
SKCM02,73,Hahaha, thank goodness. I'm gonna end the call now. See you later, Kanna.
SKCM02,74,Yeah, call me again later, OK?
SKCM02,75,...Looks like Kanna has gotten over her bad mood.
SKCM02,76,That's great, Mon Frère.
SKCM02,77,Hello, this is Kanna Kirishima.
SKCM02,78,Oh! Kanna, so this is your number.
SKCM02,79,Boss, it's you. You remembered my number.
SKCM02,80,Hm... It's you, Boss. Do you got something?
SKCM02,81,Can you wait for a bit? I'm moving this to the big screen.
SKCM02,82,I heard that you went on a mission right after you got back to the theater, Boss.
SKCM02,83,That's right! Enemies suddenly attacked the theater... 
SKCM02,84,But Mon Frère chased them away in a flash!
SKCM02,85,Oh, that so? Now that's our Boss.
SKCM02,86,OK! I won't lose to you, Boss.
SKCM02,87,I gotta train with more oomph! 
SKCM02,88,Later, Boss! You too, Iris. Be a good kid, OK?
SKCM02,89,I hope Kanna can get back soon.
SKCM02,90,You're right. She's the one who can brighten up our mood.
SKCM02,91,Kanna's not answering...
SKCM02,92,She must be went for training or eating.
SKCM02,93,Well, I can't get through to her.
SKCM02,94,Hello...
SKCM02,95,Hi, Sumire. It's Ogami.
SKCM02,96,My, you called my number right away, Ensign!
SKCM02,97,...Yes, hello?
SKCM02,98,Ah, Sumire! This is Ogami.
SKCM02,99,My, you remembered my number, Ensign!
SKCM02,100,Yaaay, it's Sumire! Long time no see!
SKCM02,101,My... Isn't that Iris?
SKCM02,102,Why don't we talk on the big screen, then?
SKCM02,103,So... You still can't go back here?
SKCM02,104,That's true! My family won't let me return.
SKCM02,105,Oh, dear me... What are they planning to do?
SKCM02,106,Hello. Is that you, Boss?
SKCM02,107,Oh... That voice, isn't that Kanna?
SKCM02,108,Yo, Boss. Oh... And Iris, too.
SKCM02,109,Hey, Kanna! I'm having a conversation with the ensign!
SKCM02,110,Oh my, Ensign...
SKCM02,111,Oh, Sumire, so this was your number?
SKCM02,112,Yes, that's true. By the way, is something the matter, Ensign?
SKCM02,113,My, Ensign... Is something matter?
SKCM02,114,Is something matter, Ensign?
SKCM02,115,Uh... I'm sorry about earlier. I went a bit too far.
SKCM02,116,Oh! So you're calling me only for that?
SKCM02,117,Yeah. I apologize for that.
SKCM02,118,Ensign...
SKCM02,119,I accept your thoughts, Ensign. Thank you very much.
SKCM02,120,That's great, Mon Frère. Sumire said thanks.
SKCM02,121,Right. I'm relieved to hear that.
SKCM02,122,I'm gonna end the call now. See you later, Sumire.
SKCM02,123,Yes, I'll excuse myself. Take care.
SKCM02,124,From now on, don't hurt woman's feeling again, Mon Frère.
SKCM02,125,Uhm... I-I'll be more careful next time.
SKCM02,126,...Hello?
SKCM02,127,Oh! Sumire, so this was your number?
SKCM02,128,My, Ensign... You remembered my number.
SKCM02,129,My, Ensign. Are you doing well?
SKCM02,130,Can you wait for a while? I'm going to move to the big screen.
SKCM02,131,Listen, Sumire! We're going to have a new member soon!!
SKCM02,132,Oh, didn't we already have a new member assigned to us last month?
SKCM02,133,Well, the other one will arrive right after lunch break.
SKCM02,134,I can't wait for it! I hope we can be friends.
SKCM02,135,I would love to return as well. I miss relaxing at the salon while enjoying my tea.
SKCM02,136,Right, you better come back quickly, Sumire! Everyone is waiting for you.
SKCM02,137,Ohohoho... Thank you very much.
SKCM02,138,Well then, I'll excuse myself. Take care.
SKCM02,139,OK... Which number should we reach next?
SKCM02,140,Sumire's not answering...
SKCM02,141,Maybe she went into another room?
SKCM02,142,Well, I can't get through to her.
SKCM02,143,G-Guys, calm down...
SKCM02,144,Good grief... Just when we're having a conversation, you came to ruin the mood.
SKCM02,145,You too! I'm talking with the boss now, don't get in my way!
SKCM02,146,The ensign wants to talk to ME!
SKCM02,147,No, it's ME! Right, Boss?
SKCM02,148,I wanna talk to...
SKCM02,149,Sumire
SKCM02,150,Kanna
SKCM02,151,Iris
SKCM02,152,I want to talk with Sumire...
SKCM02,153,Well, look at that. It's just like what I said, isn't it?
SKCM02,154,...Tch. I get it, sorry for intruding.
SKCM02,155,Ah... That Kanna, she doesn't need to end the call... 
SKCM02,156,Ah... She cut the call.
SKCM02,157,You two are acting like usual.
SKCM02,158,...A-Anyway! I'm absolutely going to slip out from Kanzaki Residence soon.
SKCM02,159,For this month's summer performance, please make sure you save one role for me to fill.
SKCM02,160,Oh boy... I didn't get to talk much, after all.
SKCM02,161,Will Sumire come home soon?
SKCM02,162,With that situation, I think it would be still difficult for her.
SKCM02,163,Now... What to do next?
SKCM02,164,I want to talk with Kanna...
SKCM02,165,Well, you hear that? Boss wants to talk with ME!
SKCM02,166,Huh, goodness! Then I'll withdraw myself from this conversation!
SKCM02,167,Uh...
SKCM02,168,Jeez, Sumire. There's no need to cut the call.
SKCM02,169,Oh boy... You two are acting like usual.
SKCM02,170,But you look worried, Kanna.
SKCM02,171,Do... Don't be ridiculous! Why should I... 
SKCM02,172,A-Anyway... I'm gonna go back to the theater next month!
SKCM02,173,Take care, you two! Later!
SKCM02,174,Oh boy... I didn't get to talk much, after all.
SKCM02,175,But Kanna said she'll go back next month. We can't wait for it, right?
SKCM02,176,Of course. I can talk to her easily whe she gets here.
SKCM02,177,Now... What to do next?
SKCM02,178,I want to talk with Iris...
SKCM02,179,Huh? Really, Mon Frère? Yaaay!
SKCM02,180,If you want to talk with her, don't you think there's no need to call us?
SKCM02,181,Oh, jeez! We're not gonna join this foolish thing.
SKCM02,182,Let's end this call, Kanna.
SKCM02,183,Yeah, I'm leaving. Later, Boss!
SKCM02,184,Ah, those two...
SKCM02,185,I'll listen to your stories!
SKCM02,186,Oh, thanks, Iris.
SKCM02,187,Now, what should I do now...
SKCM02,188,Uhm... About that... 
SKCM02,189,Asking the indecisive person like the ensign is such a mistake.
SKCM02,190,Yeah, you're right. No matter how long we'll wait, he won't answer.
SKCM02,191,I'm sort of losing my will to fight. I'm leaving first.
SKCM02,192,It's quite dissapointing that Kanna left.
SKCM02,193,I'll excuse myself. Take care, both of you.
SKCM02,194,That was great, Mon Frère! You stopped Kanna and Sumire's fight!
SKCM02,195,Uh... Well, let's just say that.
SKCM02,196,OK... What should I do next?
SKCM02,197,Hello, this is Maria Tachibana.
SKCM02,198,Hi, Maria. I thought that I should give you a call.
SKCM02,199,Yes. Who am I speaking to?
SKCM02,200,Oh! Maria, so this was your number?
SKCM02,201,Yahooo! Iris here!
SKCM02,202,Captain, Iris... Seems that you're both doing well.
SKCM02,203,Let's talk on the big screen.
SKCM02,204,Wow, we can talk with Maria in America! Awesome!!
SKCM02,205,Yes, thanks to Kohran's invention, this Cinematron.
SKCM02,206,I can see Iris is being active.
SKCM02,207,She's been doing great.
SKCM02,208,She's been a trouble.
SKCM02,209,She's been doing great.
SKCM02,210,She's been a trouble.
SKCM02,211,I'm doing great too.
SKCM02,212,Yeah, she's been doing great. Especially today.
SKCM02,213,Ehehe! It's because I'm with Mon Frère!
SKCM02,214,Having him came home has reaaally cheered me up!
SKCM02,215,Is that so? That's great.
SKCM02,216,Looks like you managed to bring all the members together, Captain.
SKCM02,217,Hahaha... Well, sort of.
SKCM02,218,Uh... I'm doing great too.
SKCM02,219,Oh, I'm sorry, Captain. I kept talking only with Iris.
SKCM02,220,Seeing that you're doing well is more than enough for me, Captain.
SKCM02,221,Mon Frère is doing OK because I'm with him!
SKCM02,222,Yeah, she's been too active that it troubles me.
SKCM02,223,Mon Frère, you meanie! Are you saying that I shouldn't be active?!
SKCM02,224,She's right, Captain. That was too far of you.
SKCM02,225,Ah... S-Sorry, I was joking for a bit.
SKCM02,226,Even if you say so, this isn't an acceptable situation. 
SKCM02,227,You need to watch what are you going to express.
SKCM02,228,I-I'm sorry. I'll keep that in mind.
SKCM02,229,...
SKCM02,230,Ah... I'm sorry, Captain. I kept talking only with Iris.
SKCM02,231,No, not at all. You two are having fun, so it's fine.
SKCM02,232,You're really kind, Mon Frère!
SKCM02,233,Iris, I won't be able to return to Japan until this summer, so... 
SKCM02,234,Make sure you listen what the captain says.
SKCM02,235,OK!
SKCM02,236,Well now, I'm going to end the call, Captain. Good luck at there.
SKCM02,237,It's great we could talk with Maria, isn't it, Mon Frère?
SKCM02,238,Yeah, you're right.
SKCM02,239,...Maria's not answering.
